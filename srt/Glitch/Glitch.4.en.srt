1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,764
Jihyo.
Do you really not remember anything?

2
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,899
Hm... Is there anything
that comes to mind?

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,818
You can tell me, okay?

4
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,452
Why did you go there in the first place?

5
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,915
Just to...

6
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,835
meet a friend.

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,961
A friend?

8
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,756
Tell us, who's this friend?

9
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,139
You know that scrap car that you played in
with your friend, right?

10
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,225
Well you see, I found
a few empty alcohol bottles in there.

11
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,650
Did you maybe... maybe drink
anything else with your friend?

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,487
What?

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,158
That friend of yours,
her name is Bora, right? Bora.

14
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>Hey, Bora</i>.

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>Hey, what are you doing? Hey!</i>

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,504
- ...for teaching, rebuking...
- Fuck off, I need to record this.

17
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,315
- ...righteousness...
- What did you say?

18
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,341
I'll get one shot in
before the battery dies.

19
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,819
- Hold on, what are you doing? Hey!
<i>- ♪ Sella ♪</i>

20
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,638
- Don't open it.
- Give us the courage to take down...

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,158
- Ugh... Let go, all right?
- ...the tents of ignorant souls.

22
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,160
- Please forgive those...
- Come on, let go.

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,477
...flesh and spirit.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,729
<i>Sella.</i>

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,064
No...

26
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,583
- You showed...
- Hey!

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,085
Tell it to get off.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,693
Get it away from me!

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,737
<i>Get it away! Tell it to get away!</i>

30
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,031
<i>- Don't let it come this way!

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,201

Justin Bieber, come here!</i>

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,814
<i>- Bora. Be quiet, please! Justin Bieber!
- Ah, fuck.</i>

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,998
You called me
this early in the morning for this?

34
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,167
Think I could...
could make a teaser outta this?

35
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,919
Like a minute long?

36
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,089
You didn't get any footage.
It's just a bunch of whispering.

37
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,591
Tell me, how long did you end up
being stuck in that closet?

38
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,509
Eleven hours...

39
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,594
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa, damn, dude!

40
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,513
Who are you, Prince Sado?

41
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,874
- Follow the real estate lady.
- Go to the police.

42
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,234
Are you insane?

43
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,445
Ugh, why do you always insist on
asking cops for help? They're useless.

44
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,948
Well, why do you always insist
that they're useless?

45
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,191
Seriously, what's your point?

46
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,413
First of all, I don't trust cops, okay?

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,496
And second...

48
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,208
they won't be able to help
with any of this anyway.

49
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,501
All right, why?

50
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,254
Here.

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,340
67.7volts per meter.

52
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,718
That was the EMF reading
from your boyfriend's place.

53
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,348
This is exactly what you spent your
nights looking for like crazy in school.

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,686
Listen, Bora...

55
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,106
Those weird people we saw earlier,
they were just people.

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,193
They weren't aliens, all right? Huh?

57
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,486
So those suspicious guys were right there,

58
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,364
so, um... why is this important right now?

59
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,448
Okay.

60
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,953
Well, this means those people are
the real evidence, then. You saw it too.

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,873
You saw it with your own eyes,
where your boyfriend vanished.

62
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,459
Do you really think
that's something a human being could do?

63
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,795
Look, I'm telling you,
those freaks definitely know things.

64
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,006
That's why I'm saying we should trail her.

65
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,681
DAD

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,624
- That's not what's important right now.
- Where are you going?

67
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,316
- The police station.
- Ugh, seriously?

68
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,984
I'm sick of repeating myself!

69
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,527
Excuse me?

70
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,492
There's nothing else we can do
about this right now, all right?

71
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,495
Are you chickening out?

72
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,248
All right.

73
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,835
I mean... your boyfriend's life is at stake

74
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,255
and you're too scared
to try and solve it yourself.

75
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,178
It's rather obvious
that you can't let this go.

76
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,175
So just go file your fucking
report and be done.

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,970
- It's all too much, huh?
- "I can't do this."

78
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,733
Isn't that what you're thinking right now?

79
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,683
Hey!

80
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,519
I think we can do this, don't you?

81
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,313
So come on, I'm asking you
to trust me just this once!

82
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,607
Huh?

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,988
How could I ever trust you, Bora?

84
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,617
I've already gotten burned
once trusting you, you know?

85
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,247
Because of you,
I was passed out for three days.

86
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>You don't even remember, do you?</i>

87
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,253
<i>You...</i>

88
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,257
<i>You just left me there, all by myself.</i>

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,971
Did you even bother to look around?

90
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,229
You really think I didn't?

91
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,231
<i>Hey, Jihyo!</i>

92
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,358
Jihyo!

93
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,193
Hey, Jihyo!

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,239
Hong Jihyo! Please answer me!

95
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,491
The one who supposedly
made you sniff glue...

96
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,161
Don't you remember what happened?

97
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,499
You do realize that I was
completely unconscious, right?

98
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,959
So you just totally cut me off

99
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,211
over something that you don't even
remember correctly?

100
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,838
I cut you off? You did that!

101
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,561
It was you, you fucking bitch, all right?

102
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,632
Hey, Hong Jihyo!

103
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,263
What's going on? Hey, are you all right?

104
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,765
When did you wake up?

105
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,351
Didn't you get my texts?
Why didn't you an...

106
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,734
Hi there.

107
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
How about you come
and chat with me for a minute?

108
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,198
Huh? All right, let's go.

109
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,242
What's going on?
What are you doing?

110
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,327
Hey, Jihyo.

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,911
Jihyo!

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,678
Not much on camera. You'll just
be making a video for her Moonhole TV.

113
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,015
Whoa! I mean, that's the church lady
breaking into a house, right?

114
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,059
Pyew, pyew. There's someone
who uploaded useless content.

115
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,853
Pyew, pyew. Pyew, pyew.

116
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,023
- Pyew, pyew, pyew, pyew!
- Pyew, pyew, pyew, pyew!

117
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,109
- Hey, Cap.
- Huh?

118
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,613
In the military, what was your title
again? You were special... special...

119
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,282
I was Special Forces, Special NCO. Why?

120
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,285
So was that sorta like, uh...
Um, like <i>The Iron Squad</i> or something?

121
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,043
Instead of using the 'pyew pyew'
sound here, I think we could...

122
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,126
Pwssh!

123
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,224
Try gettin' outta this!

124
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,226
Come on, just try. Huh?

125
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,020
Whoa!

126
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,237
This is great!

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,821
What are you saying, huh?

128
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,785
Cap, hey.
What are you up to later?

129
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,915
SEOUL GEOAN POLICE STATION

130
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,333
A prayer?

131
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,545
It wasn't just any normal prayer. At all.

132
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,674
You're saying the prayer was suspicious?
How so?

133
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,136
It was like they were speaking in tongues.
Like, uh...

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,438
<i>...Sellaaaa!</i>

135
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,779
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,072
Jeez. Ahem...

137
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,574
So, anyway...

138
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,078
You think that those people
might have kidnapped Mr. Lee?

139
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,374
I'm not exactly sure how, but I'm telling
you, they're connected to this.

140
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,657
If they weren't, why were
they in Siguk's house doing...

141
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,758
Wait.

142
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,095
If you saw those people, then...

143
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,472
that means you were inside the house?

144
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,435
You...

145
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,856
Hey you didn't break
into that house, did you?

146
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,652
No... no, I didn't.

147
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,448
Seriously, you didn't!

148
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,617
But, Detective,
why are you upset with me when...

149
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,577
They're the ones who broke in as a group!

150
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,747
All right, look, I get that you're
suspicious, but come on, seriously?

151
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,749
How far are you gonna take this, huh?

152
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,001
This is the police's work, you know?

153
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,380
And, listen, I already gave you all
of Mr. Lee's bank records and everything!

154
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,134
Seriously.

155
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,237
Gawa Competition Team, this is Sehee.

156
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,284
Oh! Jihyo's father, hello! Huh?

157
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,495
Another man, sir?

158
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,498
Jihyo did?

159
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:09,168
She didn't come home yesterday.
I bet she was with him.

160
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,837
He's even been to our house before.

161
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,591
It looks like she's been
meeting with some police officer.

162
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,427
- Some kind of detective or something.
- Police officer?

163
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,971
<i>I'm only saying this because
it's you, you know, but...</i>

164
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,265
<i>she's not doing so great these days.</i>

165
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,189
<i>And she's been getting
into weird things again.</i>

166
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,811
Weird things? Really, sir?

167
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,690
Uh, well... when she was little,
she had quite an obsession.

168
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,152
<i>I'm sorry to ask, but... has Jihyo been
having any problems at the company?</i>

169
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,697
- Uh...
<i>- She's doing all right at work, right?</i>

170
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,574
<i>Look... Sehee.</i>

171
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,371
<i>I realize how shameless it is
of me to ask you to do this, but...</i>

172
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,916
<i>Do you think maybe you could...
meet with Jihyo</i>

173
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,419
<i>and have a serious conversation with her?</i>

174
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,132
I mean, Sehee, you're...
Jihyo's closest friend, isn't that right?

175
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,385
Before we get started,
let's look into some companies.

176
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,845
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

177
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,514
- Last time...</i>
- You can count on me, sir.

178
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,854
Did you see the listing?
It's completely new.

179
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,771
- Uh, yeah.
- Sure.

180
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,066
Honestly, the timing
for you guys coming here was crazy.

181
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,025
Ah...

182
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,028
You know how expensive
leasing apartments is lately, right?

183
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,699
- Yeah, of course.
- I think the landlord may be a bit green.

184
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,845
- I'm shocked he put it up at this price.
- She's the leader of the cult?

185
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,580
Not the leader.
But they mentioned "Sister," or something.

186
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,624
Sure, I get that,
but why are you filming this woman?

187
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,209
She hasn't done anything weird.

188
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,133
She's done nothing but
show houses all morning.

189
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,797
We're too far
to pick up any audio.

190
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,424
Cap, let's get a little closer.

191
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,634
Are you nuts? Let's just go.

192
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
Apart from being completely illegal,

193
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,931
this is just super inefficient,
and basically stalking.

194
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,516
You didn't have to come with us.

195
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,352
We could've done without your grumbling,
all right, huh?

196
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,613
Yeah, but I don't wanna
be at the café alone.

197
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,857
- Oh! She's leaving.
- Oh, let me see.

198
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,360
Cap, let's roll!

199
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,738
Where could she be headed now?

200
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,449
Probably to another
lucrative neighborhood.

201
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,910
Yes, I'm telling you.
It's a fantastic investment!

202
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,705
When the area gets redeveloped,
it'll be worth millions. Mmm!

203
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,792
Oh my.
Listen, I'm gonna meet another client.

204
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,837
I might lose you when I go in,
so I'll give you a call later, okay?

205
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,005
Great, bye!

206
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,007
Hey! Wait, hold on! Oh!

207
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,506
Ahh!

208
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,176
Hey, why'd you want me to come?
Why am I here?

209
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,761
- Bodyguard.
- Why?

210
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,222
You mean... we're gonna fight?

211
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,808
I mean, if we get caught, we might, yeah.

212
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,727
Also... it's a little less of a "we," okay?

213
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,187
Just you while I run.

214
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,481
Ugh. Fighting makes me lose muscle.

215
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,860
Cap, hey.

216
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,863
Do you ever feel like
going back to the military?

217
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,072
No, I'm good.

218
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,825
Yeah sure but, selling coffee
can't be your dream job, right?

219
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,203
I mean, well... do you feel
as alive as you did back then?

220
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,331
Or, maybe, um...
There's no way there aren't times

221
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,793
where you miss being out on
the battlefield, fighting for your life.

222
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,461
Uh... right?

223
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,087
Uh, I don't.

224
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,174
Yeah, no, I'm good. I can
say I'm happy with my life.

225
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,680
Would you please stop shaking that!
How much more do you need, seriously?

226
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,855
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

227
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,233
<i>Light be with you.
I will read the message of Light.</i>

228
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,777
<i>From chapter two, line 17.</i>

229
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,490
<i>"Therefore, according to the Divine Light,
do not be hindered."</i>

230
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,261
<i>- The path you are walking...</i>
- Should we go in soon?

231
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,912
- What do you think?
- Yeah, sure.

232
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>May the path you are walking
down be the right one.</i>

233
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,123
<i>Sella.</i>

234
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,666
<i>Sella.</i>

235
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,669
<i>Sella.</i>

236
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,299
Ah! Thank you for coming,
I'm happy you both made it!

237
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,010
- Sister, this is your first time with us?
- Uh...

238
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,471
Which member invited you here, huh?

239
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,390
What's that?

240
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,736
What exactly were you two just recording?

241
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,829
This is all of it?

242
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>Hey, Donghyuk,
what are you doing?</i>

243
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>Donghyuk, look here. Come on! Look at me!</i>

244
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,549
<i>Donghyuk, you moron.</i>

245
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,969
You sure you didn't record anything else?

246
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,056
Tell me why you brought this.

247
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,401
It's true, we're a cult.

248
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
We're aware.

249
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,532
We know how we might look to outsiders.

250
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,827
Especially in the eyes of mainstream
churches, we're just a cult.

251
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,912
Nothing more, nothing less.

252
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,331
We're all used to it now.

253
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,084
To being the laughing stock.

254
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,754
That's why we don't like being recorded.

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,008
So some discretion would be appreciated.

256
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
But what sort of...

257
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,137
Now, I'd like to ask you to please leave.

258
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,597
Sir. Let's go.

259
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,767
Come on. Come on!

260
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,852
Let's go.

261
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,562
Come... Hey.

262
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,898
I came here to die, you know...

263
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,859
What?

264
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,949
That's why I was headed to the rooftop.

265
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,580
But when the elevator door
opened, and I saw you guys, so happy...

266
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,790
I mean, shit!

267
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,711
I came here to die, you know,
and... and here you all were laughing.

268
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,797
So what exactly do you want from us, then?

269
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,216
Well...

270
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,472
Can't you please fill me in too...

271
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,349
on what's so funny?

272
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,852
Just how does everyone look so happy here?

273
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,104
I mean what's the big secret, huh?

274
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,907
Brother Kim, I heard
that we have some guests?

275
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,867
Ah, yes. Sister Kim.

276
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,203
- I was just chatting with them.
- So, this is them.

277
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,205
Ah, so these are our guests.

278
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,331
Oh, wow!

279
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,583
This man's frame is... Wow!

280
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,627
Ah, wow, just...

281
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,880
I mean, how do you even
build all this muscle?

282
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,174
Oh my, goodness.

283
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,593
Well, through
progressive overload and training...

284
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,058
What's wrong with her?

285
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,477
She's just been through some stuff lately.

286
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,104
You did good by coming here.

287
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,647
- Oh, don't cry, okay?
- Don't cry.

288
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,565
Oh, goodness. Oh...

289
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,109
Huh...

290
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,200
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH
A DEDICATED SERVICE

291
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,283
Uh...

292
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,372
Name's Kwak Dajung, and, uh... well...

293
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,374
Light be with you.

294
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,001
Welcome, Dajung, welcome Brother Kwak.

295
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,212
Please continue, we're listening.

296
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,258
Ah, right.
I'm 35 years old, uh...

297
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,051
I own a café, and um...

298
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,220
and my hobby's weight training.

299
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,390
I don't really like powerlifting,
I focus on bodybuilding, you see...

300
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,767
- Uh...
- That moment. Have you felt it yet?

301
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,477
- Sorry?
- Ah, well.

302
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,161
I believe she's asking whether
you've met the Beautiful Light yet.

303
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,108
- Am I right, Sister? Is that right?
- Ah, yes.

304
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,776
You see, there are a few members here

305
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,362
who have been able to meet the Light
before coming here.

306
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:20,159
Uh... Since you just mentioned "light,"
I was a bit confused about what kind.

307
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,077

MOONHOLE TV IS BROADCASTING

<i>Shit, this is real.</i>

466
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,011
<i>Are these the guys who
kidnapped Direct Kim's daughter?</i>

467

<i>This is why I still follow you, Moonhole.</i>

468

<i>Today's stream was legendary.</i>

469
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,228
<i>Whoa, this is insane. Wow.</i>

470
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,354
<i>This is legit.</i>

471
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,860
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

472
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,737
<i>Amazing.</i>

473
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,949
<i>Moonhole, where did you even find
these people? Where did you find them?</i>

474
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,243

<i>Who are they?</i>

478
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,627
<i>Hey, tell us where you are!</i>

479
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,378
Hey, guys, did you see that?

480
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,215
<i>I told you I'd do it!</i>

481
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,927
I said I'd find those bastards in the
Direct Kim case, isn't that right, guys?

482
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,679
Jesus.

483
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,811
That crazy bitch, seriously.

484
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,730
Ah! I fucking did it!

485
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,533
- Hey, Jihyo?
- Huh?

486
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,037
Huh? What have you been watching, hm?
Can we talk for a minute, huh?

487
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,871
Sure.

488
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,375
Shit!

489
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,595
You haven't been answering me lately.

490
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,807
I was really worried, I thought
something happened to you, you know?

491
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,059
- And you were even late today. Again.
- Oh...

492
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,104
I had some things to take care of.

493
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,816
Let go!

494

<i>Phillip! Hey, it's Petite Jihyo!</i>

502
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,978
Ah, yeah. I saw the broadcast!

503

Hey, send me Bora's location, please.
Right now!

Yes, please.
Detective Kim, I need your help!

509

<i>What?
Miss Hong, what's the matter?</i>

510
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,288
<i>I think something bad happened

Hallelujah! Great work today, everyone!

513

Excuse me.

514

Hey, you! Hey, wait! Hey!

515
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,393
You...

516
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,897
Hey! Wait...

517
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,239
Oh!

518
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,121
What's wrong with you?

519
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,555
Get out!

520
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,348
Come on.

521
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,686
Hey! Where is she?

522
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,979
Huh?

523
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,065
The police are on their way,
so don't try anything funny, huh?

524
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,817
Where's my friend?

525
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,944
Where did you take her?

526
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,785
Oh, oh!

527
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,163
Officer! Here, over here!

528
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,373
Officer! Right here!

529
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,460
- Officer! It's this man here!
- Ma'am, get off the man!

530
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,895
- Grab her. Get her arms.
- Huh? No!

531
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,964
- Ma'am, calm down.
- You gotta take him! It's him, not me!

532
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,508
- All right, ma'am...
- No, but why me?

533
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,926
That man's from a cult!

534
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,595
Hey!

535
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,430
Bora!

536

LETTER OF APOLOGY

537
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,601
I don't want
to press charges.

538
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,062
A sincere letter of
apology will be enough.

539
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,481
All right, sir.

540
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,651
Things like this are inevitable for
someone who leads a religious life.

541
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,113
More so since we have...
a somewhat unique doctrine.

542
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,700
Some people have an issue with that.

543
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,540
Anyway, if it's possible, I'd like to...
I'd like to let this incident slide.

544
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,708
Oh, right.

545
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,129
Ms. Hong, you heard him, right?

546
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,801
Sir, uh, could you...

547
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,387
With all due respect, what, um...

548
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,474
What sort of... religion
do you follow, specifically?

549
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,143
Ah, well... we're technically
a Christian denomination,

550
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,521
but we aren't
an officially recognized religious body.

551
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,730
Christian? Yeah, right.

552
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,649
Hey, now!

553
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,901
Can you stop acting up? Please, Jihyo.

554
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,654
Continue, sir.

555
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,909
Well, aside from... our doctrine,
the business is properly registered.

556
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,328
Uh, and all the taxes are being paid.

557
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,831
Hmm, so you must be paying taxes
to the aliens, huh?

558
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,332
Hey! Come on.

559
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,761
Anyway, Detective,
why did you ask?

560
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,169
Ah, yes, um-

561
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,048
Well, we have to confirm
a few things, you understand.

562
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:32,221
Uh... See, we dispatched our officers
because of a report that you and...

563
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,516
and, um...
and your unique church...

564
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,560
were involved in a kidnapping.

565
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,895
Wow, wow, wow. Wait. A kidnapping?

566
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,064
Are you talking about these two here?

567
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,528
Hmm.

568
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,409
As you can see, that's clearly not true.

569
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,953
Yes, clearly.

570
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,539
That's not all, though.

571
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,626
There are two more at least
that I know of.

572
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,296
Someone's daughter and my boyfriend.

573
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,922
Huh?

574
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,888
You know what this is, right?

575
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,557
You were supposed to write an apology.
Come on, what is that?

576
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,938
This shape was where
my boyfriend disappeared.

577
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,941
The very same one was
seen at your "unique" church.

578
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,485
What are you saying?

579
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,528
Would you like to explain?

580
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,200
You see now?
Look at him clam up all of a sudden.

581
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,577
Bora. You saw this earlier, am I right?

582
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,204
Go tell them, huh?

583
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,247
Huh? Tell 'em what?

584
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,001
Bora. But the thing.

585
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,753
The... the thing you saw at the church,

586
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,380
where they shot lasers at the walls
and they showed this.

587
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,840
Showed this sign.

588
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,468
Cap, hey. Remember that?

589
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,095
Remember what?

590
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,681
I'm sorry, we have no idea.

591
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,727
Come on, Bora, come on!

592
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,315
You recorded all this, you saw the whole
thing! Why are you denying all this now?

593
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,151
- What are you talking about right now?
- Hey!

594
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,486
What the hell are you saying?

595
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,531
- Do you even know how much I donated?
- Hey, hey, hey! Stop! Enough!

596
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,115
Okay, okay, all right.

597
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,201
Jihyo. Calm down.

598
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,537
Why...

599
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,499
- Wait, hold on, why are you targeting me?
- Okay, I believe everyone can go home now.

600
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,960
- We're all basically done here.
- Okay. Let's go.

601
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,044
Mm-hm.

602
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,256
- All right.
- Thank you, Detective.

603
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,319
- I'll go, too.
- Wait, Bora.

604
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,971
Yes, please do. Sir, I'll be calling you.

605
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,514
Of course, thank you so much!

606
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,224
- But where are you...
- Ms. Hong.

607
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,227
I'm going to need you
to finish that letter.

608
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,896
You don't want to be sued, right?

609
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,151
Oh, God.

610
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,156

611
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,494

- Whoo! Whoo!
- Whoo!

621
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,060
CLOSED FOR TODAY

622
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,146
Wow.

623
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,401
Hey, troll!
Our newest member, Petite Auntie!

624
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,069
Come on. Let's drink.

625
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,952
Seems like you're having fun.

626
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,331
What's wrong?

627
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,414
Yeah?

628
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,049
You stabbed me in the back.

629
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,635
What the fuck are you doing right now?

630
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,474
Jesus, my poor ears!

631
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,267
Hey, don't yell at me.

632
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,227
You'll ruin my buzz, 'kay?

633
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,524
What happened to you earlier?

634
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,526
And what was that at the police station?

635
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,780
So tell me, are you happy
you made me look like an idiot?

636
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,239
Huh? You some kinda psycho?

637
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,117
Hey, didn't I tell you not
to trust those guys, huh?

638
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,703
I didn't wanna give
them any info, all right?

639
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,748
- What else was I supposed to do?
- That doesn't even-

640
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,586
CONGRATS ON 1000 FOLLOWERS!

641
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,803
Hold on. Did you use
my money for all this?

642
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,554
Of course not.

643
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,182
It is mine now.

644
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,351
It was a donation, after all.

645
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,689
Hey, Bora!

646
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,357
Oh, Christ!

647
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,193
Come on, what's with the yelling?

648
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,654
What do you want me to say?
What am I supposed to do, huh?

649
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,615
- Seriously?
- Ow!

650
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,700
Say sorry.

651
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,994
Say that you're sorry.
I got handcuffed 'cause of you.

652
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,788
I deserve at least a sorry.

653
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,250
No, you don't.

654
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,752
I think <i>you </i>should say sorry.

655
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
Yeah? You think so?

656
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,052
Sure do.

657
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,180
I mean, you made me look
like an idiot, so yeah.

658
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,725
- When was this?
- You said you couldn't trust me.

659
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,185
Said you'd trust the police over me.

660
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,021
So there. So did I miss
anything, or is that it?

661
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,941
Hey! Hey!

662
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,486
Hey, I... honestly nearly thought you...
you...

663
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,948
that you were a pretty cool person
when you did that... the stream, whatever.

664
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:46,326
You just barged into that crazy cult
without even batting an eyelash!

665
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,703
You just went in like an idiot!

666
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,373
You know, I admired you for one tiny
second! But then you went and did that?

667
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,668
- Now they think I'm a psycho!
- Who are you calling a psycho?

668
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,378
Hey, I used my head to get in there.

669
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,088
But you busted in alone without a plan!

670
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,841
Oh, aren't you just so fucking cool!
Who are you?

671
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,176
- Fucking Liam Neeson?
- Hey.

672
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,139
- Are they each other's fans or haters?
- Bora, are you really not sorry?

673
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,513
- Haters are fans too.
- Yeah.

674
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,223
Do you realize how fucking scared I was?

675
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:12,060
Well, if it was that scary, why did you
even fucking bother? Why come anyway?

676
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,813
It's my choice!

677
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,941
It's my choice!

678
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,152
<i>What is it?</i>

679
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,822
Look, Jihyo, it's pretty obvious
that you have something to say.

680
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,323
What is wrong?

681
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,870
Did Park Sunyoung say something to you?

682
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,125
She said I should avoid you.

683
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,543
That you're a delinquent.

684
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,380
She said...

685
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,425
she saw you with some boys.

686
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,678
She said she saw you sniffing glue.

687
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,306
Look, I don't believe her.

688
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,643
I don't, 'cause you promised
you wouldn't do it again.

689
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,231
And anyway, I mean,
she didn't have any proof.

690
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,027
Yeah, but why do you trust me, huh?

691
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
I mean, I can't prove anything either.

692
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,244
Hm. Because it's my choice.

693
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,332
It's my personal choice
to believe something or not.

694
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,586
It's my choice!

695
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,214
Seriously...

696
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,884
Wow.

697
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,428
So frustrating, seriously.

698
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,513
Ugh, God!

699
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,190
Are we sure they're adults? Yeesh.

700
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,155
Hey, hold on.

701
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,742
What... Oh.

702
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,370
Is this alcohol?

703
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,043
Yeah.

704
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,425
Oh, damn it...

705
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,176
I can't drink alcohol.

706
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,563
Hey, Hong Jihyo.

707
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,322
Wanna go somewhere tomorrow?

708
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,535
Mm-hm.

709
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,580
Sure, yeah, let's go.

710
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,416
Let's go...

711
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,377
Let's do it.

712
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,632
Go...

713
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,921
Oh, Jesus...

714
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,020
"Someone's daughter."

715
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,859
CASE SEARCH

716
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,904
2014 - ELDERLY MASS SUICIDE
HOPE & LIGHT ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY

717
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,409
Hmm...

718
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,307
Huh...

719
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,050
How the hell are you still this drunk?

720
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,969
Well, how the hell are you totally fine?

721
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,394
Hey. About the church yesterday.

722
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,732
You remember how
the real estate lady levitated?

723
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,900
Yeah?

724
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,737
It's weird but an image just popped
into my head right when she did it.

725
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,364
Really, hm?

726
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,120
Yeah, it was really weird.

727
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,872
What was it?

728
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,754
Why did you just stop speaking?

729
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,550
Seriously?

730
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,553
Ugh.

731
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,430
Hurry up.

732
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,698
So, uh... Where are we, anyway?

733
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,284
Just wait a minute, you'll see.

734
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,495
Whose house is this?

735
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,292
Hey. Look, I rang, didn't I?

736
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,044
So now someone will come out, right?

737
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,421
And then you'll find out, am I right?

738
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,436
- Looks like no one's coming out.
- Fuck, just wait. It's the right place.

739
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,025
Is it really a problem
telling me whose house we're at?

740
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,195
What the hell? Where is he?

741
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,780
Is he asleep?

742
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,284
Hint.

743
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,077
It's a man.

744
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,912
Do I know this man?

745
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,454
Yeah.

746
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,374
- Phillip.
- No.

747
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,792
- Donghyuk.
- No.

748
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,460
- Cap, then.
- No.

749
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,796
Ugh!

750
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,632
Tell me it's not Detective Kim's!

751
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,676
Come on, why would I go to a cop's house?

752
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,639
I mean, who else could they be?
That's, like, all the men we know.

753
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,684
- Where is he?
- repeatedly

754
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,650
There!

755
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,612
Say hello.

756
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,946
This is Mr. Direct Kim.

757
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,115
What?

758
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,034
I heard your boyfriend went missing.

759
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,369
Huh?

760
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,881
Are you going to come in or what?

761
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,258
Whoa, why is your house so empty?

762
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,344
It's like a storage closet.
