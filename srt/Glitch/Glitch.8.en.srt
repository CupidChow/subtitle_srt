1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>Hey, Hong Jihyo.
Pull yourself together.</i>

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,260
<i>It's white...</i>

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,888
<i>White?</i>

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,515
<i>White all around me.</i>

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,185
<i>Everything.</i>

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>There aren't any walls.</i>

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>There's no floor.</i>

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>But they...</i>

9
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>they chose me for a reason.</i>

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>Who are they?</i>

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,118
It's the same...

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,954
as Back Yoonsun's interview.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>- Jihyo, listen to me.
- Huh?</i>

14
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>- What do they want from you?
- Th...</i>

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>What did they put in your head?</i>

16
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,215
<i>Ah. They're...</i>

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,343
<i>They're all speaking to me.</i>

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,055
<i>What?
What language are they speaking?</i>

19
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,516
<i>Hey, say that again.</i>

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>- Jihyo! Hey! Say something!</i>
- Hong Jihyo!

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>Snap out of it! Hey!</i>

22
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,078
And so it is...

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,666
What does all of this even mean?

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,294
It means you've made contact with aliens.

25
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,630
When you disappeared back in middle school

26
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,799
at our hideout in the field of reeds.

27
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,301
That's when you met the aliens. Yeah.

28
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,512
What?

29
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,561
Uh...

30
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,359
Um, hey, Bora...

31
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,112
So you knew all of this?

32
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,071
Yeah.

33
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>Yeah, I went over to your house
after you left the hospital.</i>

34
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,255
<i>I went there to tell you everything.</i>

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,636
Oh...

36
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,388
Hey.

37
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,765
Do you...

38
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,101
do you really not remember anything?

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,647
You know, all the things
that you saw, heard.

40
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,566
Really nothing?

41
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,901
I really can't remember.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,989
Only the field of reeds with you.

43
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,242
When we were together.

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,126
Field of reeds...

45
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,630
Do you wanna go there?

46
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,508
Huh?

47
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,592
Go there...

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,553
If I go in person,

49
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,598
and see it, maybe It will spark my memory?

50
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,186
Let's go.

51
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,773
- Uh...
- Uh, hi, Doc...

52
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,650
Thank you for today.

53
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,445
Sorry, it's late. We'll get going.

54
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,697
- Let's go. Bye, now!
- Hey, hey.

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,574
- Thank you!
- Jihyo, hold on! Wait!

56
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,575
Just a minute.

57
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,080
I'll be smoking downstairs, 'kay?

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,597
Take a seat.

59
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,683
I'm really sorry,
but seriously, I can't talk for long.

60
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,914
- What was that earlier? Huh?
- Listen, I'll tell you everything later.

61
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,981
Okay? I'm really sorry.

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,899
I have to go.

63
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,192
Hey, Jihyo. Hey, Hong Jihyo!

64
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,319
Listen, I really don't have time
for this, okay?

65
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,322
You need the hospital. Seriously.

66
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,116
No, not like this. A real... real hospital.

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,452
Where you can get a proper consultation.

68
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,496
No...

69
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,458
I'm sick and tired of hospitals.

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,502
I'm leaving.

71
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,002
Hey, Hong Jihyo!

72
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,340
Hey, Jihyo! Hey, Jihyo! Hong Jihyo!

73
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
Hey, Jihyo!

74
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,971
Where did you go?

75
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,514
Answer me!

76
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,662
Oh shit. Please just gimme a minute.

77
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,204
Ah...

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,166
Was...

79
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,918
was our hideout around here?

80
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,255
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,467
So the place I must have
found the camera was...

82
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,304
There?

83
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,056
Shit, was it?

84
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,642
God, is this even the right place?

85
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,770
Oh, Bora, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,021
What?

87
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,315
For what?

88
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,442
For when I slapped you.

89
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,945
Seriously?

90
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,447
It's fine!

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,200
Anyway, we're even now.

92
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm sorry, I really hated you then...

93
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:19,045
I thought that the reason my family
fell apart was all because of you.

94
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,011
I mean, even with
the hallucinations I had...

95
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,016
I thought that...
it was all because of you and your glue.

96
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
I also thought it was
because you gave me alcohol.

97
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,647
All this time. That wasn't true.

98
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,316
It wasn't.

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,720
What did they say to you back then?

100
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,310
You said the aliens said something to you.

101
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,314
What in the world did they say?

102
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,740
Is there anything else you can think of?
Anything before or after that?

103
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,242
My dad...

104
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,121
- What?
- Actually, my dad told me something.

105
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,294
Yeah, it was after I came back and...

106
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,921
I was in the hospital for a while.

107
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,508
And when I was there,
I remember him saying

108
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:52,138
that while I was in a daze,
I was rambling gibberish to myself.

109
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,722
Gibberish?

110
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,600
Do you think it's possible that...

111
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,228
that those ramblings might be
connected to...

112
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,648
...what I heard from the aliens?

113
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
Bora, let me use your phone.

114
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,686
Uh, hey... Dad, is that you?

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,272
Hey, Dad, it's Jihyo. Hmm...

116
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,443
Dad, will you pl... Ju... ju... Calm down.

117
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,364
No, I... Dad, stop.
Listen, I was going to call you, but I...

118
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,241
but I wasn't in a situation where...

119
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,744
Yes, well... Yeah, yeah, I'll go home.

120
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,205
Listen, I'm going home, but right now is...

121
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,747
What?

122
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,000
Say what?

123
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,812
<i>Give me...</i>

124
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,483
<i>- back my... boyfriend!
- </i>Hospitalization?

125
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
<i>You...</i>

126
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,279
No, I... I mean, why...

127
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,780
why is she acting like this?

128
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,031
And also, why here?

129
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,159
Well, she's exhibiting all
the signs of schizophrenia.

130
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,578
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

131
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,914
Paranoia, hallucinations, language
breakdown, et cetera.

132
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,166
- She's a textbook example.
<i>- Hey! Hey!</i>

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,336
This is Information we received
from the local police at the time.

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,523
- You're welcome to review it.
- So Ms. Hong did this?

135
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,675
I ask you find her as soon as possible
and take protective action.

136
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,636
As you can see, this is
a highly dangerous case of schizophrenia.

137
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,556
Yes, yes, I understand.

138
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,187
Hmm.

139
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,401
There's something fishy.

140
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,114
Things just really aren't matching up.

141
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,825
No. they're matching up too well.

142
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,076
Right.

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,579
Okay, let's say Jihyo was crazy
and went on a rampage.

144
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,873
Think about it.
Why would she do that here?

145
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,709
- Why way out here?
- I knew that person earlier.

146
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,086
Who?

147
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,172
The person Ms. Hong was holding onto.

148
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,343
He came with Ms. Hong to the station
because of an assault case.

149
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,345
An assault case?

150
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,428
Wait, Jihyo?

151
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,182
Yeah, he was also from that church.

152
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,898
I think even the police here are fishy.

153
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,445
Yes, Detective Kim here...

154
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,868
Yes. Sure thing.
I'll be right there, yeah.

155
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,346
Don't worry about this too much.

156
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,516
Trust me, we'll take care of it.
Everything's fine.

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,185
Please make certain of that.

158
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,831
Hey, Jihyo.

159
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,500
Stop right there.

160
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,583
What?

161
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,552
Don't go in.

162
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,635
Why?

163
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,180
Well, think about it. Isn't this timing...

164
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,599
just way too fucking perfect?

165
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,017
What is?

166
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,853
Why is he coming back right now?

167
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,021
As soon as you escaped from there?

168
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,859
Doesn't this seem
like some sort of trap?

169
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,237
Are you sure it was really your dad?

170
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,116
I'm sure. It was my dad's voice.

171
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
What if your dad is being held by them
as well?

172
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,508
Ah, shit, really?

173
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,427
Hey, wait!

174
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,011
Jihyo! Hold on!

175
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,721
Why?

176
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,181
Take this.

177
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,810
FOR OUTSIDE LIVE STREAM

178
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,687
Go on Discord. I'll be listening.

179
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,939
So if something happens, just scream.
Got it?

180
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,318
I'll be back.

181
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,555
Bora. I'm inside.

182
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,939
Dad...

183
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,232
Hello...

184
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,486
I'm home, Dad.

185
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,074
So, where is he?

186
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,243
Come in.

187
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,587
Hello.

188
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,388
Si...

189
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,556
Siguk.

190
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,937
Um...

191
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Uh...

192
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,201
My home...

193
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,286
It's gone.

194
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,045
Yes, thank you so much.
Actually...

195
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ORDER

196
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,883
I'm calling to see how the kidnapping case
at the New Hope Hospital is going?

197
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,550
Yes.

198
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,597
What? No, that can't be...

199
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,058
No, no, no, no.

200
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,269
Yesterday, the local station came
and searched the entire place.

201
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,939
I was the one who reported it.

202
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,774
No, how...

203
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,740
Yes, well, okay, I understand.
I get it. Okay.

204
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,829
What the...

205
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,627
I'm saying
this isn't a simple intimidation case.

206
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,088
So what does it have
to do with the church?

207
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,549
This... this person
did not need their help.

208
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,803
There were signs
that she was held there illegally.

209
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,166
What are you talking about? Huh?

210
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,974
They've already done an identity
confirmation and everything.

211
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,475
It was all legitimate!

212
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,854
What?

213
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,065
Motherfuckers.

214
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,776
So, about this cult.

215
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,949
I think it's possible they're manipulating
the police from the inside as well.

216
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
How did I see that with my own eyes,
and even report it,

217
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,662
only for them to cover it up like this?

218
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,830
They're not covering it up!

219
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,998
- You rookie!
- Shh.

220
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,835
Some crazy patients had an outburst
and you're misinterpreting it!

221
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,545
- That's it!
- Chief, it's not true!

222
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,797
Why did you go to Jeonju
in the first place?

223
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,675
It's like I said, it's a little personal...

224
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,510
- Can't tell you.
- Oh my God, rookie.

225
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,263
Instead of looking into
an old case like that, just...

226
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,598
just focus on <i>our</i> work!

227
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,436
Our work, rookie! Huh?
We're slammed, it's time to crack down!

228
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,276
And anyway, the case you reported
is within Jeonju's jurisdiction.

229
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,487
They'll take care of it there.
Don't think about it.

230
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,575
- This rookie.<i>
- Get back to work, seriously.</i> -

231
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,457
You little...

232
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,840
This member advanced
from a private to a corporal...

233
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,693
MOONHOLE TV FORUM
MOONHOLE... YOUTUBE... UPLOAD

234
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
...while waiting for Moonhole's
next video.

235
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,222
No. Mmm. You're overexaggerating.

236
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,426
- Blocked.
- Did she lose subscribers?

237
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,144
I feel like I'm looking
at last year's Bitcoin crash.

238
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,106
What's the point
of editing her videos?

239
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,859
- Move.
- The YouTuber herself went off the grid.

240
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,879
She's probably alive, right?

241
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,903
I think so.

242
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,406
Seeing that she's reading the group chat.

243
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,242
No, not Bora... Petite.

244
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,665
You don't, like, think she's dead, do you?

245
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,587
Gah! Ah, shit!

246
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,465
They're so strong, that bastard, fuck.

247
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,220
Cap, I'll take
an iced caramel macchiato.

248
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,481
Where on Earth have you been?

249
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,608
Ah, my ears! Fuck!

250
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,944
What? I told you I was going out.

251
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,707
You said you were going to buy cigarettes.

252
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,989
Was the convenience store in...
New Zealand?

253
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,473
So what happened? Did you find her?

254
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
Find who?

255
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,787
Weren't you going around
looking for Petite by yourself?

256
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,958
You left us behind because you thought
we'd be in danger, you punk. Didn't you?

257
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,888
Why the hell are you crying, you idiot?

258
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
I was really worried for her.

259
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,935
- You were worried?
- Gosh.

260
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,688
It's all right, it's all right.

261
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,731
She's back now.

262
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,900
Shhh.

263
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,235
It's okay.

264
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,572
He looks like a criminal,
but he's really sensitive.

265
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,658
<i>An alien implant?</i>

266
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,868
In Troll's head?

267
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,951
Mm-hm.

268
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,496
An alien implant? Oh no.

269
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,547
That has been reported among
people who were kidnapped by aliens.

270
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,967
Mysterious implants kinda like electronic
chips are planted inside their heads.

271
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,219
There are no scars, and no pain.

272
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,679
Can't even see where they did it.

273
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,556
It happened to Back Yoonsun as well.

274
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,351
Wait a minute, the same sort of chip
was implanted in Petite's head too?

275
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,061
- Yeah, she had one.
- Whoa.

276
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,897
- Hmm.
- But the cult took it out.

277
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,860
- Hmm. How'd they take it out?
- Wow.

278
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
A drill.

279
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,278
- Reeee! Eeeeh!
- Ah, hell, no.

280
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,699
In my opinion, the important thing is not
how they took it, but why they took it.

281
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,162
I mean, what is it about this chip that
they would name her a Messiah for it?

282
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,040
Well, they said
it's for salvation or whatever.

283
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,335
- Huh?
- Yeah, the cult leader said so.

284
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,921
He said it had something to do
with salvation or whatever.

285
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,924
Anyway, isn't all of this over now?

286
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,385
- You said Troll's boyfriend came back.
- So It's over?

287
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,556
Didn't this start because
she was trying to find that guy?

288
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,062
But if she found him, the cult,
the implant, and all that, it's all over.

289
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,398
Oh!

290
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,820
Going to the store?

291
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,491
Fuck you!

292
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,660
Why'd you turn off your fucking phone?

293
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,454
Wait, are you the owner of this place?

294
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,682
If you're going somewhere,
you should at least tell me.

295
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,459
Is it too much to ask to send a text?
Do you wanna die?

296
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,711
Are there any rooms available?

297
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,547
What? A customer?

298
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,424
This café doesn't have any.

299
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,468
Come on. What, cat got your tongue?

300
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,655
- Don't just stand there, say something!
- Right now, I...

301
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,347
Huh? Yeah, that's him.

302
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,057
It's Direct Kim.

303
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,184
- What?
- It's Direct Kim?

304
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,811
Right now...

305
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,795
Ah, hey! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

306
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,363
Daddy's sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Younggi. Daddy's sorry.

307
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,591
- Hey, what's going on?
- Please come help me grab her!

308
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,950
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's going on?

309
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,452
- What's going on?
- Here! Help me, help me! Come on!

310
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,037
Here, here...

311
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,332
Careful, careful, careful. Younggi! Lift.

312
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,167
- Ah! Ohhh!
- Oh, oh!

313
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,051
- Carefully, carefully!
- Oh my God.

314
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,686
- Aaah!
- The shotgun girl! Shotgun girl!

315
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,839
- It's okay.
- Huh?

316
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,482
- The shotgun girl!
- Oh! Oh!

317
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,093
- Oh, fuck, the shotgun girl!
- Help me!

318
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,469
- What's going on?
- Aah!

319
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,804
- Wow...
- Are you serious?

320
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,055
Wow, wow. Oh!

321
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,141
- Unbelievable...
- Damn it.

322
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,102
Oh... Oh...

323
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,317
Did you get some rest?

324
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,281
Yeah, you should have breakfast,
huh?

325
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,700
McDonald's breakfast!

326
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,662
Yeah, you used to say you wanted
to eat this every day when you were...

327
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,999
Are you happy you made
a fool out of the church?

328
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,085
And tell me, just how long
have you been a rat in our church?

329
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,220
Isn't talking to your dad like that
going a little too far?

330
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,015
What a nice father-daughter
relationship you two have, fuck!

331
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,685
Hey. Are you sure it's her who shot you?

332
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,145
I'm positive.

333
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,148
Defamation of character
and abuse on top of that.

334
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,149
Direct Kim's
daughter's in a cult.

335
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,232
What a funny prank.

336
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:41,943
Wait.

337
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,862
When were you going to tell us about this?

338
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:48,367
The whole reason you wanted to get into
the NPC or whatever was because of this?

339
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,535
That was the only option I had...

340
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,080
if I wanted to see her face again.

341
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,791
So you've been lying to us
this whole time, huh?

342
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,354
You said your daughter was kidnapped.

343
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,294
I'm really sorry.

344
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,297
Oh! I don't have time for this! Come on...

345
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,383
Tell me, where is her Holiness?

346
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,467
Her what?

347
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,427
Who? You mean Jihyo?

348
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,555
She's been talking about
"Her Holiness" since earlier.

349
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,099
She really wants to meet Jihyo.

350
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,182
Why?

351
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,563
Bora, come here.

352
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,898
- Why?
- Just a second.

353
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,609
Why?

354
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,698
Listen. Please do me a favor.
Let us stay here for just a little while.

355
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,699
Wait, what?

356
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,011
It's because I don't have anywhere
to take her right now.

357
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,453
The church knows my address.

358
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,288
No! No, no, no, no!

359
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,543
Oh no. No. No way!

360
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,712
Mr. Direct Kim.
What's one reason we should do that?

361
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,797
There isn't one.

362
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,675
There are a lot of people who almost
got killed by those crazy people.

363
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,886
- Exactly.
- You played a part in that.

364
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,096
What?

365
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,475
Well, they ended up like that
because they listened to you.

366
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,648
Bora.

367
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,983
Please help me.

368
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,402
I helped you, right? Huh?

369
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,319
You and Jihyo.

370
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,157
Hey, sir...

371
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,455
See, I'm the owner here.

372
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,956
Not her.

373
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,419
- I'm... I'm just saying.
- How about 150 per night?

374
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,756
Let me check the second floor boiler room.

375
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,842
What? The boiler room!

376
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,303
They need hot water.

377
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,931
No, come on! Send them away!

378
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,135
Hey, give me 10,000 won.

379
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,486
No matter what the situation might be,

380
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:51,198
food always comes first,
especially for Koreans, hm?

381
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,783
After you're done,
just leave the table out.

382
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,119
Hey, thank you, Dad.

383
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,007
Siguk...

384
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,384
Are you all right? Hey.

385
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,933
What in the world happened to you?

386
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,976
Do you know where Chao Phraya River is?

387
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
What?

388
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,147
They said I jumped from there,
from some bridge.

389
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,608
They said you jumped?
Wait, what do you mean?

390
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,986
Well, apparently, I tried killing myself...

391
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,488
What?

392
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,241
I opened my eyes and I was in a hospital.

393
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,492
A Thai hospital.

394
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,577
I listened to what they said...

395
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,373
fell asleep, woke up,

396
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,334
fell asleep, woke up again,
I was at Incheon Airport.

397
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,588
But why Thailand all of a sudden?

398
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,550
I really don't like food with cilantro.

399
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,176
Wait, so you...

400
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,720
Wait, hold on, Siguk.

401
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,850
So then you...

402
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,895
don't remember anything
at all that happened to you?

403
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,231
What's the last thing you remember?

404
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,401
When you asked me to break up with you.

405
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:17,158
I remember, before going to the bar,
I gave some food to Justin Bieber.

406
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,620
What happened to Justin Bieber?

407
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,248
I nee... need to clean his litter box.

408
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,874
Oh! That guy!

409
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,814
Tell Siguk
he can stay here for a while.

410
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,484
I can sleep in the living room.

411
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,694
Mmm. Thank you.

412
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,074
We should at least do this for him.
What else can we do?

413
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,477
<i>This is one extraordinary...</i>

414
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,203
Because of my kid,
he packed up everything

415
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,871
and tried to kill himself.

416
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,207
<i>...about 60 or 70 years.</i>

417
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,958
<i>The aging process...</i>

418
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,211
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

419
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:56,007
Do you remember that time...
when I went missing in middle school?

420
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,095
<i>The sturgeon, which takes a long time
to reach its full strength...</i>

421
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,806
You said that I kept saying weird things
at the hospital.

422
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,974
What type of things did I say?

423
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,311
- Why are you suddenly asking me that?
- It's just...

424
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,939
Do you remember anything I said?

425
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,065
No, I don't remember.

426
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,608
Nor do I want to.

427
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,738
Tell me, why are you talking nonsense
all of a sudden? My God.

428
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,366
Please, just let it be.

429
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,993
<i>...of the species to endangered status.</i>

430
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,454
<i>There are people who rescue
the sturgeon from danger</i>

431
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,332
<i>so that it can fully grow,
which takes time.</i>

432
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,585
<i>The migration
for this fascinating creature follows...</i>

433
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,546
He can wear some of Dad's things for now.

434
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,631
Tell him to let us know
if he needs anything.

435
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,675
He's going to have to start from scratch.

436
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,759
All right.

437
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,387
So...

438
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,181
what's going on?

439
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,519
Sorry? What do you mean?

440
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,730
You've been like that
since you were young.

441
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,776
When you have something on your mind,
you avoid eye contact

442
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,362
and sneak around
like you're guilty of something.

443
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,072
- Uh...
- So what is it?

444
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,866
Uh...

445
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,368
It's because of Siguk.

446
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,037
You were like that before he disappeared.

447
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,542
Is it uncomfortable to talk to me?

448
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,005
Is it something
you'd rather solve on your own?

449
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,675
Uh...

450
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,680
Siguk...

451
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,186
See, I really don't think
Siguk tried to kill himself, so...

452
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,730
What do you mean?

453
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,233
It's nothing. Just...

454
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,153
- Thank you.
- What is it?

455
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,239
It's really nothing. I'm sorry.

456
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,118
I'm the one who heard it.
I heard you rambling.

457
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,623
What?

458
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,295
I was the first one to arrive
at the hospital after getting the call.

459
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,049
When I got there, you were asleep
and mumbling something.

460
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,134
Like you were in a trance.

461
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
I just thought it was because of the glue.

462
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,099
Do you remember what I said?

463
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,521
Do you remember
exactly what I said that day?

464
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,313
I do...

465
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,652
You just kept saying
the same thing over and over.

466
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,986
Tell me...

467
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,739
Please tell me what was I saying that day.

468
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,746
"Come back.<i>"</i>

469
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,288
Wait, what?

470
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,916
<i>"Come back to me.</i>"

471
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,503
What are you saying?
You want me to come now?

472
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:42,757
No, I mean, she said that's what
I kept repeating at the hospital.

473
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,469
"Coming back... back to me."

474
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,470
<i>Coming back? Who is?</i>

475
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
What do you mean, who? The aliens!

476
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,266
Why are they coming back?

477
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,936
I don't know for sure, but I think
the thing they implanted in my head...

478
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,273
I think that it must have
something to do with that.

479
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,526
<i>Bora...</i>

480
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,155
Do you think it could be some sort
of device that calls for the UFOs, huh?

481
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,741
<i>A transmitter?</i>

482
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,785
<i>Like a pager.</i>

483
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,453
Ugh, I'm not eating that!

484
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,537
Huh?

485
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,708
What? What was that? What happened?

486
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,792
Just eat it.

487
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,645
- No, nothing.
- I'm not eating that!

488
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,712
Well, so now what?

489
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,922
<i>- What do you wanna do?</i>
- Uh, well...

490
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,174
I guess I'll come over there...

491
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,978
<i>- Yeah, I'll come there first...</i>
- You don't need to because of that.

492
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,221
<i>That's just a theory you have.</i>

493
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,349
Don't you need
to take care of your boyfriend?

494
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,019
Just stay at home for a while.
And don't go anywhere.

495
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,102
No...

496
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,148
- Wait, no, Bo... Just listen...
<i>- You've finally found him.</i>

497
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,109
<i>You need to keep an eye on him
so he doesn't run off somewhere.</i>

498
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,053
<i>No, no, Bora, but this is still...</i>

499
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,614
I'm sorry, but I have something to do.
I gotta go.

500
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,160
Bo... Bo... Bora!

501
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,082
Huh?

502
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,340
Lee Siguk.

503
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,930
Where are you going?

504
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,890
Ah, do you need something?

505
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,892
Can I help you?

506
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,937
I have to go somewhere.

507
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
Where?

508
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,192
Um, you should stay home for now.

509
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,401
Wanna go?

510
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,829
Why do you keep asking for "Her Holiness"?

511
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,333
Can she summon a UFO or something?

512
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,794
Tell me... Is that it?

513
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,129
Where on Earth did you get that idea?

514
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,840
The thing that you guys
took out of Jihyo's head,

515
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,134
is that some kind of transmitter?

516
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:54,472
You summon them, and the aliens come down,
and what happens next?

517
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,936
What is this "Messiah"
supposed to be doing?

518
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,230
I looked over this a bit,
and it's not in here either.

519
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,817
There's only
"Messiah shows up to save mankind."

520
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,360
There's nothing written after that.

521
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,240
So what is it?
What does this "Messiah" do?

522
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,284
Bora, what are you doing?

523
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,745
Hold on. I'm talking to her right now.

524
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,540
What are you going to gain from talking
about this damn cult?

525
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,875
- She's already confused.
- Shut up!

526
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,795
Do you even know anything
about our doctrines?

527
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,257
How dare you talk
to your dad like that!

528
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,051
Tell me, when were you ever a dad to me?
What do you mean, "dad"?

529
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,470
- Agh!
- You punk! What did you just say to me?

530
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,157
- They're getting on better.
- We've nothing to talk about.

531
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,861
Do you know what I've done because of you?

532
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,520
- Well I never asked you to do that!
- Oh, will both of you just shut up?

533
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,941
You.

534
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,819
Listen, If you don't start talking,
you're out of here.

535
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,781
I won't ever let you meet "Her Holiness"
or whatever again. So speak up.

536
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
I'll kick you out too!

537
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,126
Okay, I got it.

538
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,335
I'll call Cap now.

539
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,174
No, I... Bora, come on.
Why are you being like that?

540
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,384
- I have to tell her.
- Huh?

541
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,637
I need to tell her Holiness...

542
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,433
that she needs to run away.

543
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,312
What are you talking about?

544
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,231
The Corps is desperately
trying to find her.

545
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,610
And when they do, they'll kill her.

546
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,201
Hello?

547
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,370
All of the believers
think that the Messiah...

548
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
Well, they think she's already dead, and...

549
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,751
that she threw away her body,

550
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,336
- that she was martyred.
- Hmm.

551
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,135
This person is the victim.

552
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,888
And we're in a hurry
to find out where this person is.

553
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,016
It's not confirmed
whether he's alive or not.

554
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,270
Tell me, is it true you've
been in touch with Ms. Hong Jihyo?

555
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,440
No... We haven't.

556
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,112
After she left home, she... she hasn't
answered any of our phone calls.

557
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,156
I'm afraid her Holiness's
funeral will be held soon.

558
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,535
Are they really trying to murder her?

559
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
They do that, their lie seems true.

560
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,789
The believers,

561
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,375
they're going...

562
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,877
They're going to display her dead body...

563
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,048
DETECTIVE OH YOUNGTAEK
JEONJU JEONWON POLICE STATION

564
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,426
- Contact me on my cell phone.
- Rural police station? You're not local?

565
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,720
This violent incident occurred
in our jurisdiction.

566
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,598
If things get worse,
I'm sure local police will get involved.

567
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,350
And after the funeral ceremony,

568
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,353
Father will take
the Messiah's divine power

569
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,605
and use it in her place.

570
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,319
What? What power?

571
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:58,947
Ascension.

572
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,491
What?

573
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,036
But you see, the only one
that can give the power of ascension

574
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,621
to the people of the Earth...

575
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,085
Well, it can only be the Messiah herself.

576
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,462
Not Father.

577
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,510
Don't you understand?

578
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,681
Don't you understand? Father Light
will be coming down to Earth very soon.

579
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,851
What the hell were you thinking?
He's coming soon, Sister Seo!

580
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,062
Weren't you embarrassed
acting like that in front of them? Huh?

581
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,024
Still so obsessed?
Obsessed with worldly desire...

582
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,818
- What? What are you gonna do now? Huh?
- Brother Oh, but...

583
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,279
- It's not that...
- You shut your mouth!

584
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,572
We didn't say you could speak!

585
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,365
For someone who is a deaconess,

586
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,701
I don't understand
how you could think so childishly.

587
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,369
Appeasing her like that.

588
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,581
So, what, did you think
you'd get greater salvation?

589
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,251
It's a good thing, huh?
She did it after the surgery. She's lucky.

590
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,688
- It could have caused a bigger problem.
- Oh God...

591
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,173
She should be expelled,
so she won't be saved.

592
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,135
Goodness...
You guys are being too serious

593
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,846
over a deaconess causing a little trouble.

594
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,972
So? Hmm.

595
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,396
So let's wrap all this up.

596
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,567
The Father is making a decision.

597
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,328
Get on your feet.

598
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,007
The sinner must await judgment.

599
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,942
If you die alone now,

600
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,236
you'll be so lonely.

601
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,697
You should really go.

602
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,449
You should leave.

603
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,664
Everything now is...

604
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,958
trivial, anyway.

605
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,919
Hmm?

606
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,137
You know what?

607
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,141
- Father!
- I've been in a great mood these days.

608
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,185
- Everyone looks... so small.
- Father!

609
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,564
Before, I used to hate it,
hate it so much,

610
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,901
the way... they struggled to live.

611
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,905
- Father!
- Nowadays, they look adorable.

612
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>Sella.</i>

613
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,825
I was wrong.

614
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,969
<i>- Sella.</i>
- Father!

615
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,203
Father has generously forgiven you.

616
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,247
Thank you, I'm sorry...

617
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,916
The trial is over.

618
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,383
Father, I didn't do it on purpose.

619
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,644
I didn't know this would happen.

620
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,816
- Get up.
- Come on, get up.

621
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,611
- Oh, my...
- Let's go outside, come on.

622
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,447
Oh! I thought I was gonna die!

623
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,078
<i>Father, the memorial invitation
is ready to be sent.</i>

624
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,996
Oh, you're working so hard.

625
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,165
Uh... Okay, good.

626
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,210
And how's the tech team?
Is everything ready?

627
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,795
<i>Sorry, Father.</i>

628
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,465
<i>They say they need a little more time
to get things ready. What should we do?</i>

629
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,548
Hmm.

630
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,053
And make our believers wait even longer?
No.

631
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,764
Tell them to make it on time.

632
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,267
<i>Okay, understood. Light be with you.</i>

633
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,564
Don't worry.

634
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,608
Everything's going to be okay.

635
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,571
Justin!

636
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,409
Justin, I'm here. Where are you, Justin?

637
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,412
Justin!

638
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,375
Justin, where are you, buddy?

639
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,459
Justin...

640
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,921
Listen, he's not here.

641
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,339
I've already looked for him.

642
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,258
I think someone took him.

643
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,844
Who would take that grubby cat anyway?

644
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,557
Justin. Justin...

645
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,357
He must be hungry.

646
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,455
- Let's go home.
- I don't have a home.

647
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,500
- Don't be like that.
- What about Justin?

648
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,919
I looked for him already.

649
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,005
What were you going to do
when you found him?

650
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,092
Were you gonna take care of him?
Your mom hates animals.

651
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,724
I don't know,
I just tried looking for him.

652
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,226
Did you just try looking for me, too?

653
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,358
If you'd found me, then what?

654
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,777
Didn't we break up anyway?

655
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm sorry.

656
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,914
I knew everything.

657
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,585
I knew you felt pressured
when I talked about living together.

658
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,671
I noticed it from the signals
you gave me from the beginning.

659
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,841
I knew it, but I just kept pushing anyway.

660
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,805
If I hadn't brought it up that day, you
might not have broken up with me. Damn it.

661
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,933
Siguk...

662
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,269
But things
didn't go as planned, so I...

663
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,731
I did something as stupid
as trying to kill myself.

664
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,734
How can a person be so idiotic? Oh...

665
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:12,905
- Why did I even work so hard all my life?
- Come on. It's not your fault!

666
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,199
Hey, Lee Siguk.

667
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,243
Think hard for a second, hm?

668
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,578
Are you really sure you did that? Huh?

669
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,289
I mean, tell me the truth,
did you really try to die?

670
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,417
You cleared everything out of your room
and put it up for rent.

671
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,295
You bought a plane ticket!
Did your really do all that? Huh?

672
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,214
If not me, then who?

673
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,593
I think that it really
doesn't add up at all, huh?

674
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,429
Huh? Do you really
think that's what happened?

675
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,306
I just don't know.

676
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,011
LOVELY AUNT, ARE YOU WATCHING?
DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS? LOL

677
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,820
UFO FORUM MODS

678
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,831
Yes, ma'am.
I'm checking her known places now.

679
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,042
Hmm. We should be able to find her today.
Don't worry about it too much.

680
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,886
<i>Don't tell me
not to worry.</i>

681
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,963
<i>We have to find her by the end of the day.</i>

682
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,840
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

683
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,927
Her location just came up.
I'll send it to you right away.

684
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,848
You can take care of the rest.
I'll stand down for now.

685
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,891
<i>Yes, understood.</i>

686
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,102
Ascension...

687
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,456
Hey. Do you think you get a superpower?

688
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,109
The ability to fly would be cool.
Like growing, pfft, wings.

689
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,694
I wanna teleport.

690
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,987
Phswoo!

691
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,407
Trust me, it's not that great.
The ascension they're talking about?

692
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,117
Huh?

693
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,661
You know,
what those cultists call ascension,

694
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,003
it's much different
than what you're thinking.

695
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,542
They just get together and
commit pointless crimes. Okay?

696
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,043
Forget it.

697
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,547
Those cultists are planning
something at Jihyo's funeral...

698
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,715
Jihyo's funeral?

699
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,052
- Oh!
- Hi!

700
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,055
My funeral?

701
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,599
What are you talking about?

702
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,309
Your Holiness.

703
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,065
- Damn it.
- Oh shit!

704
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,584
- Wait! Hey!
- Get off...

705
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,736
What the hell are you guys?
It's you, isn't it? You kidnapped Siguk.

706
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,821
- Calm down!
- Do you even know how broken...

707
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,448
how completely broken Siguk is now?

708
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,575
- Come on let her go!
- You made him into an invalid!

709
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,329
Then you throw him out like trash?
Huh? What is this? Huh?

710
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,706
What did you take out of my head?

711
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,510
- Hey! Calm down!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

712
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,919
Just calm down, calm down!

713
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,760
So she's Direct Kim's daughter?

714
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,344
Huh?

715
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,266
So then, he was lying to us
this entire time?

716
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,938
She's... more useful than you might think.

717
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,275
If you ask nicely, she gives out
information. Why are you attacking her?

718
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,279
Bora. Tell me why we don't have
any evidence yet to show.

719
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,365
- What?
- About what we've done.

720
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,868
Aliens... and cult leaders,
and things like that...

721
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,122
It's just... You see, it sounds crazy
to people who hear it, huh?

722
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,166
Even though we've worked
so hard this whole time,

723
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,292
there's no evidence.

724
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,295
Nobody will believe us
if we don't have any proof. Huh?

725
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,798
What's the point if nobody believes us?

726
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,551
Then isn't this whole thing for nothing?

727
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,513
Hey. Do you know what state
Siguk is in right now?

728
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,724
He doesn't even know what happened to him.

729
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,977
You don't know how it feels, do you? Huh?

730
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,312
You don't...

731
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,276
...understand... just how crazy
that makes people.

"Memorial."

735
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,431
FASTING THE DAY
BEFORE THE MEMORIAL SERVICE!

736
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,017
"Ascension is everlasting life
and salvation."

737
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,685
"We must abandon our carbon bodies

738
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,063
in order to receive
our everlasting body of Light."

739
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,107
These people...

740
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
think that...

741
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,404
this body is the root of all evil,

742
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,657
so they need to abandon it.

743
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,740
Wait, wait, wait.

744
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,245
Abandoning your carbon body?

745
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,248
So then... doesn't that mean death?

746
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,251
Then why'd
they take the implant?

747
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,922
I'm guessing that alien implants
are some kind of beacon or signal fire.

748
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
It must signal the target spot.

749
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,969
Then a fleet of UFOs appear,
and bang! Over!

750
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,512
Everyone dies.

751
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,514
Sounds like destruction, not ascension.

752
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,475
Holy shit, when did the scale of this
suddenly get so massive?

753
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,394
People believe this?

754
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,316
Hey, stop doing that!
Why are you shaking your legs?

755
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,442
I'm not shaking them.

756
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,613
It's mass suicide.

757
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:52,369
"Ascension" means mass suicide.
It's not the destruction of humanity.

758
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,620
What do you mean?

759
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,457
Well, It's not the first time
that they've done this.

760
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,919
In the past,
they went on about the "ascension,"

761
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,130
and as a group, they all hung themselves.

762
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,800
<i>They convinced people that removing
yourself from your body is ascension.</i>

763
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,845
<i>One of the people who hung
themselves at that time</i>

764
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,889
<i>was her grandmother.</i>

765
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,016
Sadly, she was there to see it.

766
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,017
Anyway...

767
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,813
if these trash people want
to get together and kill themselves.

768
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
just let them.

769
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,318
It's not the Messiah's funeral,
it's theirs.

770
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,159
<i>It has to do with all of us.</i>

771
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,578
Jihyo. Whatever's in your memory...

772
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,832
that...

773
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,668
...will bring salvation to us all.

774
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,879
It's there.

775
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,007
What?

776
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,636
The implant is gonna be there.

777
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,555
At my funeral.

778
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,682
With the cult leader.

779
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,101
And?

780
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,021
I've gotta find it.

781
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,105
What?

782
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:04,566
How?

783
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,903
Wait a second. Don't tell me you seriously
believe in the aliens or whatever.

784
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,115
Yes... I believe it.

785
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,827
I do believe it.
The aliens, or whatever it is.

786
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,080
There was an implant in my head.

787
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,082
And I lost it without any knowledge of it.

788
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,042
And I need that implant.

789
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,211
I'll find it, and get rid of it.

790
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,713
- Stop it. Don't be ridiculous.
- No, Bora, this is...

791
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,465
Oh please, just shut up for a second...

792
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,467
I know, I know, I know.
Bora, you don't get it!

793
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,719
This is happening because of me. Okay?

794
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,721
This all happened
because I lost the implant.

795
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,515
God, I have...

796
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,267
I have to go! No, you don't have to go.

797
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,771
You all don't have to go. Uh, really.
First of all, I... I have to go...

798
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,334
- I've gotta...
- I said knock it off!

799
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,862
Nobody go and do something
that might kill you,

800
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,781
unless you wanna die by my hands.

801
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,659
Wh... where are you going?

802
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,411
Cigarettes.

803
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,955
A memorial service?

804
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,833
- Wait, who died?
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

805
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,476
<i>But as of today, the worship service
and everything was canceled.</i>

806
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,089
How strange, I mean what kind of event
would make them close the church doors?

807
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,091
Do you think it could be
a break or something?

808
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,510
No, no, no, no.
Well, there was nothing in the church.

809
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,637
They got rid of furniture and everything.

810
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,558
<i>I mean, why does everything
they do seem so creepy, you know?</i>

811
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,352
<i>Anything else? That you found?</i>

812
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,773
<i>Hello?</i>

813
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,068
Sehee, I need to help someone
with a civil complaint.

814
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,195
- Okay, I'll call you back.
<i>- Talk to you later.</i>

815
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,539
You were here when Ms. Hong caused
a scene at the church, that right?

816
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,541
You're Ms. Hong's friend.

817
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,842
Open it. Use your computer.

818
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,488
Why is it so quiet here? Huh?
Where did everyone go?

819
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,324
Uh... because Bora's not back yet.

820
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,701
Phillip and Donghyuk already went home.

821
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,705
- And what about the owner?
- The gym.

822
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,208
- At a time like this?
- Mmm.

823
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,170
He's more afraid of muscle loss
than the destruction of mankind.

824
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,005
Hah!

825
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,101
Hey, Jihyo.

826
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
Yeah?

827
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,146
What are you doing here?

828
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,192
I'm smoking.

829
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,755
No, that's not what I meant.
You said your boyfriend came back.

830
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,281
He did.

831
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,368
But what are you still doing here?

832
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,412
Wasn't, your goal to find him
in the first place?

833
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,126
Hmm.

834
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,171
Uh, give me a cigarette too, would ya?

835
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,510
Here.

836
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,472
Whew, I don't know how long it's been
since I last smoked.

837
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,232
- See you inside.
- Okay.

838
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,834
Hey,

839
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,420
What?

840
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,048
About my funeral.
When's it happening?

841
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,218
I don't really know.

842
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,682
And what about the location?
Don't you know where it is?

843
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,642
Why are you asking me that?

844
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,897
Tell me. The...

845
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,566
the Messiah is asking you.

846
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,361
Se... seriously?

847
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,989
Why, are you gonna take it back?

848
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,072
Are you?

849
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,285
You're trying to regain
your divine power, right?

850
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,247
That's right.

851
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,540
Okay.

852
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,378
Well, I don't know the location.

853
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:41,676
But in the security team's group chat,
there should be an announcement.

854
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,053
Tell me, where's your phone at?

855
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,137
Uh...

856
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,473
Uh, well, he took it.

857
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,308
It's in the car.

858
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,146
The keys. Where are the keys?

859
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,975
Where the hell are they?

860
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,142
Where could they be?

861
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,397
Where are they? Huh?

862
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,190
Hold on. Oh!

863
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,111
Oh? I found them!

864
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,070
Huh?

865
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,957
Stay still!

866
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,546
Don't move.

867
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,925
I can't breathe!

868
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,806
Get off of me! Help me!

869
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,477
Help! Help me! Stop!

870
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,819
We've secured the Messiah's body.

871
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,196
We also have secured Sister Abigail. Over.

872
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,660
Uh...

873
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,287
Your Holiness!

874
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,086
Quickly. We have to go.

875
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,678
Younggi!

876
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,223
Huh? Younggi, don't go!

877
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,810
Younggi!

878
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,520
Younggi! Don't. Don't go!

879
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,344
- Mr. Kim!
- Younggi, Younggi...

880
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,607
You can't leave. You can't go.

881
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,402
- You can't go. Please...
- Uh-uh. We have to leave now!

882
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,196
Please, don't, Younggi.
Please don't leave.

883
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,281
Younggi! Don't leave me!

884
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,533
Younggi, don't!

885
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,118
Don't go...

886
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,078
Look out!

887
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,791
Younggi!

888
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,794
What should we do?

889
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,133
Watch out!,

890
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,684
You little shit.

891
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,195
Let's go. Let's go!

892
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,403
Yaaah!

893
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,915
What's going on?
Why is all this happening?

894
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,584
Captain Price.

895
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,756
Get out of here. More people are coming.

896
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,924
Huh?

897
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,140
Younggi...

898
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,645
Mm-hm.

899
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,899
Huh? No, no...

900
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,109
Don't go...

901
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,861
Please, take care of Mr. Kim.

902
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,321
Captain Price.

903
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,244
- I'm really sorry.
- What?

904
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,122
No. No. Wait, wait...

905
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,254
Captain Price.

906
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,716
- Thank you so much, really.
- What?

907
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,887
Please tell everyone else
I said that, too.

908
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,055
Wait...

909
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,567
Hurry up! Let's go!

910
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,739
No. Petite...

911
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,823
Petite...

912
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,742
Hold on, where... where are you going?

913
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,244
Wait, where are you going?
