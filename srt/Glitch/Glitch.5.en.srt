1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,426
"It was 1976,

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,096
and 12 lights flashed and moved
extremely slow in the sky of Seoul."

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,559
"According to witnesses, it looked like
the lights were headed exactly to Namsan."

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,322
BACK YOONSUN'S ACCOUNT OF THE ATTEMPTED
SHOOT DOWN OF A UFO IN SEOUL

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,190
"After, many people who claimed to have
experienced mysterious events showed up,

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,193
leading to the suspicion
that they were UFO lights."

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,363
"One of those people was Ms. Back,
a college student,

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,909
who on her way home from her art class
was allegedly kidnapped by aliens."

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:39,122
"After the incident, she claimed
that aliens inserted a chip in her brain

10
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,917
and that she can communicate
with them using the chip on occasion."

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,298
And where is she now or what does she do?

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:53,136
"Nobody knows her whereabouts
or whether or not she is still alive."

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,804
Come on, Jihyo.

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,433
Why are you so obsessed with an event
that happened over 30 years ago?

15
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:03,396
- What would you do if you found a UFO?
- It's just... so frustrating for me.

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,942
Obviously, something's out there,
that's why these stories keep coming out.

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,821
I wish... I could witness it
with my very own eyes.

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
I'm really curious.

19
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,078
Now look! To be a witness.

20
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,915
It's what you want. A UFO formation.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Wow!

22
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,217
It looks exactly the same! It is amazing!

23
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,681
How did you come up with this idea?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,014
- Bora.
- Yeah?

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,350
Do you think aliens really came to Korea?

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,021
And now breathe.

27
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,189
One.

28
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,272
Two.

29
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,774
Three.

30
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,527
Four.

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,528
Five.

32
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,197
All right, next position is Garudasana.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,952
As you breathe in, lift your right leg
and cross it over the left.

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:10,880
Help me!

35
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,340
Oh, my God!

36
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,716
What?

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,427
No! No! Call the police now!

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,391
- Call them!
- Please come with me.

39
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,182
- Do something, please!
- Ow! Let go!

40
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,652
- Hey...
- Why is he here?

41
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,821
- What is he doing?
- Oh my God. Such a creep.

42
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,799
- What is he doing? He's still in shoes.
- Uh... uh...

43
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,032
- What is going on?
- Shoes!

44
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,367
Oh. Uh...

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,288
- What are you doing? Huh?
- You can't come in here.

46
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,371
- Get out! You can't come in here.
- Excuse me. Oh.

47
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,168
Excuse me. Ow!

48
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,390
Please, we have to leave!
You have to come out right now!

49
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,510
- Huh? Call the cops! Call the cops!
- Ju... just a sec. No!

50
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,431
- I swear I'm not a psychopath.
- Hm.

51
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,391
Uh, first of all, I'm sorry, but there's...

52
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,227
I apologize, there's been
a slight misunderstanding.

53
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,164
- I'll solve it soon.
- What is he talking about?

54
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,065
- I promise this won't take much longer.
- You're not fooling anyone!

55
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,692
That bastard right there is a weirdo!

56
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,444
A fanatic! He's a fanatic!

57
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,404
I promise you, I'm not.

58
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,698
- He's a psycho!
- All the psychopaths speak like that!

59
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,783
Hey, ladies! I bet you didn't know.

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,679
- On the next floor is a bizarre church!
- I don't believe in that church.

61
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,263
- What are they talking...
- Actually...

62
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,349
- What church?
- The floor upstairs?

63
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,000
- Right above us!
- I'm a Catholic man.

64
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,753
That's bullshit!
How were you baptized?

65
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,463
Thomas...

66
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,050
So, Thomas, why would you go
upstairs to that weirdo's church?

67
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,434
'Cause I'm trying to find my daughter.

68
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,979
And you came here to film me, didn't you?

69
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,651
I saw the title of your broadcast.

70
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,653
The content you create

71
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,072
is about me.

72
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,660
Then make a post.

73
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:05,995
What?

74
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,040
Open the Direct Kim blog right now
and then post something.

75
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,417
I'll believe you
if you verify your identity.

76
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,047
What? Forgot the password?
Come on, something like that?

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,495
BLOG - DIRECT KIM
POSTING

78
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,966
What kind of house is this?

79
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,094
Ugh... there's nothing in this place.

80
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,852
I thought there were gonna be pictures
and maps and things like that

81
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,312
spread out all over the walls.

82
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,356
Like some psycho detective or something.

83
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,570
- Please ask something.
- Huh?

84
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,157
You wanted to meet me, didn't you?
You have things to ask me, so ask now.

85
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,367
Oh. Uh...

86
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,662
Hm... Your...

87
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,831
Your wife and son. Where are they?

88
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,207
In New Zealand.

89
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,127
Oh! They live abroad...

90
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,795
You must be very busy.

91
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,256
You have to send them money
and live a religious life.

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,176
How long have you been doing
cosplay with a cultist turn?

93
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,801
Four years.

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,350
Have you found something useful
on your daughter's whereabouts?

95
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,809
- I haven't.
- Huh?

96
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,645
I haven't found anything useful.

97
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,856
I don't know where she is
or what happened.

98
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,567
Oh. So then...

99
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,446
what information have you discovered
about the cult in question?

100
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,866
- Did you discover their true identity?
- I don't understand what you mean by that.

101
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,242
They're a cultist church.

102
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,495
You should know that already.
You saw it yourself.

103
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,331
- Why do you ask me?
- You really think I don't know it?

104
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,542
What did you wanna meet me for?
What do you want to know, huh?

105
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm not even fully awake,
and you're asking many questions.

106
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,464
So tell me...

107
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,052
How can a human being levitate?

108
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,594
What?

109
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,984
I saw this at the place my boyfriend
last visited before he disappeared.

110
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,279
But I don't think it's possible
for a human being to do that.

111
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:54,080
Mr. Direct Kim, I need you
to tell me if aliens really exist.

112
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,748
And if they do...

113
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,918
how are they connected to that church?

114
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,256
It's way too early for this.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,967
How can you ask
such a ridiculous question?

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,215
SERGEANT KIM BYUNGJO
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ORDER

117
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,884
"Department of Public Order"?

118
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,247
- Ow!
- The door's open.

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,293
Who are you?

120
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,631
Good evening, ma'am!
Kim Byungjo. I'm a detective.

121
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,216
Okay.

122
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm not...

123
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,761
gonna cooperate.

124
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,388
Huh? Wh... why not?

125
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,472
Hey, ma'am!

126
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,516
Sorry...

127
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,686
Do you remember
Hope and Light Assisted Living?

128
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,190
It's a case that was yours
when you were an officer.

129
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,608
The mass suicide case.

130
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
Ugh. Ma'am,
I don't need much of your time.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,031
I just want to ask you
a few simple questions about that case.

132
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,114
Hey!

133
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,912
I don't like talking to the police. Go.

134
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,538
Okay, but...

135
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,791
Where are you going to?
I'll give you a ride.

136
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,793
We can talk on the way, huh?

137
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,629
Wait... Just three minutes! Two minutes!

138
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,714
Just one minute! May I pay for the tax...

139
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,347
What the hell?

140
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,895
- Yes, Kim Byungjo spe...
<i>- Kim Byungjo's phone, right?</i>

141
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,565
- It's me, but who's...
<i>- I was hoping we could meet and talk.</i>

142
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,108
<i>- Is lunchtime good for you?</i>
- Wait.

143
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,361
- Can you tell me who's calling, please?
<i>- You know Jihyo, right? Hong Jihyo.</i>

144
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,445
Huh?

145
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,323
The Newbeginnings Peace Corps?

146
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,950
Yeah, NPC is the abbreviation.

147
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,577
- NPC?
- NPC.

148
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,911
And who are those guys?

149
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,749
A group of young volunteers
from Divine Light Church.

150
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,752
My plan is to join that group.

151
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,588
Why would you wanna do that?

152
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,842
To find my daughter.

153
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,677
But I don't understand

154
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,931
What does finding your daughter have
to do with the NPC thing or whatever?

155
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,184
I'm gonna need much more.
Explain the connection.

156
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,186
I think...

157
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,648
they kidnapped my daughter or something.

158
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,816
Come again?

159
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,486
Kidnapped girl... by the NPC?

160
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,780
Why?

161
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,366
- Is there any evidence of this?
- Of course not.

162
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,535
- Why do you think such thing?
- Because I do.

163
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,746
I believe you have a shitty plan, sir.

164
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,292
Ugh! Upsetting little man!

165
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,503
Shit, man!
You're more frustrating than Jihyo!

166
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,380
I mean...

167
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,883
No, please. You're better at this.

168
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,384
You've gotta be eloquent.

169
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,347
Now just explain this more clearly!

170
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,558
Explain to me exactly,
what did these people do?

171
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,060
Why are these guys your suspects?

172
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,730
- Huh? Did they really kidnap some...
- Honestly, I have no idea either!

173
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,690
That's why I'm stuck like this now!

174
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,696
As for their activities,

175
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,990
even within that church,
they keep it secret.

176
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,243
There's no way to
track out their activities.

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,288
The only way is getting accepted
as a member of their group.

178
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,123
And at the moment,

179
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,417
the NPC is suspicious.

180
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,210
And that's all.

181
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,421
Is that really all? Huh?

182
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,138
So, sir... what did you do
during those four years?

183
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,184
Do I really need to remind you that your
daughter's life is probably on the line?

184
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,479
Shouldn't you capture that woman selling
houses and do something terrible to her?

185
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,232
Stop saying things like that.
You just don't know the whole story.

186
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,858
If four years passed, she's already...

187
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,320
She's already what?

188
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,280
You think she's dead?

189
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,907
Now, listen...

190
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,703
She's my daughter

191
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,208
Mark my words, we can't trust that man.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,920
But I can't know for sure
which part of his story's a lie.

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,385
Always the ones who look really innocent
are actually insidious on the inside.

194
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,643
Hey.

195
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,939
- Huh?
- Your boyfriend isn't dead.

196
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,234
It was just a minor slip of the tongue.

197
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,070
He's not dead and I know that for sure.

198
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,364
Thank you.

199
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,579
But that's not really
why I'm acting like this.

200
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,247
Then why?

201
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,377
Bora...

202
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,880
I think that now I've lost my mind.

203
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,592
You're starting to freak me out.
What's up?

204
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,615
Yeah, I think that you are crazy!

205
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,327
I know, that's what I'm saying. I don't
know what I was thinking, or why I did it.

206
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,703
Hey!

207
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,550
- Stay right there, damn it!
- Hurry!

208
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,834
- Come!
- Stop!

209
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,919
Quickly!

210
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,338
- Hey!
- Go!

211
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,342
Hey! No!

212
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,010
- Please!
- We'll bring it back!

213
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,261
When this is all over!

214
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,096
I'm really sorry, sir.

215
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,391
Whoo!

216
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,270
Oh my God!

217
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,315
- Hey, bitch! You're seriously crazy!
- Whoo!

218
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,370
Is this Direct Kim's
external hard drive?

219
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,913
I think that he collected...

220
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,668
every photo the cult members posted
on the chats and social media.

221
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,462
- Why?
- Man, I have no fucking idea.

222
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,464
He thought these could be evidence.

223
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:08,013
No wonder he hasn't found
his daughter, doing stuff like this.

224
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,935
Let's open the next folder...

225
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,437
Sister Hwajung's chat.

226
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,065
Pork belly?

227
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,419
I'm really sorry.

228
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,153
I promise next time I'll be there, hm?

229
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,949
And what are you doing instead
of coming to our sessions?

230
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,201
I'm dealing
with something important, okay?

231
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,371
Yeah, but what are you doing
that's more important than this?

232
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,164
<i>I'll tell you next time we meet.</i>

233
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,249
<i>Hyungwoo, remember...</i>

234
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,376
<i>- You said you could do that thing?
- </i>What?

235
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,919
<i>- Hypnosis therapy.</i>
- Hypnosis?

236
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,883
You said... you went to some seminar
or something when you were in college.

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,468
I went to flirt with girls.

238
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,721
Why are you interested in that?

239
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,266
So can it...
bring back my forgotten memories?

240
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,602
And stuff like that. You get the idea.

241
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,190
Jihyo, what are you doing?

242
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,859
Are you still on the phone?

243
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,652
Yeah! It'll be just a sec.

244
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,793
- Hyungwoo...
- It's your turn to do this.

245
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,216
- I'll get back to you later.
- I'm feeling my brain cells die.

246
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,867
Hong Jihyo.

247
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,494
She says whatever and then hangs up.

248
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,539
And so? Found something?

249
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,084
I found that the real estate lady
really enjoys eating.

250
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,422
Cap, I need a refill.

251
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,219
Hey.

252
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,514
I still can't believe any of this.

253
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,768
To think that church guy was
actually Direct Kim all along...

254
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,687
I know...
I think it'd be better if it wasn't.

255
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,771
- Why?
- Ugh.

256
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,982
You said you've been
looking for him for years.

257
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,233
You should be enjoying this.

258
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,488
It's just that I can't believe all I found
was such a frustrating little guy.

259
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,907
- Ugh.
- Whatever.

260
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
Oh, fuck, I have a headache.

261
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
Damn it.

262
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,709
Huh?

263
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,051
What is it?

264
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
What is this?

265
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,733
That's the place.

266
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,901
The place?

267
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,294
Wait. Wait.

268
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,255
Wait a minute.

269
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,966
It's here.

270
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,146
You sure?

271
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,524
Totally.

272
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,568
- It's there.
- Aren't you confused?

273
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm not confused!

274
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,572
I'm not confused at all.

275
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,699
I'd never be.

276
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,790
Direct Kim, motherfucker.

277
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,294
I knew there was something fishy
about that real estate lady.

278
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,385
Come on, come on.

279
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,139
The top of my head is so hot.

280
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:42,186
If you raise me up this high,
I'm too close to these hot lights.

281
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,689
I feel like an ant
under a magnifying glass.

282
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,192
- Gosh!
- Oh... Should I lower you, then?

283
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
Lower me down a bit.

284
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,526
Okay.

285
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,279
DOWN

286
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,574
There we go. Yes.

287
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,909
More. More.

288
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,994
Great. More.

289
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,245
Stop!

290
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,875
- What a relief. This is much better.
- I'll lift you to this comfortable height.

291
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,835
And don't relax your back.

292
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
All right.

293
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,094
Ooooh, that's good, that's good.
Oh. There you go.

294
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,430
Safe landing.

295
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,849
Great work.

296
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,311
- There. Oh, you did so good.
- Ugh, my back is killing me.

297
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,522
Oh, my back hurts. Oh!

298
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,111
I'm sorry that, uh... I put you through
so much trouble each time.

299
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,988
Hey! No problem.
It's the least I can do, huh?

300
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,366
To receive grace.

301
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,912
COME IN

302
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,374
- Go!
- For real?

303
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,626
Please don't tell me
that you're hesitating now.

304
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,461
And what if we really get caught?

305
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,631
She's at the church service right now.
We need to do it quickly.

306
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,591
What if she forgot something
and comes back?

307
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,927
Oh shit! Are you doing it or not?

308
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,263
We need to know who made that drawing.

309
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
Okay, okay, okay.

310
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,081
Please...

311
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,405
UNDER CONSTRUCTION DO NOT ENTER

312
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,625
Oh! God...

313
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,044
Chanwoo, are you busy today?

314
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,129
Not at all.

315
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,757
Well, then, would it be possible
for you to pick up Brother Han? Okay?

316
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,481
Yes, I'll do it. Do you have other plans?

317
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,821
Well, I have something important
that I need to attend to.

318
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,680
- Oh!
- I'll leave it to you, then.

319
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,473
Okay.

320
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,895
Damn it, why isn't this working?

321
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,855
Bora! Do you know how to use it?

322
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,649
- I just saw a tutorial online.
- Don't make me nervous.

323
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,443
You better hurry up, Bora.

324
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,531
Ah, shit! Why doesn't it inflate?

325
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,076
- Please, please.
- Don't rush me.

326
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,878
What?

327
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,467
Damn it.

328
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,595
Ugh! Give it to me. Let me do it!

329
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,805
Damn it!

330
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,979
Oh, oh! Oh-oh!

331
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,149
Oh! Hey, hey! Hey!
It's actually working. Oh!

332
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,027
Yeah! That's it! Just a little more.
Oh, oh, oh!

333
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,695
Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

334
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,157
Oh, you're doing great! It's working,
it's working, it's working, it's working.

335
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,492
Oh, oh!

336
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh! It worked! It worked!
It worked, it worked!

337
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,663
- Oh, God!
- That's it, get in!

338
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh!

339
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,170
It worked!

340
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,463
Get in! Get in!

341
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,842
Ah, shit.

342
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,595
Hey.

343
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,430
Why is this so difficult?

344
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,808
- How do I turn it on?
- Huh? What was that?

345
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,559
Try to turn the GPS on.

346
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,478
What are all these switches for?

347
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,313
I don't know how to turn it on.

348
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,942
What? Don't you have a license?

349
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,362
Yeah, but I don't use it.

350
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,781
Oh! God damn it!

351
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,325
HOW TO TURN ON A GPS

352
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,911
This is why we have internet.

353
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,373
Oh shit, this is not happening.

354
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,170
It looks like you have
to start the car to see the GPS.

355
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,090
- But how do I...
- Start the car.

356
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,842
How do I do it?

357
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,136
No...

358
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
- Hey, Chanwoo.
- Yeah?

359
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,642
- If you join the NPC, you must do better.
- Hide. Come on. We have to hide, please!

360
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,578
- What...
- I usually don't share all this.

361
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,939
- But you're such a great prospect.
- What do we do now?

362
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,358
- What I have been sharing is a secret...
- The back seat!

363
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,985
Okay.

364
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,238
- Go on. Go to the back. Hide! Hide!
- Of course, I feel honored.

365
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,284
Uh, you're erasing all the stuff
I've shared with you in the chat,

366
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,452
isn't that right?

367
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,162
Ouch!

368
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,581
- From the group chat?
- Oh, yeah.

369
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,417
Of course. Of course,
I'm erasing it all immediately.

370
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
That's right.

371
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,589
- With your silence...
- Is the pillar of faith!

372
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,049
Exactly. Good.

373
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,383
Good, very good.

374
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,053
- Ah, shit...
- I'll get going.

375
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, wait! Listen, Sister Seo!

376
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,016
Uh... Mmph...

377
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,309
Uh...

378
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,273
Could you just...

379
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,525
Uh... I mean, you...

380
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,779
You haven't been looking so great lately.

381
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,030
And frankly...

382
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,369
I feel that you're, uh... you've been, uh...
Working in excess.

383
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,537
I am... worried about you.

384
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,748
What can I do?

385
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,710
Chanwoo, you're such a sweet man.

386
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,341
- Oh my!
- Thanks. Thanks.

387
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,985
- You pretend to be so indifferent.
- Uh...

388
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,887
But you're quite considerate. Thank you!

389
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,515
What?

390
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,309
So, what's the word for people like that?

391
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,144
- You remember the slang?
- Uh...

392
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,189
- That word the kids use nowadays, hmm?
- No, uh...

393
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,030
BROTHER HAN

394
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,157
Is that Brother Han?
Uh, answer it, please.

395
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,659
- Go ahead, Brother.
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,452
- You gotta get going.
- Okay.

397
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,204
- See you later. Thank you!
- Yeah.

398
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,063
Hello, Brother Han.

399
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,281
And there's that. Now you get it?

400
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,700
It's just that...

401
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,828
How long has it been
since you started dating?

402
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,288
I'm not dating Ms. Hong.

403
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,585
You say that you're not dating, then...
Are you fucking her?

404
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,089
Sehee, I'm not having sex with her.
There's nothing going on between us yet...

405
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,466
Not <i>yet?</i>

406
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,217
So then you're planning to?

407
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,720
Uh... I'm not planning anything, okay?

408
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,680
Actually, it's just that...

409
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,141
we're keeping contact with each other.

410
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,019
Oh, okay. And what is it
that you guys even talk about?

411
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,734
Listen, hm?

412
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,779
How deeply in love can you possibly be

413
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,532
that your relationship
keeps Jihyo from going home?

414
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,912
Ms. Hong doesn't go home? Are you sure?

415
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,707
Yeah. She doesn't even
come to work often these days.

416
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,127
Her dad was so worried about her
that he even decided to call me.

417
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,170
What?

418
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,341
Well, haven't the two of you
been living together?

419
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,092
Uh...

420
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,389
What?

421
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,809
What is it? Huh?

00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,995
Huh? Huh?

469
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,101
ALLOW "MAPS" TO ACCESS YOUR LOCATION?

470
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,187
Oh, damn it.

471
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,524
Where are we?
I can't call a taxi from here.

472
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,610
Let's try going in there.

473
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,155
Have you lost your mind?

474
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,700
The woman said she'd
return to the church later.

475
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,744
Let's wait until then
and break in to investigate.

476
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,413
Why would we go in there?

477
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,581
Huh? It's a house, nothing more.

478
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,542
The house she lives in.

479
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,794
I'm not so sure.

480
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,464
Think about it.
The lady's job is in Seoul,

481
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,925
her church is here,
her license plates are from there.

482
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,803
So why would she...
live so far in this house?

483
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,098
Especially when she's a real estate woman.
Isn't that weird?

484
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,860
THE MARCH OF BLESSING

485
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,533
<i>Sister, it's Chanwoo.</i>

486
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,412
<i>Are you all right?</i>

487
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,961
Jeez!

488
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,548
Whoa, what's that?

489
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,300
Oh. Oh!

490
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,093
Oh, oh, oh!

491
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,636
He's so unbelievable.

492
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,056
- Hey...
- Oh...

493
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,812
Hey... Here.

494
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,857
You. Surveillance.

495
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,150
What?

496
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,464
- What are you doing? Stay here.
- Hey!

497
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,614
- Hey, no!
- Hey!

498
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,157
Damn it!

499
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,700
No, Bora!

500
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,411
No, Bora!

501
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,914
Hey, Bora!

502
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,997
Hey!

503
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,709
Hey... Hey!

504
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,861
Mother!

505
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Hey, Ma!

506
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,533
It's time to eat!

507
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,665
I made <i>doenjang jjigae</i> for you!

508
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,671
Mother! Hey, Ma!

509
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,673
Hi, Ma!

510
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,716
I made food.

511
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,260
Do you wanna watch TV?

512
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,011
Yeah? All right.

513
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,556
There you go.

514
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,682
Okay.

515
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,101
Careful, careful, careful.

516
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,354
Okay. There...

517
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,898
<i>- Whoa!</i>
- Nice.

518
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,900
<i>- Wow, Kinder, you're amazing!
- Whoopee!</i>

519
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,485
<i>It's good that we listened to Tayo!</i>

520
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
Mom. Say, "ah."

521
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,407
<i>Ugh, isn't it too dangerous?</i>

522
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,324
"Aah..."

523
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,427
<i>It's always you doing it alone.</i>

524
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,537
Mother, I'll peel an apple for you.

525
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,663
So eat that.

526
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,666
I'm going to the church.
I'll see you tomorrow.

527
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,253
You'll be okay at home alone.

528
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,046
I'll be back soon, all right?

529
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,385
Okay.

530
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,890
Careful, careful.

531
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,266
Aaah!

532
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,979
A goddamn cult?

533
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:44,402
No, are you saying that.. Lee Siguk
is now part of a weird, secret cult?

534
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,653
No!

535
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,907
You can't say anything for sure just yet.

536
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,491
We can't tell Ms. Hong, okay?

537
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,287
She might feel upset, and that's exactly
why I was keeping my mouth shut.

538
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,039
It makes sense, actually...

539
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,000
If it's him who we talk about,

540
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,003
I think it's possible
he got into stuff like that.

541
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,259
So, then... Hmm.

542
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,346
You're investigating this whole situation.

543
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,349
It's not even an investigation.

544
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,560
It's something I looked into
in my spare time, and that's all.

545
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,896
And so? How are you investigating?

546
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,024
I mean, you go out and interview people,
pop some questions?

547
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,859
Sure, for now, I have to get out there,

548
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,487
'cause the computer alone
won't get me anywhere.

549
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,989
All right.

550
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,909
I'll help you.

551
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,204
- With what?
- You said you're doing it alone. right?

552
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,540
And who's gonna help you?
I think two heads are better than one.

553
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,459
Like a dual-core.

554
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,543
No thanks.

555
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,010
<i>Whoopee!
It's good that we listened to Tayo!</i>

556
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,596
Hey, hey, hey.

557
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,392
Pyew, pyew, pyew, pyew, pyew, pyew!
Hah!

558
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,645
<i>This is so fun!
What should we do after the exams?</i>

559
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,562
<i>I'm not sure!</i>

560
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,940
Hey! Don't do that.

561
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
Hey!

562
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,362
- Leave her.
- Okay!

563
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,030
Her mind's left the planet.

564
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,992
All right. Let's do this!

565
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,660
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

566
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,621
- Let's start the search.
- Search for what in this house?

567
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,207
I've no idea!

568
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,130
Look for your boyfriend's fingers
or something.

569
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,295
<i>Don't run so fast! It's dangerous!</i>

570
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,841
<i>Oh, no. I'm sorry.</i>

571
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,092
<i>I didn't know.</i>

572
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,096
<i>Thank you, Tayo.</i>

573
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,523
<i>You shouldn't hesitate to give
stern advice, even to your friends.</i>

574
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,775
<i>All right, I'll remember that.</i>

575
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,113
<i>The school classes are over.</i>

576
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,323
<i>What was that sound?</i>

577
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,366
<i>Don't come near me!</i>

578
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,957
<i>- Stop right there!
- No!</i>

579
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,880
<i>You shouldn't hesitate to give
stern advice, even to your friends.</i>

580
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,722
There you go.

581
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,223
<i>Heart doesn't like it!</i>

582
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,559
<i>Be careful.</i>

583
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,817
<i>What did I do wrong?</i>

584
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,573
<i>I can't believe I yelled at a friend.</i>

585
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
Tayo.

586
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,457
Huh?

587
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,919
Tayo.

588
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,158
<i>Tayo the Little Bus!</i>

589
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,213
Oh!

590
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
Right.

591
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,094
Yes, that's Tayo.

592
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,637
Tayo.

593
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,138
Jihyo, what are you doing?

594
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,349
- Don't waste time on her.
- Tayo.

595
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,767
Come take a look at this.

596
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,727
Tayo.

597
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,899
Tayo... Tayo... Tayo... Tayo...

598
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,330
And now I'm convinced
getting old is terrible.

599
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,041
The aging process is inevitable.

600
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,669
- Yeah...
- Damn.

601
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,475
Why do all of these photos
have the exact same background?

602
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,312
They were taken at the same place.

603
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,647
BAEK-IL NATIONAL WELFARE CENTER

604
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,859
Wait a minute.

605
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,988
This is quite a familiar face.

606
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,409
Hmm?

607
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,546
Oh shit.

608
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,591
So freaky.

609
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,891
Bora, I think I'll...

610
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,643
...search
another part of the house.

611
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,811
Yeah.

612
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,322
Bora! Come here right now!

613
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,069
What the hell does this mean?

614
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,671
- Oh! Hey! Hey! Quickly, hide!
- Shh!

615
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,443
Who's that?

616
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,169
Huh?

617
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,675
- Oh shit...
- Wh...

618
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,010
Return it!

619
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,637
Give it to me!

620
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,515
<i>Gimme a break! The NPC?</i>

621
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,226
That was all nonsense, right?
You just made it all up.

622
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,645
But why would you tell us
such an idiotic lie?

623
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,189
Look! Look! Right away, you got busted!

624
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,360
I did it because I knew you would
go around causing trouble, okay?

625
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,571
Do you know how much
of a pest you are? Huh?

626
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,240
I had, like, a dozen heart attacks
and several strokes today.

627
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,076
Are the drawings locations
where UFOs appeared?

628
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,499
We already came this far, so just tell
us everything you know at the moment.

629
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,936
- What did we see back there?
- Mh-hm. Yeah, we want to know.

630
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,397
- Who drew all those pictures?
- And what is this church really?

631
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,007
And the thing with the aliens?
How are they related?

632
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,635
Uh-huh. Yeah. Did that real estate woman
draw those pictures?

633
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,159
Don't play coy, little man!

634
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,306
We already saw
all the content on this hard drive!

635
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,226
Okay, okay. Just don't yell at me.
Just please be quiet, I'm begging you.

636
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,522
It was the Holy Mother.

637
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,523
Huh?

638
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,609
The Mother. The church's Holy Mother.

639
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,444
You mean like the Virgin Mary?

640
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
Okay, and who's that?

641
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,491
What do you mean by that?
You must have seen her inside.

642
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,284
Inside?

643
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,619
Huh?

644
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,414
Did you see her?

645
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,510
The crazy old lady?

646
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,595
But how could that lady be the...

647
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,723
How could she know
that my boyfriend disappeared and...

648
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,101
and paint the exact location, huh?

649
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,190
Huh? Can you please stop
being so mysterious about this?

650
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,942
Just give me a logical answer?

651
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,986
Please?

652
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,240
Are you listening?

653
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,283
Answer me!

654
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,121
Oh, shit. Oh!

655
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,788
Huh?

656
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,376
Now I know where I've seen her before.

657
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,544
What?

658
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,676
You have also seen her before.

659
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,176
Huh?

660
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,472
<i>Back Yoonsun.</i>

661
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,975
What? <i>The</i> Back Yoonsun?

662
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,102
Yeah, the Back Yoonsun
from the UFO Incident.

663
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,785
What's the UFO Incident?

664
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,612
The attempted shoot-down
of the UFO.

665
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:46,610
In 1978, in the sky of Seoul,
several UFOs appeared in a formation.

666
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,334
Back Yoonsun is the woman who claimed
that she met aliens that day.

667
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,883
Something like that occurred in Korea?

668
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:55,536
This lady... She claimed at the time that
she could actually contact the aliens.

669
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,123
She said that they planted
some sort of chip inside of her head.

670
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,082
Wow!

671
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,166
Jihyo.

672
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,210
Don't you remember that?

673
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,547
You were totally obsessed
with this in middle school.

674
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,844
And so what happened to this Back woman,
or whatever her name is?

675
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,762
She disappeared after the interview.

676
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,764
A bunch of rumors arose
when that occurred.

677
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,268
Some people said that an institute
kidnapped her to do research in secret.

678
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,145
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

679
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:26,108
So you're saying that both of you found
Direct Kim and Back Yoonsun, seriously?

680
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,486
The first person to encounter aliens?

681
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,238
But how could she become
the Holy Mother of a cult?

682
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,699
Exactly. Where has she been
all these years, anyway?

683
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,409
I believe she was here.

684
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,873
Look at the date. All of these pictures
were taken after the newspaper interview.

Baek-Il
National Welfare Center.

686
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,588
What kind of place is that?

687
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,923
I have no idea.

688
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,175
It says "National."
it must be a public facility.

BAEK-IL NATIONAL WELFARE CENTER

690
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,137
It's a private psychiatric hospital now.
It's called New Hope.

NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
HOSPITAL HISTORY

692
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,576
They changed it. It was
Hope and Light Assisted Living Facility.

693
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Where is it?

694
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,229
Uhhh...

695
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,563
Here.

696
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,274
Jeonju. It's only four hours away.

697
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,526
Captain.

698
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,443
Hm?

699
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,528
Take us there.

700
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,279
- Huh?
- Huh?

701
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,281
- You're going now?
- Captain.

702
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:18,786
No, no, no, I can't, nah. I'll lose muscle
if I don't sleep well. I can't.

703
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,955
- I mean...
- I can give you a meal full of protein.

704
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,252
- Yes!
- Come on, dude!

705
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,547
A nice road trip! I'll go pack.

706
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,674
A nice read trip, you say?

707
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,052
You guys are...
How are you in sync all of a sudden?

708
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,262
Hey, Moonhole.

709
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,348
Why in the world are you doing this,
and why travel there right now?

710
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,517
Would you prefer I went on Christmas?

711
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,604
If you're curious, you... you can go back
to that lady and ask her about all the...

712
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,690
What would I ask an old
lady who's lost her mind?

713
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,609
Then...
perhaps you can ask Direct Kim.

714
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,112
Ugh, forget that man!
I'd rather go ask a sweet potato.

715
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,657
- I... can't stand those places!
- Then don't go, man!

716
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,994
Hey, Jihyo. We're leaving now.

717
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,251
I'm going home. I'll be right back, soon.

718
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,045
See you in an hour.
If you're late, we leave you behind.

719
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,398
- Okay!
- Okay!

720
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,883
God damn it!
None of this is even confirmed.

721
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,385
You don't even know what's there.

722
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,471
- Give me a reason for this!
- Ugh, stop looking for a reason!

723
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,725
Not everything in this giant
world happens for a fucking reason.

But tonight, finally<i>,</i>

730
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,560
I'll be stepping into
the very heart of a mystery.

731
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,562
Are you all the morons?

732
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,314
Or am I the moron here?

733
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,608
Only history will judge that!

734
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,279
Hmm? Hmm?

735
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,836
Are the others... not here yet?

736
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,382
They're never punctual,
you should know that.

737
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,885
- And Captain, where is he?
- He's lifting weights.

738
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,053
At this hour?

739
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,931
He said he wanted to do it now
in case he can't tomorrow.

740
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,766
- 26.27.
- Ah. Bora, here.

741
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,227
Oh.

742
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,356
Oh. Oh!

743
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,692
Whoa!

744
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,114
Hey. Behold.

745
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,490
My work of art.

746
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,283
- Huh?
- Hey.

747
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,748
You are an airhead, you don't remember it.

748
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,964
Oh, amazing!

749
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,966
Even the notes are still here.

750
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:23,220
Ah, I had no idea highlighters
lasted for this long.

00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,060
Bora.

752
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,729
I can see aliens.

753
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,444
It started when we were in high school.

754
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,904
I just see them sometimes.

755
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,241
I'm just minding my own business,

756
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,660
and then I see one.

757
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,913
And he's just staring back, I guess.

758
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,001
What are you talking about?

759
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
What kind of aliens do you mean?

760
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,758
Mmm...

761
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,927
Well, you know the one we...

762
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,431
the one that we drew together
in middle school?

763
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,102
This here?

764
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,438
Mm-hm.

765
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,649
But it's changed,
'cause I don't see him so often now.

766
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,610
Since when?

767
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,113
I'm not sure.

768
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,115
Since... I became friends with you.

769
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,747
It's incredible.

770
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,294
Why did you always
listen to my bullshit as if it was true?

771
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,882
Was it the reason you left a message
on my blog? That one in particular?

772
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,637
It was that and...
Siguk played a part as well.

773
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,641
But I don't understand
why I'm here,

774
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,143
telling you all about my hallucinations.

775
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,104
I've only ever told my therapist.

776
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,899
The phrase "screen image,"
do you remember that?

777
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,446
Um... If you witness a shocking situation,

778
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,825
something so shocking
that it's completely unbelievable,

779
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,077
the human mind covers up that image

780
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:15,040
with a different image,
something more... digestible for you.

781
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,461
For example, a drawing like this.

782
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,048
Something so shocking
that it's completely unbelievable.

783
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:24,966
Like what, exactly?

784
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,678
Well... For example...

785
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,514
an encounter with a real alien.

786
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,891
A real alien?

787
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,567
What if, you know...

788
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,694
I didn't hallucinate?

789
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,281
What if something like
aliens exists in real life, Bora?

790
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,283
What if I'm able to see that?

791
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,451
That makes me a what?

792
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,962
What do you mean? You'd still be an idiot.

793
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,895
120.

794
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,231
121.

795
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,693
122.

796
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,040
Hi, Ma!

797
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,251
Are you already awake?

798
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,503
Gosh!

799
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,927
Did you fall asleep here
watching the television again?

800
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,220
I had already told you
to sleep in your room!

801
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,764
I can't believe you, Mom!

802
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,583
Oh!

803
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,931
Hello, Father.

804
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,725
She's finally shown herself.

805
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,022
She has... revealed...

806
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,484
The Messiah arrived!

807
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,612
She's here at last.

808
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,908
The Messiah!

809
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,369
The Messiah...

810
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,330
She's finally come!
