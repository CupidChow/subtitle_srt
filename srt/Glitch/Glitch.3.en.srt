189
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,005
You just sounded so goddamn desperate.

190
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,926
You were babbling
complete nonsense to a total stranger.

191
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,680
It sounded sincere, in a way.

I'll be on my way.

194

Why didn't you go tell the cops?

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,566
Just saying!
Your boyfriend vanishes on you,

196
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,319
I would've gone
straight to the fucking cops.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,490
And, well, here you are,
thinking about this shit, randomly.

198
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,952
- No, I did go to the cops. I did, and...
- They said he was a runaway?

199
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,080
Then they sat you down
with all this evidence.

200

Yo.

Do you know how easy it is
to create evidence

206

in a society that's run
with pieces of paper?

207
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,317
It's easier than uploading
a YouTube video.

208
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,530
A little bit of keyboard tapping,
bullshit becomes fact, doesn't it?

209
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,991

- Let me talk.

211
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
You didn't buy the bullshit, though,

212

00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,716
It might be because
you're not a legit fan like us.

308
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,844
If you were really crazy about UFOs,

309
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,096
there's no way
you wouldn't know this story.

310
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,141
Oh, Donghyuk, how ya doin'?

311
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,226
'Sup with her? Why's she makin' that face?

312
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,186
She said her boyfriend got abducted.

313
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,525
Tell me more, Phillip.

314
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,820
There's a high possibility
that he was kidnapped by a cult.

315
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,030
If the newbie's babblings
are accurate, I mean.

316
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,700
- Moonhole's making a YouTube video on it.
- Oh!

317
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,785
Wait, do you still have subscribers?

318
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,508
Honestly, I'm not sure about it.

319
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,208
Even though you said you guys are friends,
to me, she seems like an attention seeker.

320
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,460
Everything she says sounds like a lie.

321
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,546
She believes it. She's not lying.

322
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,218
Bora! This! It's here in Seoul.

323
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,471
Seoul. I'm sure of it.

324
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,766
SEOUL

325
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,103
Did you get electromagnetic
waves from here? Like an EMP?

326
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,521
It looks normal, though.

327
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,605
SEARCH SEOUL CHURCHES
DIRECT KIM'S MISSING DAUGHTER

328
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,192
Jihyo, you saw it with your own eyes?

329
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,859
Uh, yes.

330
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,238
But isn't this that, uh...

331
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,406
You know, what's it called?

332
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,450
- Crop circle.
- Crop circle, right! Crop circle!

333
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,827
The thing that appears where UFOs show up.

334
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,039
But why didn't you take a picture
instead of drawing it like this?

335
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,291
Ah, well... I did try, but...

336
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,420
<i>- The bugs ran off.
- What bugs?</i>

337
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,841
Well, the bugs, they started to, uh...
make a pattern,

338
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,093
they started moving together.

339
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,930
It was like there was a invisible
substance and they were,

340
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,265
like... responding to it.

341
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,311
- It's for sure aliens.
- Hey, you punk.

342
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,021
You need to think about what's likely.

343
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,273
It was obviously those assholes
from the church.

344
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,984
No way,
that makes no sense at all.

345
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,112
What sort of church uses an EMP
and can control bugs?

346
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,423
Everyone!

347
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,449
Let's stop this pointless argument.

348
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,702
There's no evidence for
the EMP or anything. No evidence.

349
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,038
She's clearly just trolling us,
and we've taken the bait.

350
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,201
Do you even know what
an EMP is? You weren't even in the army.

351
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,090
- You're bringing that up?
- I'm stating facts, punk.

352
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,339
- Games? EMPs everywhere.
- What is an EMP, then? Tell me.

353
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,757
- Do you?
- Phillip, do you know?

354
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,040
- Oh, dude, no.
- I don't know!

355
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,528
- How would you? You weren't in the army.
- Can you... Can you...

356
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,553
- Tell me.
- Do you know?

357
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,823
- Can you guys please...
- Of course I know what an EMP is.

358
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,516
- I play video games!
- Quiet!

359
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,226
- Ah!
- Fucking scared me.

360
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,438
Aliens! Cults! I don't know!

361
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,607
That's not my business! Whatever it is.

362
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,691
My...

363
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,485
My boyfriend disappeared.

364
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,072
He disappeared!
And then I saw this at that place.

365
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,158
And Direct, or Indirect,
also saw this, you see?

366
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:29,121
So I need to find that church or temple,
whatever it is. I need to find it! Why?

367
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,873
Because I need to find my
damn boyfriend, no matter what!

368
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,091
Bora.

369
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,305
This Direct Kim person,
is there any way to meet, or...

370
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,683
Can't meet him.
He disappeared, and so did the blog.

371
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,395
The blog that you saw
is backup data that I made in case.

372
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,107
In that case, the cop that led the case,
let's try contacting him.

373
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,652
I'm sure the cops are just gonna
give us someone's personal info.

374
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,573
Look, whatever you're thinking of,
I've already tried it.

375
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,976
How long did it take me
to make that video, you think, huh?

376
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,205
Then why me, huh?

377
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,167
Then why'd you bring me here? Huh?

378
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,710
Why'd you show me this?

379
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
Huh? You said these
don't even count as clues.

380
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,714
Hmm...

381
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,192
Sign it.

382
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,629
From now on, your boyfriend is my lead.

383
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,988
CONSENT TO USE OF PORTRAIT RIGHTS

384
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,824
Anyway, Direct Kim's bait is too
old for me to investigate, but...

385
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,410
the one you brought me
is nice and fresh, isn't it?

386
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,497
Gonna use your boyfriend's
case for a video. So sign it.

387
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,293
Hold on. I'm not...

388
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,253
- Why should I?
- Why should you?

389
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,697
Your boyfriend's out there, right?

390
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,760
Uh... No, that's not...

391
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,766
How are <i>you </i>going to find him?

392
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,769
If we all put our heads together,
something's bound to show.

393
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,104
You'll see, it'll turn up.

394
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,732
Look how hard
they're trying to help you over there.

395
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,358
Right?

396
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,283
Ugh.

397
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,548
- Oh, Jihyo! Here, here, here.
- Oh! Ah.

398
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,716
- Ah, sorry I'm late.
- No, no, no.

399
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
I just got here too. Sit, sit, sit.

400
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,637
The study session went longer
than I thought it would.

401
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,722
I thought I could make it on time, but...

402
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,307
Why are you moving over here?

403
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,393
Are you okay with pork jowl?

404
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,103
- We already ordered in advance.
- We?

405
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,648
Hong Jihyo.

406
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,084
You're really a pro at showing up late.

407
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,194
- Oh, hi, boss.
- Sit down.

408
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,030
Why are you calling me that?
We aren't at work.

409
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,866
- Have you rested well?
- Uh, yup.

410
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,744
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

411
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,914
Anyway, your daughter
is really something else, seriously.

412
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,168
- Hey, hey, I'll dish it out...
- She made a client wait for 40 minutes.

413
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,670
There's nothing too hard
about work life.

414
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,214
If you make a mistake,
all you need to do is say,

415
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,884
"My apologies, won't happen again, sir,"

416
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,344
and quickly correct
whatever mistakes you made, okay?

417
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,598
Never do this again, please.
I'm begging you, don't.

418
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,057
Now, what is this about?

419
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,478
How long are you gonna keep
managing my work life, Dad?

420
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
Hey, that's not what this was.

421
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,191
You were completely dejected for days
over a little mistake,

422
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,194
so I... I made it so you could have
the opportunity to hash it out!

423
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,988
Then maybe tell me?
You could've at least let me know, right?

424
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,323
I don't want to argue with you.

425
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,509
I'm 30 years old
and getting into a fight with my dad.

426
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,161
You're over 30, but still acting
like you're in middle school.

427
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,039
Aren't I right?
Your little B.S. study group excuse,

428
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,209
when you're really going
to those weird alien meetings again.

429
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,252
Are you in middle school?

430
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,670
You went through my desk?

431
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,755
Hey, listen.

432
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,504
If marriage is out the window, you should
at least focus harder on your work.

433
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,636
What? Why would you even say that?

434
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,971
Siguk and you broke up, right?

435
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,384
And where did you hear this?

436
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,060
I talked to your rebound guy.

437
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,771
Department of Public Order or whatever.

438
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,734
How do you end things in a way where
he wants to leave the country? Huh?

439
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,653
I can't understand you at all. Huh?

440
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,404
No, how could I understand?

441
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,366
In my day, the most we did
after a breakup was get wasted.

442
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,952
- That's not right.
- Am I wrong?

443
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,372
That man isn't my rebound
and Siguk didn't fly to another country.

444
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,083
Why do you keep nagging me
when you've no idea what's going on?

445
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,836
Then what happened, huh?
His bank records show he got the tickets.

446
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,356
That's what the cop said!

447
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,007
You think a little keyboard tapping
can't make that stuff up?

448
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,468
Yeah, here we go with
the weirdo stories again.

449
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,012
Did you pick that up
at the alien meetings?

450
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,223
I'm not going to alien meetings!

451
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,519
I heard he cleared out his entire place in
a single day, that boy. Oh, then, maybe...

452
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,272
- Did the aliens help him move out?
- Wrong! That's...

453
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
Good Lord.

454
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,235
<i>Hello, Radioactive Underpants.</i>

455
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,320
<i>Thank you for the 1,000-won donation.</i>

456
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,724
WHO'S THE MAN BEHIND? SEEMS TOUGH

457
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,993
I have to use my laptop
for the time being,

458
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,537
so please understand
the quality might be bad.

459
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,290
No, we can't play <i>Dead by Daylight</i>
all night<i>.</i>

460
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,542
I'm preparing a YouTube video right now.

461
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,462
<i>I'm trying to get the person on board.
You can look forward to this one.</i>

462
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,300
Shit! What the hell?
That's so loud, damn it.

463
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,762
Who sent the fucking cat picture?

464
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,639
I told you, I fucking hate cats.

465
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,932
Hey, Moonhole.

466
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,812
<i>Hold on a second, guys.</i>

467
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,147
<i>My mom's calling.</i>

468
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,862
- What?
- Aren't you going home?

469
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,530
I don't have a home, I was kicked out.

470
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,951
Then maybe you should be looking for one.

471
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,388
- I'm streaming right now.
- You should look during the day.

472
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,224
'Cause of you, I can't sleep,
and it's messing with my muscle synthesis.

473
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,917
Fuck, stop saying "muscle synthesis,"
could you?

474
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,879
Is all the protein on Earth yours now?

475
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,671
Whatever.

476
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,593
HONG JIHYO

477
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,304
Jihyo.

478
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,139
<i>Who the hell cleared out his room?</i>

479
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,203
- What the hell are you talking about?
<i>- Siguk. I'm talking about Siguk's room.</i>

480
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,147
<i>When I went there,
it was completely cleared out.</i>

481
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,650
Hey, hypothetically speaking<i>,</i>
abducted or just missing.

482
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,611
If it wasn't him, who?
Who cleared out his room?

483
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,364
<i>That room, that bed.
Who could have done it?</i>

484
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,200
<i>Whoever it was that cleared out that room,</i>

485
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,079
<i>isn't that the most direct connection
to his disappearance?</i>

486
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,915
Huh?

487
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,752
You believe it, then?

488
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,128
Huh?

489
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,839
<i>If we put our heads together,
something is bound to come up.</i>

490
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,928
So where is it?

491
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,263
The first scene of my video.

492
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,476
VALUE REAL ESTATE

493
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,103
Oh, you'll sign the contract?

494
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,271
Oh, thank you so much.

495
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,564
Ah! Mmm.

496
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,484
I'm so sorry, did you wait long?

497
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,486
Uh...

498
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,739
Are you the woman who called earlier?

499
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,116
REPRESENTATIVE SEO HWAJUNG

500
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,951
Uh... Actually...

501
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,870
I was the one that called.

502
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,083
I mean, your fashion choices are so
completely different from each other.

503
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,961
One of you is just so cute,
like a little kitty cat.

504
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,547
And the other one, so gentle, gentle...

505
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,465
Welsh corgi style.

506
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,718
Was that rude to say?

507
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,386
Oh, you're just so cute!

508
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,098
Ah, well we just came to Seoul
not too long ago.

509
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,100
I'm trying to find us a studio.

510
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,643
The two of you live together?

511
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,811
Yes.

512
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,814
Unni and I will live together here.
Apart from our families.

513
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,192
Oh... Then are you looking
into short-term or long-term rental?

514
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,876
Are there other places you've looked at?

515
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,446
No?

516
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,742
This place is amazing. I'm telling you.

517
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,161
You'll be really surprised. Just wait.

518
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,582
Really, you two cuties
are really lucky, you know? Huh?

519
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,126
You're in for a surprise!

520
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,754
Whoa!

521
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,130
Look at this.

522
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
A totally new home.

523
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,467
Wow!

524
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,550
Also...

525
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,721
- It's totally vacant.
- Wow!

526
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,057
You could pack your stuff
and move in right away.

527
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,519
- Wow!
- Oh, also, look at the sash on the window.

528
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,272
- It's brand new.
- Wow!

529
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,275
- Take a look! Have a look at this.
- Unni, Isn't this great, yeah?

530
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,489
What do you think? It's so comfy, right?

531
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,618
This home, I'm telling you,
your timing coming here was crazy.

532
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,536
- Isn't it really great?
- Yes!

533
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,039
- You have great taste.
- Why is this wallpaper new?

534
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,539
Yes?

535
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,292
The lighting also looks new.

536
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,961
Why was the interior redone?

537
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,714
The landlord wanted
to sell the place... probably.

538
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,674
And what does this person do for work?

539
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,759
Why do you ask?

540
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,057
He probably earns a living
off of monthly rent.

541
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,184
Could I get his contact info?

542
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,645
What? Why do you want it?

543
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,691
Also, could you find out who the moving
company the past tenant used was?

544
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,154
Goodness. I mean, I don't think...

545
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,408
We... well, I'll try to find out.

546
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,827
- Thank you very much.
- Hmm...

547
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,125
She's quite a meticulous
kind of person, isn't she?

548
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,294
I know, right?

549
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,630
She obsesses over weird,
off-putting things.

550
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,843
When we hang out together, people always
think that I'm the weirdo out of us,

551
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,761
After spending a little time with us,

552
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,721
they realize that I'm the normal one,

553
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,223
and that bitch is crazy.

554
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,186
Oh, you shouldn't
say stuff like that!

555
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,938
Oh, my stomach!

556
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:01,150
Sorry I couldn't show you the place for
too long. I have other clients waiting.

557
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,069
Oh, that's fine.

558
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,071
Oh my, you're so sweet.

559
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,615
Take care!

560
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,325
- Okay.
- Please make sure to call.

561
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,411
I will. Take care.

562
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,330
Bye!

563
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,416
Hurry up and leave already.

564
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,792
Good.

565
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,505
How I'm seeing it, the two places
we need to check are the moving company

566
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,949
- and the landlord's...
- Let's go.

567
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,097
Ah, shut the fuck up, dude.

568
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,348
Hey, what is it?

569
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,893
What was it?

570
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,061
I was watching
when she was entering the code.

571
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,646
Crazy, we're breaking so many laws!

572
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,557
Hey, hold this.

573
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,393
What's all this?

574
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,966
Film me! What are you doing?

575
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,634
That's what I wanna ask you.

576
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,262
- What the heck are you looking for? Huh?
- A narrowband microwave.

577
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,516
A what?

578
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,768
Ah, be quiet, I'm trying to listen here.

579
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,563
- Ugh.
- What the heck are you looking for here?

580
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,399
Alien waves.

581
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,567
The same waves from
your boyfriend's watch.

582
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,779
SETI standard electromagnetic bandwidth.
You don't know?

583
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,617
Why would I know what that is, huh?

584
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,665
Wow... You're a real blockhead, aren't you?

585
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,877
You don't remember inventing
all of these things?

586
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,546
This process, you...

587
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,673
I learned from you in junior high.

588
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,074
PHOTOMETER

589
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,208
Huh...

590
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,669
"Huh."

591
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,880
Moron.

592
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,508
Hey! Hey! Okay, but why are you...

593
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,928
Why are you trying so
hard to find them? Huh?

594
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,265
You were never even interested
in aliens or whatever.

595
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,060
I was obsessed.
You were just... a delinquent.

596
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,605
Ugh. You and that goddamn mouth of yours.

597
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,690
- Hey!
- What?

598
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,485
- Are we still looking for him, or...
- Of course we are!

599
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,945
I don't see how that's related
to any of this, though.

600
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,656
When did you become such a fucking idiot?

601
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,742
Just say what's on your mind, girl.

602
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
- And what's on my mind, then?
- Repeat after me.

603
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,372
Aliens abducted my boyfriend.

604
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,585
Try saying it.

605
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,046
Aliens abducted my boyfriend.

606
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,845
- Oh, it's so great to see you.
- Huh?

607
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,723
You really did great work.

608
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,309
- He said he met a girl.
- Oh my!

609
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,645
It looks great. Can't wait to see...

610
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,189
Oh gosh! You worked so hard.

611
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,038
Right?

612
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,379
- Wow, this is really nice. Great work.
- I still can't find the right switch.

613
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,048
- Oh, look at that.
- It's nice and home-y, you know?

614
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,425
Welcome in, everybody!

615
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,929
Sister Seo,
what's the rent like in here, huh?

616
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,932
Are you interested in real estate,
Brother Han? Are you?

617
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,476
Should I give you
all the housing information?

618
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,106
Come on, real estate?
That's your thing, Sister Seo.

619
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,776
I was also considering a place
like this, once I'm married.

620
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,988
Doesn't it seem like there's
a draft coming in from somewhere?

621
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,240
Is it coming in from here?

622
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,868
I'm not sure. Don't really know.

623
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,411
Is that it?

624
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,831
Sister Seo, can I look upstairs?

625
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,834
- Of course, of course.
- Hey. Go.

626
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,210
Where?

627
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,294
Oh, oh!

628
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,967
- Ah, this is the bathroom?
- Sister Back. Be careful on the stairs.

629
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,761
Wow, having the loft is nice.

630
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,270
Quickly, quickly.

631
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,997
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no! No, I can't.

632
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,042
I can't, I can't!

633
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,979
Oh my gosh...

634
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,857
It's so nice over here.

635
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,653
Oh, my. Wow!

636
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,488
- Sister Back?
- Ooh! Yeah?

637
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,570
Are you all done up there?

638
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,452
- Do you think we can get started now?
- Yes, yes, yes.

639
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,758
Huh?

640
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,178
Huh?

641
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,396
What is it?

642
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,991
Aaaah...
