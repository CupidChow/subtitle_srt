1
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,044
[Shibutani] Oops. Sorry.

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,971
[clicking]

3
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,677
[Mikami] That day, you brought in
a homemade bomb

4
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,782
hoping to carry out a suicide attack
that would take others with you.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,683
[clicking continues]

6
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,658
However, the bomb failed to detonate.

7
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,296
Switching tactics

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,068
you waited for Yusuke Shibutani,
your target, to stand up

9
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,803
and approached him from behind...

10
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,912
[panting]

11
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,113
[grunts]

12
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,915
[Mikami] ...and then
stabbed him in the back.

13
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,717
- [pants]
- [body thuds]

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,222
[students scream]

15
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,891
The knife you prepared
slipped between his ribs

16
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,460
reaching his heart.

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,629
He died within minutes.

18
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,698
[ominous music playing]

19
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,273
I won't say what you did was meaningless.

20
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,978
But it's also true that society
hasn't changed one bit.

21
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,883
Or maybe it has?

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,189
Because you are young and beautiful,
a fan club...

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,459
has formed for you
outside the prison walls.

24
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,664
Humiliating, isn't it?

25
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,600
I get it. But that's the reality.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,535
The very society you...

27
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,738
wanted to change

28
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,907
the shallow and thoughtless society...

29
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,008
Shut up.

30
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,711
Whether it's stabbing a plastic bag
with an umbrella in the subway

31
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,413
or crashing a plane into
a building and killing thousands

32
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,649
the world doesn't change.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,085
So why did you think killing

34
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,688
just one person would be
enough to change society?

35
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,423
Don't compare me to those people!

36
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,325
Even they had their own sense of justice.

37
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,661
They believed a better world
lay beyond their actions.

38
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,297
How are you any different?
Can you explain that logically?

39
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,835
- I...
- [prison officer] Time's up.

40
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,905
Don't misunderstand me.

41
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,708
I'm not here to judge you.

42
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,646
I just think I understand
how lonely your battle...

43
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,749
must have been.

44
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,287
Leave.

45
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,622
[Mikami] You won't be able to forget...

46
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,693
the face of the person you killed.

47
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,866
[dramatic music playing]

48
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,967
I'll be back.

49
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,145
[sobbing, yelling]

50
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,246
What's wrong?

51
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,317
[Mayama screaming]

52
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,853
[Mayama sobbing continues]

53
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,224
[dramatic music continues]

54
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:59,505
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,275
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

56
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,648
Mr. Mikami is taking a half-day today,
so I'll be leading homeroom.

57
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
[students] Huh?

58
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,753
Ms. Koreeda, what did Kanzaki do?

59
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,024
I haven't heard directly from him yet,
so today, here...

60
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,461
[Sakurai] Why is the school
ignoring this situation?

61
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,464
If you mean the reporters,
we've strongly protested.

62
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,533
No, I mean Mr. Mikami.

63
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,670
This doesn't make sense.

64
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,973
After all this chaos,
we're just supposed to focus?

65
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,508
Just drop it, Sakurai.

66
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:37,977
But...

67
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,882
Everyone's complaining in private

68
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,052
yet they make you stand up and say it.

69
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,254
Isn't that unfair?

70
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,092
Sakurai, sit down.

71
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,667
I'm aiming for an art university, right?

72
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,038
Before I play the violin,
I shut out all distractions.

73
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:09,342
I need pure, beautiful concentration.

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:16,149
I think all of us
are at that moment right now.

75
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,017
Well...

76
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,088
I know people say
the real world is full of noise.

77
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,759
But telling us to accept that now...
Isn't that just cruel?

78
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,731
That's true.

79
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,635
Yes.

80
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,073
I'll tell Mr. Mikami.

81
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,909
So please wait.

82
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,150
Ms. Saejima.

83
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,354
I thought I told you
not to come here anymore.

84
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,192
The media found out
about your relationship with Yuzuru-san.

85
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,127
What?

86
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,396
They also discovered
you used to teach at Rintoku.

87
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,868
And maybe even that store...

88
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,377
I'll give you an address.

89
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,012
Meet me there in an hour.

90
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,749
Is that okay?

91
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,085
Or would you prefer we talk
at a family restaurant?

92
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,555
That's out of the question, isn't it?

93
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,560
- [Mizohata] Mr. Mikami.
- What's going on?

94
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,830
Kanzaki-kun confronted the director.

95
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,999
He asked why the teacher
who resigned was a woman.

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,503
And then he disappeared.

97
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,273
Have you heard from him?

98
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,275
No.

99
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,381
[Mizohata] You didn't instigate him,
did you, Mr. Mikami?

100
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,983
I don't recall doing so.

101
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,085
If that's more bureaucratic double-speak,
I've had enough.

102
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,256
Regardless, when he comes to school,
please have a proper talk with him.

103
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,458
Understood.

104
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,172
[Kanzaki] Is it true you turned down

105
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,374
the transfer to Rintoku Seminar?

106
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,444
Even if it's just a cram school

107
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,579
I don't think I deserve to teach.

108
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,317
But Mr. Tsutsui continues teaching
like nothing happened.

109
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,221
If he can do it, then fine.

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
But...

111
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,730
you couldn't.

112
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,936
I thought it was time

113
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,872
to sever ties with the name "Rintoku."

114
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,645
Something happened
to make you feel that way, right?

115
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:03,883
Kanzaki-kun...

116
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,919
you really should stop.

117
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,758
I can't do that.

118
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,264
You have a long life ahead of you.

119
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,735
That's exactly why.

120
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,738
Because it's long

121
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,375
I have to think about it properly now.

122
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,046
I need to understand the meaning of...

123
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,850
what I've done.

124
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,855
Was the...

125
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,558
affair something you wanted?

126
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,029
Or was there a reason behind it?

127
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,866
My husband was physically abusive.
I had nowhere else to go.

128
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,002
That's all.

129
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,904
That's a lie.

130
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,373
Leave.

131
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,008
Please answer!

132
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,077
If I published a false article,
I have a duty to correct it.

133
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,546
It wasn't false.

134
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,548
So there's no need for a correction.

135
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,821
[dramatic music playing]

136
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,499
[lock clicks]

137
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,506
[Mikami] I understand Oguri-san's opinion.

138
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,676
Expecting that level of concentration
from students is irresponsible.

139
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,777
But...

140
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,279
Ignoring what happened
is even more dangerous.

141
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:42,982
Especially for Kanzaki.

142
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,054
[Mikami] You understand why, don't you?

143
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,259
Because it's a matter of life and death.

144
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,998
Are you afraid Kanzaki
will be the next victim?

145
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,137
I feel ashamed
of my own lack of imagination.

146
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,342
I tried to think about how
Kanzaki-kun must be feeling

147
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,743
if even I'm feeling this way.

148
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,481
Of course, he's deeply hurt.

149
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,486
[Mikami] But the longer we avoid it

150
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,022
the deeper the wound becomes.

151
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,727
That's why he has to find
the answer himself.

152
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,131
He has to understand
what he's struggling against.

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,835
Both the questions and answers...

154
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,871
are something only he can find.

155
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,722
[Makino] A gossip magazine journalist
sent this.

156
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:01,394
A student from Mikami's class
is snooping around that female teacher.

157
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,462
They're asking if they could publish it.

158
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,366
His father is a political journalist
at Toto Newspaper, after all.

159
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,837
Yeah, he's a pain to have as an enemy.

160
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,410
Should we stop them?

161
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,412
Yeah.

162
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,781
That'll be nice.

163
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,816

[chatter dies]

167
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,237
Kanzaki, do you have anything to say?

168
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,209
If you have questions, I'll answer them.

169
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,679
What's with the condescending attitude?

170
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,716
Hey. Relax, Fuyuki.

171
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,253
[Tsugimoto] Kanzaki said
he'll answer any questions.

172
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,222
So just ask like you normally would.

173
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,392
Right, Kanzaki?

174
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,630
I want to ask something.

175
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,003
Oh...

176
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,973
It's fine. Go on.

177
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,343
[Tsugimoto] Okay. Go ahead, Kurayoshi.

178
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,148
Kanzaki...

179
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,419
you said you wanted to uncover
the truth about the vultures.

180
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:38,023
Did that mean confronting
the chairman directly?

181
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,064
- Yeah.
- Wait, but...

182
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,667
Fuyuki, it's my turn right now.

183
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,039
What did you ask the chairman,
and how did he respond?

184
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,514
I asked why Ms. Saejima
was forced to resign.

185
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,984
He said she quit on her own.

186
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,855
And you thought that sounded like a lie?

187
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,595
Yeah.

188
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,696
Come on!

189
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,032
Hey, I just said
that it's my turn right now.

190
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:23,936
What's your basis for that?

191
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,172
[Kanzaki] I'm still investigating.

192
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,273
[Kurayoshi] I see.

193
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,776
I've always...

194
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,614
wondered why only Ms. Saejima
had to leave.

195
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,450
So I'll keep thinking about it myself

196
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,588
and I'll trust and wait for you, Kanzaki.

197
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,328
Uh... well...

198
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,731
And that ends my turn.

199
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,336
Does anyone else have any thoughts?

200
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,282
[Mikami] Now, let's start class.

201
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,752
All right, today we're on page 67.

202
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,358
This is the kind of question
where assuming an answer

203
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,627
from the start will backfire.

204
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,998
- [school bell chimes]
- That's the end of class.

205
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,800
[students] Thank you.

206
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
[Sakurai] Mr. Mikami,
why don't you stop students

207
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,910
from going off-topic during class?

208
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,712
- [Mikami] Off-topic?
- I mean Kurayoshi...

209
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,281
[Tominaga] Hey, why don't you
ask her directly?

210
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,784
I'm not saying she's wrong.
So it has nothing to do with her.

211
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,856
I'm a returnee student.

212
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,360
Huh? Does that matter?

213
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,661
In America

214
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,365
students are often made to express
their opinions, even in class.

215
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,500
High schoolers even have debate classes.

216
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,135
That's not what I'm talking about!

217
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,105
Just listen first.

218
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,875
We were taught that in discussions

219
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,144
it's important to listen to the end.

220
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,784
That's what I kept saying
even after coming back to Japan.

221
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,922
But that doesn't work here.

222
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,591
If you don't keep
your thoughts to yourself

223
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,093
people will see you as someone
who can't read the room.

224
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,629
This country is one of surface

225
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,798
and hidden truths.

226
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,001
I've learned that the hard way.

227
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,072
And it scared me.

228
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:47,146
Kurayoshi,
I didn't know you felt that way.

229
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,116
That's why

230
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,521
I developed the habit
of swallowing my words

231
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,457
when something was really important to me.

232
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,327
I started hating myself for it.

233
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,063
But...

234
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,933
I wanted to hear

235
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,338
what Kanzaki had to say.

236
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,379
Forget it.

237
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,880
Do whatever you want.

238
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,583
- Sakurai...
- [door opens]

239
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,719
[footsteps receding]

240
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,987
[chair scrapes]

241
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,925
[door opens]

242
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,094
[footsteps receding]

243
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,895
[sighs]

244
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,670
[in English] Thank you
for the opportunity.

245
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,107
Although English is also my first language

246
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,609
I was kind of embarrassed to use it.

247
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,314
[in English] Glad I could help. Good luck!

248
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,951
[in Japanese] What was that exchange?

249
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,652
Too cute.

250
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,021
[light laughter]

251
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,725
Kurayoshi, I've actually been wanting
to try debating for a while.

252
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,260
Teach me.

253
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,865
You split into opposing
and supporting sides, right?

254
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,101
Yeah, that's right.

255
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,372
[female student] How do you decide
the winner in a debate?

256
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,976
[Kurayoshi]
The judges determine the outcome.

257
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,184
Are you okay, Sakurai?

258
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,459
Everyone must be thinking

259
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,398
"Sakurai, with those grades,
who do you think you are?"

260
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,002
[Oguri] Really? You think so?

261
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,441
[Sakurai] In the end,
this school is all about grades.

262
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,978
Yeah, everyone's desperate.

263
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,613
They just don't show it.

264
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,756
I feel so stupid.

265
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,227
Why would you say that?

266
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,864
You work harder than anyone.

267
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,232
You have every right to be confident.

268
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,740
[computer game chatter]

269
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,210
[grunting]

270
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,385
[hissing]

271
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,056
Sorry for the wait.

272
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,091
Just a sec.
I'll take care of this real quick.

273
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,192
[grunts]

274
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,561
Done!

275
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,331
- Whoa...
- All right, let's go.

276
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,136
[doorbell chimes]

277
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,606
SHINONOME

278
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,676
[doorbell chimes]

279
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,449
Sorry, let's head home.

280
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,550
Hold on.

281
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,086
- What?
- It's open.

282
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,821
[gate clanks]

283
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,863
[wind blowing]

284
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,372
[gasps] Excuse me.

285
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,175
Are you all right?

286
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,076
Dad...

287
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,847
CHIBA WEST GENERAL HOSPITAL

288
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,348
[siren blaring]

289
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,452
[panting]

290
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,160
[Shinonome] Wait...

291
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,962
Why are they here?

292
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,432
Shinonome-san told me

293
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,435
she wanted to talk to her divorced father

294
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,137
so I accompanied her.

295
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,774
I told you didn't have to come with me.

296
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,511
Well, your mom's
not going to come, is she?

297
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,083
So I made the decision to call you.

298
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,819
Good call. Thanks.

299
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,257
[Tominaga] Tazune's family
situation is complicated.

300
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,961
She really wants to keep up with the class

301
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,063
now that things are moving forward.

302
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,666
But she's completely against Okami.

303
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,670
Is that why you left her behind?

304
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,874
[Tominaga] I thought she should
talk things out with Okami.

305
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,549
Want some bread?

306
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,518
No, thanks.

307
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,956
Ms. Koreeda insisted on buying it.

308
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,126
I thought, "Why is she thinking
about food at a time like this?"

309
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,029
But she said, "She must be hungry."

310
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,338
If you're bored,
you should eat it yourself, Mr. Mikami.

311
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,011
Or just...

312
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,613
go home.

313
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,524
[stomach growls]

314
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,560
[Kanzaki's father] Takuto, got a minute?

315
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,709
If you keep getting involved in this case

316
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,511
they said they'd publish these.

317
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,114
[emotional music playing]

318
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,053
I don't care.

319
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,857
Do you understand how it feels
to be the one being photographed?

320
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,199
MR. MIKAMI IS A CRIMINAL!

321
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,737
Are you having fun playing journalist?

322
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,777
[emotional music continues playing]

323
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,068
TAZUNE: I'M GOING TO TALK
DURING HOMEROOM TOMORROW.

324
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,842
OKAY!

325
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,518
[Mikami] Anyway, starting next week,
parent-teacher conferences

326
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,086
will be conducted remotely.

327
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,056
Please have your parents enter
their availability into the system.

328
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,360
If there are no questions,
this concludes homeroom.

329
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,570
Do you know what these are?

330
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,009
These are textbooks
your father made, right?

331
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,613
So you knew, and you pretended not to?

332
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,214
I wasn't pretending.

333
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:43,488
Mr. Mikami, don't you have
some responsibility in this?

334
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,791
Why?

335
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,442
Yesterday, my father collapsed.

336
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,709
[students] What?

337
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,614
Tominaga was with me and saved him.

338
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,951
If he had been found any later

339
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,053
he wouldn't have made it.

340
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,491
My father...

341
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,928
was a middle school teacher.

342
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,231
"Was"...

343
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,967
because he isn't one anymore.

344
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,945
He got caught using
his own teaching materials...

345
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,648
and the Ministry of Education
charged him with violating

346
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,350
curriculum guidelines.

347
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,451
That's right.

348
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:52,357
[Tsugimoto] Wait, using one's own
materials is against the rules?

349
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,794
Don't you use them, Ms. Koreeda?

350
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,662
Huh? Well...

351
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,865
[Mikami] As long as it's supplementary,
it's fine.

352
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,834
During compulsory education,
they must use textbooks that

353
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:06,137
have passed the government's textbook
screening process.

354
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,075
Well, many private schools
don't strictly follow that rule.

355
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,279
Huh? What's textbook screening?

356
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,314
If a textbook doesn't pass the screening,
it can't be used.

357
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:17,816
So private textbooks aren't allowed.

358
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,885
Really?

359
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,822
But Shinonome's father did not use
any approved textbooks.

360
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,757
He only used his own materials.

361
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,327
[Tsugimoto] Wow, none at all?
Yeah, that might be a problem.

362
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,964
[Oguri] But still,
firing a teacher over that is...

363
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,272
When the issue was discovered

364
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,509
he was warned multiple times.

365
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,946
But even after repeated warnings,
he refused to stop.

366
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,949
So in the end,
he wasn't allowed to teach anymore.

367
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,153
And eventually, he resigned voluntarily.

368
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,623
But that's not really
the Ministry of Education's fault, is it?

369
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:02,594
Why not? My parents got divorced
because of that.

370
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,462
Shinonome, let's calm down for a moment...

371
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,366
Mr. Mikami, have you
ever thought about this?

372
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,135
That the rules
set by the Ministry of Education

373
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,003
can tear families apart?

374
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,608
No... not really.

375
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:18,977
What?

376
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,447
The curriculum guidelines
aren't meant to protect family peace.

377
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,352
[Tominaga] Um, may I say something?

378
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,887
[Mikami] Of course.

379
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:36,328
Yesterday was the first time
I really learned about

380
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,996
her family situation.

381
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,364
And?

382
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,467
Then, I realized I couldn't say anything

383
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,169
without understanding the core issue.

384
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:47,739
So, I read the middle school
curriculum guidelines.

385
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,375
So what?

386
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,210
If you don't know what it is

387
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,179
you can't judge it,
positively or negatively, right?

388
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,750
[Mikami] Go ahead.

389
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,152
[tense music playing]

390
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:16,101
First of all,
the theme of the curriculum guidelines

391
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,336
is "The Power to Live."

392
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,373
If you read closely, they emphasize
creativity and ingenuity

393
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:29,581
developing thinking, judgment,
and expressive skills

394
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,319
and "education
that nurtures individuality."

395
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,791
So why exactly was her dad in the wrong?

396
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,028
The materials he created
were also designed to develop

397
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,498
"The Power to Live."

398
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,635
If anything, I bet using these to study
must have been really fun.

399
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,170
They're amazing teaching materials.

400
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,575
So, in the end, the only real issue

401
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,447
was that he failed to fulfill
the requirement

402
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,417
of using government-approved textbooks.

403
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,456
Hmm. Even so,
this document is so confusing.

404
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,926
[Mikami] Middle school
curriculum guidelines

405
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,928
are notoriously hard to understand.

406
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,598
Even among bureaucrats,
they keep saying it needs to be fixed.

407
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,768
So, this is a sharp critique.

408
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,439
But it doesn't justify
what Shinonome's father did.

409
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,644
I know that.

410
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,714
Then what do you want to do?

411
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,882
Huh?

412
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,417
You brought this up

413
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,454
because you wanted change, right?

414
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,494
Or did you just want me to apologize?

415
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:56,968
Think about it.

416
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,305
[string music continues]

417
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,320
Give me some time.

418
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,391
Okay.

419
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,763
[school bell chimes]

420
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,431
Everyone, let's all think about it too.

421
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,275
Thanks for the clear explanation.

422
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,977
[distant indistinct chatter]

423
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,211
Shinonome-san.

424
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,820
Your name comes from "Onkochishin," right?

425
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,291
"Learning from the past
to understand the new"...

426
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,560
That's why you're named "Tazune."

427
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,130
Yes.

428
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,433
My father gave me that name.

429
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,671
More like entrusted you with it, no?

430
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,307
[chuckles]

431
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,543
Yeah.

432
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,645
[somber music playing]

433
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:16,881
[Shinonome] And yet...

434
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,518
I got so shaken by my father collapsing

435
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,620
that I just got angry.

436
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,956
That's not true.

437
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,126
I think you raised a great question.

438
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,866
[Shinonome sniffling]

439
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,167
I just...

440
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,171
feel so frustrated.

441
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,774
[Koreeda] Yes.

442
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,044
[somber music continues playing]

443
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,516
- [Koreeda mumbles] It's ok.
- [Shinonome sobbing]

444
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,094
[Tsugimoto] Kanzaki!

445
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,065
- Want to come over today?
- Huh? Why?

446
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,434
Just come. I got some new information.

447
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,136
[Tsugimoto chuckles]

448
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,940
[Tsugimoto] You're gonna be shocked.

449
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,644
- [man] Kan-chan, welcome home.
- [Tsugimoto] I'm home!

450
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,312
- [man] Hello.
- [Kanzaki] Hello.

451
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,015
Come in.

452
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,117
[distant metal clanking]

453
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,853
[whirring]

454
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,658
- [man] Hello.
- [Kanzaki] Excuse me.

455
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:56,047
- Whoa, this is amazing!
- Huh?

456
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,950
[Tominaga] What is this?
This is incredible!

457
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,852
Why is Tominaga here?

458
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,987
- Did you build all of this, Jigen?
- Yeah.

459
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,957
Wow, so your parents
bought everything for you?

460
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,496
Our school has a lot of kids
from powerful families, right?

461
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,633
But in my case, academically speaking,
I was born into a weak family.

462
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,170
But then, a total anomaly,
a genius suddenly appeared.

463
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,409
Therefore, my folks are pretty loose
with the purse strings.

464
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,779
[in English] Hey, Lupin, PC on!

465
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,148
[Lupin in Japanese] Yes, sir.

466
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,583
[Tominaga] Huh? What did you just do?

467
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:37,188
I built my own voice-recognition AI.

468
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,425
Since my last name is Tsugimoto,
it's only natural for my nickname

469
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,526
to be Jigen, right?

470
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,328
Oh, that's why it's Lupin?

471
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,364
[in English] Yes, I am Lupin.

472
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,865
[laughs]

473
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,168
[in English] Hey, Lupin, Yuzuru.

474
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,036
[in English] Okay.

475
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,605
- [Tominaga in Japanese] Huh? Who's that?
- [Tsugimoto] Yuzuru Mayama.

476
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:59,877
By the way, this widely circulated photo
is from her middle school yearbook.

477
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,449
Hey, Lupin, generate an image of her
at 22 years old.

478
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,017
[Lupin] Understood.

479
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,056
[Tominaga] Whoa!

480
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,326
Lupin, summarize
Yuzuru Mayama's information.

481
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,427
[Lupin] Processing.

482
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,432
The cause of her isolation
was, of course, bullying.

483
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:27,305
Her father, Takafumi Mayama,
was a high-ranking official

484
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,042
in the prefectural board of education,
and yet his daughter became a shut-in.

485
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,345
That's all just stuff
you can read in the news.

486
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,849
Yeah, but this makes it
way more convenient.

487
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,417
For example...

488
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:43,287
Hey, Lupin, pull up data on Yuzuru's case.

489
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,490
[Lupin] Loading.

490
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,726
[blows]

491
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,229
[Tominaga] Wait, what is all this?
This is insane.

492
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,966
Hello, this is Mikami.

493
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,237
About that matter,
I was thinking of handling it tomorrow.

494
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:02,774
Yes.

495
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,044
Got it.

496
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,549
I want to become a prosecutor.

497
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,217
Seriously?

498
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,120
This whole thing is like
my shot at real-world training.

499
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,222
That's why I started investigating it.

500
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,457
Is that right?

501
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,392
If this is gonna be a long story,
I'm leaving.

502
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:27,365
Come on, let me pitch myself first.
First, there's this.

503
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,434
And this room.

504
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,971
You can use it whenever you want.

505
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,540
I don't need it.

506
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,444
Then how about this option?

507
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,214
I'm so incredibly talented

508
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,783
that I found something shocking.

509
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,418
What? Show me.

510
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,520
I'll show you
if he makes me his assistant.

511
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,824
Of course Kanzaki
will make you his assistant, Jigen!

512
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,959
Ugh, Tominaga, just go home already.

513
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,663
Sorry, I'm not leaving until I see it.

514
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,768
So, do we have a deal?

515
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,439
Guess I have no choice.

516
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,540
Yes!

517
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,343
[Tsugimoto] Now, quiz time!

518
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,714
What year did cell phones get cameras?

519
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,285
[Tominaga] Hmm, I think they already
had them when I was born.

520
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,956
[Tsugimoto] The correct answer is 1999.

521
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,460
And in 2001, when photos
could be attached to e-mails

522
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,264
they became explosively popular.

523
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,502
Is this "option" just a deep dive
into mobile device history?

524
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,972
Patience, my friend.

525
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,241
Then came 2002.

526
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,978
Anything significant comes to mind?

527
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,581
The year after 9/11?

528
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,416
Not sure.

529
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,060
Whoa...

530
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,664
If you dig deep enough into the internet

531
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:11,969
you find crime scene photos like this.

532
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,071
[suspenseful music playing]

533
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,181
[Makino] Mr. Nakaoka?

534
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,250
Oh, Mr. Makino.

535
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,719
What brings you here at this hour?

536
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,955
I have a date with Congressman Fujioka.

537
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,257
He calls me out
whenever he wants to see me.

538
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,992
Are you working on tomorrow's
National Diet preparations?

539
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,228
Yes, since the regular session
is wrapping up.

540
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,363
A bicycle, huh?

541
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,833
This is my hotline between
Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho.

542
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,502
It's the fastest way.

543
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,506
For delivering government documents,
this is the primary method.

544
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,874
So analog, isn't it?

545
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,411
Nagatacho insists
on handing everything in person.

546
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,051
- Nakaoka-san.
- Yes?

547
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,420
The next time you're free, can we meet?

548
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,688
Of course.

549
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,790
Preferably just the two of us...

550
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,293
Oh, a date?

551
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,929
I'd love that.

552
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,901
Let's make it a long-term thing.

553
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,704
See you soon.

554
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,382
[Tsugimoto] Ugh, I lost again!

555
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,252
- Hey.
- Pardon the intrusion.

556
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,686
Wasn't there one more person?

557
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,188
There was, but he left.

558
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,490
Want to stay for dinner?

559
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,727
Oh, I'm sorry, but I was just about to go.

560
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:47,765
- Oh, aren't you from the Tominaga family?
- Huh?

561
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,669
Oh, when you were in the first grade,
your mom and I were in the PTA together!

562
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,870
Oh, really?

563
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,140
Yeah, the other parents there
were so stuck-up.

564
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,276
I was so relieved to have your mom around.

565
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,279
Stop saying unnecessary things, Mom.

566
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,447
- Please come visit again.
- Of course.

567
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,985
- Thank you for having me.
- Of course.

568
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,120
- See you.
- See you.

569
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,322
[Tsugimoto's mom]
Hey, at least see her off.

570
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:16,160
[footsteps]

571
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,034
[breathing heavily]

572
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,011
Who is this?

573
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,616
You already know, don't you?

574
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,485
I want to hear it from you.

575
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,791
Twenty-two years ago

576
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,363
a boy made an announcement
over the school PA system.

577
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,967
Then he took his own life.

578
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,872
His death was so shocking
that it caused a huge uproar

579
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,176
with others even following
in his footsteps.

580
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,977
[suspenseful music playing]

581
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,513
The boy's name was Kota Mikami.

582
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,052
He was my older brother.

583
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,961
You saw it happen
when you were in middle school.

584
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,901
Yeah.

585
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:38,042
Why did you come to this school?

586
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,048
For revenge? Or...

587
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,383
I can't talk about it yet.

588
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,691
[tense music playing]

589
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,268
["Puppets Can't Control You"
by One OK Rock playing]

590
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,604
[machine beeps, whirs]

591
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,792
TO YUZURU

592
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,566
[distant chatter]

593
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,506
[students chatter]

594
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,088
Excuse me. Are you Takashi Mikami?

595
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,690
Do you have a moment?

596
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,060
It's about an article written
for the school newspaper...

597
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,035
[man] Sorry. We're open for business.
Could you all leave?

598
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,838
[reporter] If you answer our questions,
we'll leave.

599
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,174
You're disturbing the customers.
Please just leave.

600
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,576
When is she coming back?

601
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,744
We can't work like this.

602
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,116
[Mizohata] Reporters are already
showing up at school into the new year.

603
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,486
It's making the students uneasy.

604
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:33,457
Please be extra careful
not to stir things up further.

605
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,659
That's all. Thank you.

606
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,761
[all] Understood.

607
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,968
Was everything okay?

608
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,503
What do you mean?

609
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,271
Well, earlier...

610
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,606
Did something happen?

611
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,642
No, it's just... Mr. Mikami...

612
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,079
was approached by a reporter.

613
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,082
Is that true, Mr. Mikami?

614
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,918
Yes. They said they had received
the latest issue

615
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,019
of Kanzaki's newspaper.

616
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,554
You should have reported that immediately.

617
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,155
I was just about to.

618
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,459
In any case, matters like these
should go through the school.

619
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,561
I have his business card

620
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,063
so if necessary, we can formally protest.

621
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,469
Why does one thing after another
keep happening?

622
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,608
All right, meeting dismissed. Dismissed!

623
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,244
[chuckles] Why are we being dismissed?

624
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,681
There are only teachers here, right?

625
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,520
Is there anyone here
who has nothing to do with this issue?

626
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,621
You need to stop.

627
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,390
I've thought this for a while now.

628
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,627
Teachers are supposed
to set an example for students

629
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,631
but instead we just exchange glances
and wait for time to pass.

630
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:54,939
This school's motto
is "Self-Discipline," right?

631
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,209
Do the teachers not have to follow it?

632
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,078
- Stop it.
- Is there anyone here

633
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,348
who can honestly say,
"I have nothing to do with this"?

634
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,983
I said, stop!

635
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,985
You can't educate students
while shutting out opinions

636
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,253
you don't want to hear.

637
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,487
What did you say?

638
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,290
Mr. Mizohata, calm down.

639
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,692
[Kodai] Is there something wrong?

640
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,031
- Did something happen?
- No, sir.

641
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,132
Well...

642
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:29,340
You weren't being rude
to Mr. Mikami, were you?

643
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,977
Of course not.

644
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,645
Actually, this morning

645
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:38,082
a magazine reporter approached Mr. Mikami.

646
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,717
[machine beeps, whirs]

647
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,720
We were just discussing
how to handle that.

648
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,623
- Right?
- Yes.

649
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,525
- [woman] This...
- [man] What is this?

650
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,395
What's wrong?

651
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,034
"Rintoku is the country's blessed land.

652
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:02,272
So many have entered this land
through Hirakawa Gate.

653
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,276
I see your corruption.

654
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,679
Prince Yamato Takeru."

655
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,618
Hmm...

656
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,123
Someone sure went through
a lot of effort for this prank.

657
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,131
All right, everyone...
[clapping]

658
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,700
Back to work.

659
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,802
[ominous music playing]

660
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,417
[distant birds cawing]

661
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,307
[man] Can you hear me?

662
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,577
[woman] Maybe Takeru Yamato
symbolizes bureaucrats.

663
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,646
I thought Okami was nuts,
but his brother was something else.

664
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,216
[Mikami] If you believe
only your justice is right

665
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,517
you won't be able to talk to anyone.

666
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,653
Then why give
18-year-olds the right to vote?

667
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,988
[man 1] Please tell me the truth.

668
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,323
[man 2] We got played.

669
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,925
[man 3] Still, this is bad, Makino.

670
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,828
I won't let Mikami do whatever he wants.
