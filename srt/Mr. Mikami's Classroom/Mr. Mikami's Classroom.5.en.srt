1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,876
[young Mikami] Kota.

2
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,446
Kota.

3
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,649
Stop it, already.

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:18,852
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:20,987
The petition and stuff...

6
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,723
[Kota] Why?

7
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,292
My friends said...

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,632
"Your brother's been acting weird lately."

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,776
[Kota] I feel bad
for making you feel that way.

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,215
But still...

11
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,752
if I don't do it...

12
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,623
I won't be myself anymore.

13
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,258
[thumps]

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,163
Huh? Takashi, you're here?

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,266
Yeah, uh... yeah.

16
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,235
What, did I come in at an awkward time?

17
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,905
Wait, is it time for the lunch broadcast?

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,209
This is the list of songs I made
to play during lunch break.

19
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,378
- Have a listen.
- Okay.

20
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,979
- [Kota] Sounds good.
- Right?

21
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,382
- [Kota] Yeah.
- What about the order?

22
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,317
[crashing, electricity crackling]

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,057
[choral music playing]

24
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,632
PRINT

25
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,968
[printer whirring]

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,772
I AM THE ONE WHO BRINGS DOWN
THE KUSANAGI-NO-TACHI SWORD UPON

27
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,974
THOSE WHO ENTER THROUGH
THE HIRAKAWA GATE.

28
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,013
YOUR INJUSTICE WILL SOON BE EXPOSED
TO THE LIGHT OF DAY.

29
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,248
YAMATO TAKERU NO MIKOTO

30
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,584
[cicadas buzzing]

31
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,003
Um... if you're here
for visitation, it's up ahead.

32
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,774
No...

33
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm not.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,317
[woman] Number 86.

35
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,020
Yes.

36
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,456
[woman] She's not accepting
visitors today.

37
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,925
Please return the visitation slip.

38
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,093
[Tokumori] I'm against it.

39
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,194
What? Why?

40
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,862
A financial product?
It doesn't make sense!

41
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,030
Wait a second.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,166
What are you guys arguing about?

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,300
[Tokumori] Well, it's just...

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,235
Here. This.

45
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,670
BUSINESS PROJECT COMPETITION
FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

46
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,474
Oh, I see.

47
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,543
You're entering the Kahou
Foundation's business competition?

48
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,644
[Tokumori] Yes.

49
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,113
It's the biggest business contest
for high school students, right?

50
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,550
That's right.
We're aiming for the finals this time.

51
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,685
But then Fuyuki suddenly
started saying weird stuff.

52
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,387
He suddenly said,
"Let's do a financial product."

53
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,390
We're entering to get exempted
from the AO exam round one, right?

54
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,358
If we don't take risks,
then there's no point!

55
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,527
Sorry, but that idea won't win.

56
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,695
Stay out of it.

57
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,465
I'd like to hear why you think so.
Mr. Mikami, what is your reasoning?

58
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,902
Didn't you think it was strange
when you looked at past winners?

59
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,638
Yeah, there's a clear bias.

60
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,740
Is there perhaps favoritism by the adults?

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,044
The Kahou Foundation and the government...
Well, maybe you don't know.

62
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,446
I heard they're
practically glued at the hip.

63
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,016
[Mikami] Still, if you can come up
with an overwhelming idea

64
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,218
a miracle could happen.

65
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,386
Of course. That's the whole plan.

66
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,690
What's your idea, Fuyuki?

67
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,558
[Tokumori] It's this.

68
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,729
"A principal-protected fund
that lets high schoolers

69
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,598
learn to invest safely."

70
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,299
And you, Miyazawa?

71
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,668
I want to propose a product
development plan with

72
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,770
social contribution in mind.

73
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,472
[Mikami] Specifically?

74
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,775
Over summer break, I went on tours
of waste disposal companies

75
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,613
that focus on SDGs and companies
that make custom shoes for the elderly.

76
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,348
However, I couldn't come up
with any good ideas.

77
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,483
I see.

78
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,555
So, Fuyuki wants to make
financial products for high schoolers.

79
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,626
And you, Miyazawa, want to develop
products useful to society.

80
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,795
What do you think, Wakui?

81
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,432
[Wakui] They're both about the same.

82
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,836
Huh? What? Why do you say that, Wakui?

83
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,838
Please explain your reasoning.

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,307
First, about Fuyuki's idea.

85
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,076
"Principal-protected"
just isn't realistic.

86
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,313
Huh? But Fuyuki just said

87
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,282
it's the most popular
financial product now.

88
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:46,286
That's a financial product based on
investing in high-risk, high-return

89
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,720
overseas hedge funds.

90
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,523
Well, of course, the investment ratio
would need to be adjusted.

91
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,492
[Wakui] Did you actually
read the fund description?

92
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,228
This isn't something amateurs
like high schoolers can handle.

93
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,697
[Tokumori] Mr. Wakui, sir

94
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,967
I could barely understand
anything you just said!

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,202
Plus, you've got a guy
like this on your team.

96
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,470
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,472
See? That's why it's not feasible.

98
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,840
It's a business contest for high schoolers

99
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,243
so product development that
helps society is the safest bet.

100
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,645
[Wakui] But you don't have
anything solid yet

101
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,514
so that's a non-starter,
isn't it, Miyazawa?

102
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,818
Excuse me. Are we not having class?

103
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,887
Ah, sorry. Let's get started.

104
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,655
Okay, take your seats.

105
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,457
[Miyazawa] Yes.

106
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,896
Today, we are starting from page 193.

107
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:40,940
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

108
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,977
Hey, hey, hey. So about earlier...

109
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,214
- Can't you combine the two?
- Huh? Combine?

110
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,750
- Social contribution and finance.
- That's impossible.

111
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,085
You're always so quick
to say "impossible."

112
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,219
You're so rigid, Miyazawa.

113
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,255
So, you guys want me help you out?

114
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,058
You really stick your nose
into everything, don't you?

115
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,861
No, Tominaga's energy
is actually a huge asset!

116
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,329
Please help us.

117
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,565
Leave it to me! So, what should I do?

118
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,702
[indistinct chatter]

119
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,038
Shiiba, let's eat lunch on the rooftop.

120
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,441
- Yeah.
- [chuckles] Okay, let's go.

121
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,114
[Isshiki] Shiiba, from your class,
has been feeling unwell since spring.

122
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,583
But she still comes to school every day.

123
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,819
It's her period.
It seems to be hitting her hard.

124
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,055
Her period...?

125
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,424
Yes, it's been ongoing for a while.

126
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,459
I thought I should let you know.

127
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,862
Got it. Thank you.

128
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,164
Please watch over her.

129
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,835
[Koreeda] What about Yuzuru?

130
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,640
I went to the detention center
a few times over summer break.

131
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,043
But I couldn't see her.

132
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,379
I see.

133
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,651
I've sent her letters.

134
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,689
I hope she writes back.

135
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,761
I hope so too.

136
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,369
I'm home.

137
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,605
[mom] Takuto.

138
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,445
This letter came for you.

139
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,613
YUZURU MAYAMA

140
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,152
You'd be better off
not telling your father.

141
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:36,923
Thanks.

142
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,527
[tense music playing]

143
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,846
[Nakaoka] I heard about
the school festival.

144
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,716
[Makino] When the question came up
about whether textbook screening

145
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,486
is necessary or not, I thought,
"This is the end of Kyosuke Makino."

146
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,788
Was it really that bad?

147
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,058
If we're going to get scolded
from Nagatacho

148
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,826
it's usually over stuff like that.

149
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,195
I heard it was the students acting rashly.

150
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,530
That's right.

151
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,867
However...

152
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,202
I found this.

153
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,373
[Makino] This part where
they're to rearrange the exhibits

154
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,475
it says, "Plan Okami."

155
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,479
In other words,
it was Mikami's idea, right?

156
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,682
This seems like it might
come in handy in a pinch.

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,985
It does, doesn't it?

158
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,022
This is a conditional tense. Right here.

159
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,892
[laughs] Ah, yeah,
I think I've seen that before.

160
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:50,196
For stuff like this,
it's faster to just think in English.

161
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,132
[laughs] Okay, I got it.

162
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,336
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Mr. Mikami!

163
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,238
Isn't that student...

164
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:03,643
He's a freshman, but he hasn't
been able to attend school.

165
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,579
But he said he could come
if it's to the director's office

166
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,014
so we're letting him attend from there.

167
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,282
Really?

168
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,555
Even students who come to schools
like ours can experience things like this.

169
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,523
Education isn't always straightforward.

170
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,094
Ah! Please, right this way. Sorry.

171
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,598
So, what's this about?

172
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:30,570
Ah, it's about the Kahou Foundation's
business competition.

173
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,574
Winning that competition has been
a long-standing goal of this school.

174
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,378
So I hope our students
can really give it their all.

175
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,849
However, the theme...

176
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,520
I'd like you to guide them well on that.

177
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,621
[Mikami] The theme?

178
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:53,259
Given the school festival incident,
if it's too provocative...

179
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,362
We might get another
scolding from Kasumigaseki.

180
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,069
One of the competition judges
is from a think tank

181
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,404
under the Cabinet Office.

182
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,908
So depending on the content, we could
even get a warning from Nagatacho.

183
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,347
Of course, we value
student autonomy, but...

184
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,484
Understood. I'll be careful.

185
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,319
Thank you.

186
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,623
- [school bell chimes]
- That's all for today's class.

187
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,724
[students] Thank you.

188
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,593
Ms. Koreeda, do you invest?

189
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,128
Huh? That's random.

190
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,230
Team Miyazawa is entering
the business competition.

191
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,734
Yeah, I heard. Are they submitting
a finance-related plan?

192
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:39,271
Yes. It's a plan to connect financial
products with social contribution.

193
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,576
It's easy to think of ways
to use profit for social contribution.

194
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,278
But coming up with ideas
to profit through social contribution...

195
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,914
we're drawing blanks. Got any ideas?

196
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,820
Listen. Do I look like
the type of person who invests?

197
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,722
Huh? Then what about
your retirement savings?

198
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,659
A safe and steady fixed deposit account.

199
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,061
Nope, totally useless.

200
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,063
Then this is a great chance.
Ms. Koreeda, please listen.

201
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,164
Here goes.

202
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,869
Let's say you deposit
one million yen in a bank.

203
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,537
How long would it take to double?

204
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,173
Huh? I have no idea.

205
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,709
There's something called "The Rule of 72."

206
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,778
- Huh? Rule of 72?
- Yes.

207
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,380
[Miyazawa] The Rule of 72...

208
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,152
Even at banks offering
high fixed-deposit interest rates

209
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,554
the annual interest is around 0.5%.

210
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,655
That means?

211
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,625
To calculate how many years
it takes to double the principal

212
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,295
you divide 72 by the interest rate.

213
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:40,066
So if you divide 72 by 0.5...

214
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,436
it would take 144 years.

215
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,770
[Koreeda] What? Seriously?

216
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,642
[Mikami] The worse thing is major banks
have an annual interest rate of 0.0125%.

217
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,776
Seventy-two

218
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,912
- divided by 0.125...
-576 years.

219
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,880
Wow, I'll never retire.

220
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,782
Wait. When did Mr. Mikami show up?

221
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,284
You're talking about
the business competition, right?

222
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,954
[Mikami] Got any miraculous ideas,
Ms. Koreeda?

223
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,756
Cut me some slack here.

224
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,826
Anything finance-related
is out of the question for me.

225
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,562
[Mikami] Your family seems pretty good
at making money, though.

226
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,298
Which is exactly why I'm allergic to it.

227
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,800
- [Tominaga] That!
- Huh?

228
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,570
[Tominaga] I'd like to hear
why you're allergic to money.

229
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,971
As would I.

230
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,373
[Koreeda] I don't think I'll be much help.

231
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,609
[Tominaga] People who aren't helpful
are usually the most helpful.

232
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,078
- [Koreeda] That's harsh.
- Can we talk?

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,114
Of course, go ahead.

234
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,750
Not here, though.

235
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,253
[Miyazawa] Well, we need a plan that
appeals even to people who are reluctant.

236
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,421
about investing.

237
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,962
She said she'd meet me
if it's with you, Okami.

238
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,734
[Mikami] Aren't visits only allowed
on weekdays?

239
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,706
[Kanzaki] We're off one day next week for
the anniversary of the school's founding.

240
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,407
[Mikami] Oh, right.

241
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,749
I really don't want to
bow my head to you...

242
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,722
but I absolutely have to meet her.

243
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,262
Got it.

244
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,804
Thank you for your help.

245
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,473
[choral music playing]

246
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,418
[announcer] To the person with a visitor
number 16 on the 2nd floor

247
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,821
please proceed to the 2nd floor.

248
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,064
[choral music continues]

249
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,611
[door closes]

250
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,588
Hey, is this boy Kanzaki?

251
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,960
[Kanzaki] Yes.

252
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,398
You've got three seconds.

253
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,134
Then never get involved in my life again.

254
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,470
Why didn't you kill me?

255
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,807
[Mayama] Huh?

256
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,112
I'm the one who destroyed
your family. Not him.

257
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,949
[Mayama] I simply didn't know.

258
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,286
What?

259
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,726
I didn't know anything about
your newspaper until I got your letter.

260
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:02,301
Ms. Saejima never told you
about this paper.

261
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,770
THE AFFAIR BETWEEN TSUTSUI
AND SAEJIMA IS EXPOSED!

262
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,505
[Mikami] Right?

263
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,109
- [crashing]
- [man] Why a guy like him?

264
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,578
- [Saejima] I'm sorry...
- [crashing]

265
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,746
[man] Get out!

266
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,415
[Saejima] Please let me talk to Yuzuru.

267
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,150
- [slap echoing]
- [man] There's nothing to talk about!

268
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,086
[Saejima] Let me talk to Yuzuru!

269
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,189
[Kanzaki] If I wasn't the reason
you did what you did...

270
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,161
then was it revenge against your father?

271
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,402
Why the hell would I do that?

272
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,441
[Kanzaki] That was my reason.

273
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,445
What?

274
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,317
To get back at my journalist father

275
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,686
I exposed Ms. Saejima's scandal.

276
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,523
[Mayama] So?

277
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,460
I said your pathetic newspaper
had nothing to do with this!

278
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,029
It must have been tough.

279
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,498
Huh?

280
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,234
[Mikami] Being betrayed by the one person
you believed in, your mother.

281
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,670
Then you were left alone
in a house without her

282
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,806
constantly being berated by your father.

283
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,542
Shut up.

284
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,280
[Mikami] Considering his character,
there might've been violence too.

285
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,949
- So what?
- There's no way it wasn't painful.

286
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,721
You're seriously annoying! Shut up.

287
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,100
Kanako Shibutani... do you know her?

288
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,740
I met with her.

289
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,379
You met with Kanako Shibutani?

290
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
She asked me to tell you this.

291
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,856
I don't need to hear it!

292
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,997
[Kanzaki] "If you asked me
who I hate the most right now

293
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,503
without a doubt, I'd say Yuzuru Miyama.

294
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
As I sit in my son's empty room

295
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,841
all I do is pray you receive
the death penalty.

296
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,577
I'm alive, but it's like I'm already dead.

297
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:32,051
That's why I thought
I had nothing to say to you.

298
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,221
I just wished you would disappear.

299
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:44,263
But when Kanzaki asked if there
was anything I wanted to say...

300
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,768
I realized there was
something I had to tell you.

301
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,508
Through the newspapers and television

302
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,412
when I learned about the life you had led

303
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,385
I began to understand
why you did what you did.

304
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,455
I felt like I finally understood."

305
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,361
[Kanako] This is for good luck.
I hope you pass.

306
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
Thanks, Mom. Well, I'm off.

307
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,366
[Kanzaki] "Because where you were..."

308
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,668
Good luck!

309
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:28,974
[Kanzaki] "It was so much like the place
Yusuke and I had escaped from."

310
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,910
[somber cello music playing]

311
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,245
[tearfully] Stop.

312
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,951
[Kanzaki] "Yuzuru...

313
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,021
on the back of the person you killed

314
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,960
was a burn mark from the cigarette
his father put out on him.

315
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:00,606
I felt I really I needed to tell you this.

316
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,178
And while writing this letter

317
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:12,684
I can't help but wonder
why you ended up that way.

318
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,755
I don't want to think about it...

319
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,459
but I just can't stop thinking."

320
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,528
What are you, deaf? I said stop!

321
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,029
[Kanzaki] "And maybe I won't...

322
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,634
from now on, until forever.

323
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,104
Kanako Shibutani."

324
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,346
She's thinking.

325
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,985
She keeps thinking.

326
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:51,924
That's why...

327
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,595
there's no way we can justify giving up.

328
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,005
Who the hell do you think you are?

329
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,375
You're just a damn kid!

330
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,814
I'm not anybody.

331
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,122
You, me, we're both guilty!

332
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,893
[melancholic music playing]

333
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,838
[Mikami] In this one movie...

334
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,509
there was a luxury hotel that's
taken over by teenage terrorists

335
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,145
and the guests were killed,
one after another.

336
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,383
But during the massacre...

337
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,953
one of the teenage terrorists

338
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,890
ate some of the guests' leftover pizza.

339
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,264
It was likely his first pizza ever.

340
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,904
It was so delicious,
he laughed innocently.

341
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,943
Right in front of the bodies
of those he had just killed.

342
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,581
The truly evil people

343
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,884
weren't the ones in that hotel.

344
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,721
No, what was there...

345
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,760
was just a poor boy
who had never eaten pizza before

346
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:40,932
and tourists who happened to be there
with just a little more money than others.

347
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,336
The truly evil ones...

348
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,607
aren't even here.
Is that what you're trying to say?

349
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:01,253
But...

350
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,093
if I don't take responsibility...

351
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,031
I can't move forward.

352
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,669
I can't.

353
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,742
And neither can you, Yuzuru.

354
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,120
[Kanzaki] Yuzuru.

355
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,594
Do you really think
Ms. Saejima was having an affair?

356
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,538
I believe in her.

357
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,113
The Ms. Saejima I know...

358
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,886
would never do something like that.

359
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,857
[tense choral music playing]

360
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,936
[Mayama breathing heavily]

361
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,153
[paper rustling]

362
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:47,859
[door opens]

363
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,934
[choral music continues]

364
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,651
[door opens]

365
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,119
[birdsong]

366
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,655
[sighs]

367
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,568
[Miyazawa] There's no clear
disadvantages we can identify.

368
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,305
This is bad, we still haven't
submitted the documents.

369
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,809
[Tokumori] We've already written
a practical flow that could actually work.

370
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,345
No, this won't do.
At this rate, we'll fail on paper.

371
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,779
THREE WEEKS BEFORE BIZCON

372
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,416
Hey, Kurayoshi. You're studying
investment in America, right?

373
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,851
Got any good ideas?

374
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,655
They made us start from the basics,
but what I learned there was

375
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,424
basically stuff like "Let's do proper
research," that kind of thing.

376
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,127
[Tominaga] Hmm, I see.

377
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:34,633
But I think the proposal
you are trying to create is excellent.

378
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,702
Oh? Really? What exactly is good about it?
Please tell us.

379
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,139
In Europe and America,
for example, if companies

380
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,043
that invest in forest protection also
make products that cause air pollution

381
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,145
that contradiction gets them rejected.

382
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,747
But with this

383
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,850
you want to generate profit
while contributing to society, right?

384
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,951
Yes.

385
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,586
Yeah, I think that's a really sound idea.

386
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:59,558
So, what should we do to win?

387
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,728
Maybe you should try borrowing
everyone's wisdom?

388
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,829
[Tokumori] Huh?

389
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,266
Since you brought it up, Ms. Koreeda,
why don't you facilitate this discussion?

390
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,602
Oh! I'd love to give it a try.

391
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,038
May I?

392
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,947
The other day, while talking
with you guys, I realized something.

393
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,828
We're the ones turning this into money.

394
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,665
I mean, this is just
a piece of paper, right?

395
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,670
The reason we can buy things
with paper is because

396
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,142
we believe in the promise that it
will continue to be usable as money.

397
00:26:54,512 --> 00:27:00,552
Until now, I had always thought
money was something dirty.

398
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,954
But...

399
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,158
when I realized it's actually
a manifestation of trust

400
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:12,163
I felt like, "Wow, money
and humans are both amazing."

401
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,439
What is it that the BizCon team
wants to do now?

402
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,176
- Fuyuki.
- Huh? Me?

403
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,079
You're the one who
started this idea, right?

404
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,953
Everyone wants to know, right?

405
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:07,018
My father worked
at a foreign investment bank.

406
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,954
He was right in the middle
of the money game.

407
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,093
Why the past tense?

408
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,131
[Fuyuki] You've heard of
the Lehman Shock, right?

409
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah.

410
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,502
Well, after suffering
a huge loss from that...

411
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,174
the entire Japan branch ceased to exist.

412
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,780
Can you tell us what the Lehman Shock was?

413
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,930
In the early 2000s, there was
a housing boom in the US.

414
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,734
People who can't normally buy
a house are called "subprime."

415
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,704
It refers to people
with poor credit history.

416
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,274
So, even those low-income
individuals could take out a mortgage

417
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,044
if they were willing to pay
higher interest rates than normal.

418
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,347
That's what subprime loans were.

419
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,451
Since real estate prices were soaring,
even if these people couldn't repay

420
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,286
sell the house
and you get the money back, right?

421
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,522
That caught the attention of investors.

422
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,390
Huh? What do you mean?

423
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,261
In short, the subprime loans
themselves were turned into

424
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,363
investment products.

425
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,901
The interest paid by borrowers
became the return for investors.

426
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,804
It was promoted as
a "can't lose" investment product

427
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,607
and the market kept growing rapidly.

428
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,775
[student] I see.

429
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:41,379
[Fuyuki] But then, the housing bubble
burst and houses stopped selling.

430
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,849
And the funds that had
incorporated subprime loans

431
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,186
where Lehman Brothers
had invested heavily, started to decline

432
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,921
and they eventually went bankrupt.

433
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,827
That triggered a global financial freeze.

434
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,796
So that's the Lehman Shock.

435
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,299
[Shiiba] They took advantage
of the dreams of low-income people

436
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,501
who wanted to own homes
just to make money?

437
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,670
Scumbags.

438
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,874
[Fuyuki] That's what my father said too.

439
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,779
"Finance has forgotten
its true mission," he said.

440
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:22,854
He deeply regretted
becoming a living witness to that.

441
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,559
If we could create
a good financial product

442
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,694
he said, "I'd love to help."

443
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,100
To fulfill my father's wish...

444
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,470
I wanted to create a financial product.

445
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,577
Why did you keep something
so amazing to yourself?

446
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,613
Huh? If anything, why would I tell anyone?

447
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,615
[Tokumori] That's an important
thing to share!

448
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,751
Look! Look at Miyazawa's face!

449
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,886
[Miyazawa] Huh?

450
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,855
You were moved, weren't you?

451
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,057
You were totally moved
just now by Fuyuki's story.

452
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,758
[Miyazawa] Shut up, Tokumori! Be quiet!

453
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,929
When the Lehman Shock happened,
I was still just a baby, so I had no idea.

454
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,101
During summer break, when I told him
that I wanted to go into finance.

455
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,836
That's when he first told me the story.

456
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:14,973
That's why.

457
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,686
At first, I thought it would give us
an edge in the business contest

458
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,523
if we incorporated welfare
or social contribution.

459
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,859
But now you think differently?

460
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,263
[Miyazawa] That mindset
was shallow to begin with.

461
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,900
It's something we should
dedicate our lives to.

462
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,902
Using it just to get into college...

463
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,808
It's ultimately just
prioritizing our own gain.

464
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,613
After hearing Fuyuki's story

465
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:01,586
I clearly realized that I want to
create a financial product that

466
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,391
would help shape
the ideal society we envision.

467
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,695
[gentle piano music playing]

468
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,934
Please lend us your ideas!

469
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,538
Please help us!

470
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,210
[Kanzaki] Miyazawa, you already
said the answer at the start.

471
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,147
[Miyazawa] Huh?

472
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,784
You went on study tours
during summer break, right?

473
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,194
The waste management company
with the renewable system

474
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,929
and the custom shoes for elderly!

475
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,398
- [murmuring]
- Oh, I get it now.

476
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,302
We need to think about where to invest!

477
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,905
[Mikami] Yeah, that's it.

478
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:58,042
Not just allocating a portion
of returns to social causes

479
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,446
but creating a financial product
that itself contributes to society.

480
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,715
In other words

481
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,651
that might be what it means
to design society.

482
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,221
[upbeat music playing]

483
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,461
You guys can come up
with the rest yourself, right?

484
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,830
What?

485
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,566
Kanzaki, you're starting
to sound like Okami.

486
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,134
[laughter]

487
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,169
Huh? Oh, shut up.

488
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,373
[Tominaga] Hold on!
I think it's here! My moment!

489
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,075
Ready and...

490
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,777
- [all] Send!
- [clicks]

491
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,180
[all cheering]

492
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,952
[all chanting] Yes... yes!

493
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,655
Let's go, let's go!

494
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,592
[Tokumori] Everyone... everyone!

495
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,796
We have news about the high school
Business Project Contest.

496
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,365
We've officially made it
to the final round!

497
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,034
[cheering and applause]

498
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,470
It's actually a big deal. This is
the first time in our school's history.

499
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,574
[Tokumori] The final presentation
is this Saturday.

500
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,211
It's open to the public
and audience applause is important

501
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,413
so please come support us!

502
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,281
[both]
We look forward to seeing you there.

503
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,382
[applause]

504
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,483
Please!

505
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,018
We're counting on you!

506
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,655
You're coming this Saturday, right?

507
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,190
Wait, are you going, sir?

508
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,728
This BizCon is different from the others.

509
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,432
Rintoku's reputation will skyrocket.

510
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,671
We need to show that we're not
just a school focused on exams.

511
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,443
I really want to make this happen.

512
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,749
- Are you going, Makino?
- What, you too, Tsubuki?

513
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,087
Mr. Tsukada is freaking out,
thinking it might upset Nagatacho.

514
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,721
Well...

515
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:55,593
Team Mikami might say something
to challenge the government.

516
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,628
That's why Mr. Tsukada
is being so cautious.

517
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,398
Yeah, if they do something like that

518
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,367
it'll get leaked straight to
the Cabinet Personnel Bureau.

519
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,537
It would seriously affect the appointment
of the next administrative vice minister.

520
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,873
Exactly. The countdown
to Tsukada's big debut

521
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,043
as vice minister
is now shrouded in uncertainty.

522
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,746
Wow! Mikami is amazing, isn't he?

523
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,348
Yeah.

524
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,352
He's somehow started
winning over the students' hearts.

525
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,556
[Hayato] He's got that secretly lovable
bomb built-in, after all.

526
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,492
Seriously.

527
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,929
[scoffs] So annoying.

528
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,498
[ominous music playing]

529
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,099
[whirring]

530
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,544
- Oh no!
- What?

531
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,046
That bureaucrat suspected of shady
post-retirement job placement...

532
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,115
- Yeah.
- There's an update on that.

533
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,988
Mikami.

534
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,327
Making it to the finals is impressive!

535
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,529
I didn't do anything.

536
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,398
Oh, come on. You're probably
pulling strings behind the scenes.

537
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,101
It's a fascinating topic, right?
High schoolers and finance.

538
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,538
You're not suddenly going to pull
something like the school festival

539
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,772
again, are you?

540
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,909
That would be a serious rule violation
and a huge problem.

541
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,211
It could even destroy
the AO entrance system.

542
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,479
No way that would happen.

543
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,248
Why, hello! Everyone's gathered, I see.

544
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,284
Mr. Nakaoka, long time no see.

545
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,586
- You look great.
- Thanks to you, sir.

546
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,021
I hear you're a judge today.

547
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,891
Yes, believe it or not,
I work as consultant for startups.

548
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,928
Please look after our students.

549
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,531
Just so you know, I don't play favorites.

550
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:41,899
Of course not!

551
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,336
I know very well
how strict you are about that.

552
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,140
By the way, do you know
where the competition HQ is?

553
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,409
- Shall I take you there?
- I'd appreciate it

554
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,510
[Mikami] This way, please.

555
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,446
[announcer] Thank you to everyone
from Katsuragi Mirai Academy!

556
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,049
[applause]

557
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,585
[woman] It looks like it's a win
for Katsuragi Mirai, huh?

558
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,654
Wait, did you give them advice,
Mr. Nakaoka?

559
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,792
No, I'd never.
That would be like insider trading.

560
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,328
[woman] Oh, come now. [laughs]

561
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,798
Now, next up is "The Support Fund
for the Future Enterprises

562
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,900
Dreamed of by High School Students."

563
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,071
[announcer] A finance-related topic?
Sounds fascinating!

564
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,307
And now, making their first
appearance as a finalist

565
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,344
please welcome the students
from Rintoku Gakuin High School!

566
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,313
[applause]

567
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:34,518
The participants are Ryo Miyazawa,
Ryuichiro Fuyuki, Jin Tokumori

568
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,556
and Aoi Tominaga from Class 3-2.

569
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:43,461
Let's see what kind of presentation
Rintoku Gakuin has in store for us.

570
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,731
Please begin.

571
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,133
[applause]

572
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,383
LEHMAN SHOCK

573
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,386
I'm sure everyone has
heard this term before.

574
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,357
But do you actually know what happened?

575
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,730
[Miyazawa] In the 1980s, brilliant
physicists and mathematicians entered

576
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,932
the financial world

577
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,303
and used computers
to create financial products.

578
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:32,176
The amount of time for that
to happen is a staggering 576 years.

579
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,512
[audience murmuring]

580
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,915
Living modestly
with certificates of deposits

581
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,286
is also taken from us by the Rule of 72.

582
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,658
Now, learning finance is mandatory
even for high schoolers.

583
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,862
With policy interest rates
and wages at rock-bottom

584
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:56,367
among developed countries, we've
been left to figure it out on our own.

585
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,770
Japan's national debt
exceeds one quadrillion yen.

586
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,074
If the country ever goes
bankrupt in the future...

587
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,011
we can't say for sure that
deposit freezes won't happen.

588
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,780
That's the reality we're facing.

589
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,017
[Miyazawa] So we high schoolers
want to show the adults

590
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,120
the original power of finance.

591
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,525
This is a proposal for a solid,
but socially impactful, financial product

592
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:26,630
where high school students
save a small amount monthly.

593
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,972
Our fund begins by openly recruiting
companies we want to invest in.

594
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:38,442
From those, we high schoolers,
along with the help of experts

595
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,145
will choose the companies
we think should exist in the future

596
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,481
and designate them as investment targets.

597
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,949
Through our investment

598
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,919
the companies we want to preserve
for Japan's future will grow.

599
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,354
That's the first win.

600
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:57,061
Then, a portion of the profits
will be used to support education

601
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,430
in regions where access
to learning is limited.

602
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,999
[Tominaga] The returns
are not used for personal gain

603
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,168
but directed toward social contribution.

604
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,036
That's the second win.

605
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,242
And the rest is distributed
to investors as return.

606
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,715
By investing, we get to
experience how our own money

607
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,350
- helps make society better.
- [watch buzzes]

608
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,318
That's the third win.

609
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,456
[Fuyuki] My father works in finance.

610
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,859
When he heard this plan, he said...

611
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,796
"That's a fund that

612
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,468
can help us financial professionals
regain our pride."

613
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,440
Unexpectedly, we even gained a fourth win.

614
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,950
Now is not the time
for financial professionals

615
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,718
to be getting back at each other.

616
00:40:55,386 --> 00:41:01,559
Neither school nor financial dramas
teach us the true meaning of finance.

617
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:07,231
The true meaning of finance is...

618
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,138
trust and mutual support.

619
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:22,980
Money is what trust looks like
in physical form.

620
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,784
[emotional music playing]

621
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:32,122
[Fuyuki] We wanted to return
to the very origins of finance.

622
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,858
That is how we came up with this plan.

623
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,529
To question the true meaning of investment

624
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,130
that adults have forgotten...

625
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,367
[Miyazawa] To create a future
through financial investment...

626
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,104
that's the business plan we came up with.

627
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,076
That concludes our presentation.

628
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,749
[applause]

629
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,987
[uplifting music playing]

630
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:04,154
[camera clicks]

631
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,265
[announcer] Wow!
What a fantastic presentation!

632
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,000
Here, I'm finalizing my scores.

633
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,868
Wait. What about deliberations?

634
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,339
Is there even a need
for rankings beyond this?

635
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,774
Yes, but...

636
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,444
For me, my job is based on trust.

637
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,981
I'll be back before the results
are announced. Excuse me.

638
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,053
We won!

639
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,522
[cheering and applause]

640
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,991
- Congratulations!
- [Tominaga] Thank you so much!

641
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,393
You're crying too much.

642
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,161
[Miyazawa] Mr. Mikami!

643
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:47,064
- [Mikami] Good job out there.
- Thank you!

644
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,233
This victory was only possible
because of you, Mr. Mikami!

645
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,769
I didn't do anything.
It was a team effort.

646
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,305
Ms. Koreeda, thank you so much as well.

647
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,406
[Koreeda] That was truly amazing.

648
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,909
Wow, look at them crowding around Mikami.

649
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,778
[Hayato] He's totally become a star.

650
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,647
I can't believe they actually won.

651
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,984
Maybe it's just me, but...

652
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,388
I think Mr. Mikami was crying a bit.

653
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,726
No way! Probably just some dust
or something got in his eye.

654
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,394
[chuckles] Yeah, probably.

655
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,298
Right, we're planning to celebrate
at that restaurant just over there.

656
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,400
Mr. Mikami and Ms. Koreeda,
would you like to come?

657
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,803
You go ahead. I need to
stop by the admin office first.

658
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,172
Okay, then let's go, Miss Koreeda.

659
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,673
Yeah! Let's go!

660
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,777
- Today, it's my treat!
- Yay!

661
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,247
[tense music playing]

662
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,479
[dramatic rock music playing]

663
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,858
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

664
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,026
[Mikami] What is it?

665
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,731
Yesterday, I heard from my dad.

666
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,436
Tomorrow, your brother's case...

667
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:35,973
it's going to be in a magazine.

668
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,510
[Mikami] I see.

669
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,582
What are you going to do?

670
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,685
Nothing.

671
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,522
Nothing?

672
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:58,462
It's... already over.

673
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,101
It's not over, is it?

674
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,272
If I were you...

675
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,744
I wouldn't be able to move on that easily.

676
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,753
I...

677
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,925
I'm okay now.

678
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,664
So next...

679
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,632
it's your turn.

680
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:37,968
[music ends]

681
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,808
[Sakurai] Maybe it's you who still
can't think of it as something

682
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,276
from 20 years ago.

683
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,279
[man 1] Please tell me the truth.

684
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,883
If I tell you, I'll stop being
even a former teacher.

685
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,852
[Mikami] There's definitely a connection.

686
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,587
And yet we still can't
get any solid evidence.

687
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,689
[man 2] We have to show them
that it's not so easy.

688
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,057
[Mikami] I want to talk to you
