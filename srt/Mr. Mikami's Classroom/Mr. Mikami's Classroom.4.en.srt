- [man] Can you hear me?

[panting]

10
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,365
Excuse me.

11
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,135
Have you seen Saejima-san?

12
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,704
It seems she moved.

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,606
Do you know where she is now?

14
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,408
How the hell should I know?

15
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,944
Regardless, it's got nothing
to do with us.

16
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,586
Ms. Koreeda.

17
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,029
[Koreeda] It seems Ms. Saejima
has disappeared.

18
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,933
Kanzaki came to ask if I knew anything.

19
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,802
So you don't know either?

20
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,606
No. It looks like Ms. Isshiki
hasn't heard from her either.

21
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,511
I'm worried about Kanzaki.

22
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,882
[somber music playing]

00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:07,861
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

24
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,531
[Tominaga] Tazune,
your dad's textbooks are amazing.

25
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,567
Especially parts like this.

26
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,004
[Tominaga] "All right.
Close your textbooks and think."

27
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:21,007
You can't move on
until you've really thought it through.

28
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:28,748
Dad always said studying is meaningless

29
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,450
unless you think about it.

30
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,821
That's like what Okami says too.

31
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,856
Huh?

32
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,827
Sorry if this makes you uncomfortable.

33
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:43,763
But, you know

34
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,667
I think in his own way,
Okami is worried about you.

35
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,504
I also think he feels
some sense of responsibility.

36
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,876
I haven't quite processed that yet.

37
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,848
I see.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,089
Actually, I have something I want to do.

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,992
Can you help me, Tominaga?

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,298
[light music playing]

41
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,104
Welcome.

42
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,075
This way please.

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,147
I'm sorry you had to pick the place,
even though I asked to meet.

44
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,950
No problem.
I prefer meeting in a place I trust.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,818
I'm just a cautious person.

46
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,588
Do you come here often?

47
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,590
People have started to figure out
they can find me here

48
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,658
so I think it may be time for a change.

49
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,761
[chuckles]
It must be tough being so popular.

50
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,831
So, what's this about?

51
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,301
There's nothing urgent.

52
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,104
I just think we need a system
where we can talk

53
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,739
without Mr. Tsukada.

54
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,308
I appreciate that.

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,578
I need support.

56
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,884
As you know, Tsukada
values his position dearly.

57
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,523
From here on, I'll have to be
the one taking on the dirty work.

58
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,928
I'd really like to have
your help, Mr. Nakaoka.

59
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,365
RINTOKU FESTIVAL

60
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,734
- May I have your attention for a moment?
- [indistinct chatter]

61
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,269
[chatter stops]

62
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,039
For the upcoming Rintoku Festival

63
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,174
I want to organize an independent project.

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,343
Huh? What kind of project?

65
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,881
I want to research and display information
about textbook screenings.

66
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,352
Here's the proposal.
Can you pass it around?

67
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,322
Seniors are supposed to be studying
on their own. Is this okay?

68
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,857
Participation is voluntary

69
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,325
so the school
shouldn't be able to stop us.

70
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,394
I doubt they'll approve
something like this.

71
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,829
At least take a look at it first.

72
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,933
- I don't want any trouble.
- Same here.

73
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,103
- I'll do it.
- You're joking, right, Wakui?

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,807
Private school students
usually don't participate

75
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,176
but there are other schools where they do.

76
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,180
If anyone else is interested,
just let us know.

77
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,216
[school bell chimes]

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,886
[Tsugimoto] Tominaga,
you need me for this, don't you?

79
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,388
- It's mandatory for you, Jigen.
- Roger that.

80
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,891
- Hey, Sora Ihara.
- Huh? What?

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,893
- It's mandatory for you too.
- Wait, I gotta join too?

82
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,395
- Hatano, what about you?
- Of course, I'll be studying.

83
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,730
Yeah, that's understandable.

84
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,400
[indistinct chatter]

85
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,777
- [door opens]
- [Mikami] Good morning.

86
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,146
[students] Good morning.

87
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,556
[Fuyuki] Mr. Mikami,
please start the lesson.

88
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,657
Huh? What?

89
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,426
I sensed you were about
to start talking about "that" topic.

90
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,595
Of course, I came here to teach.

91
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,997
[inhales deeply]
All right, today's lesson...

92
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,635
If you're just copying something down

93
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,839
you could just take a picture
with your phone and be done with it.

94
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:18,411
But if you're writing it
while thinking about possible mistakes

95
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,446
it naturally sticks in your mind.

96
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,550
Which probably connects to this, but...

97
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,319
Please don't get involved
in the contents of that.

98
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,688
All right, then without touching upon
the content, I'll say just one thing.

99
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,759
With this plan, you probably won't get
permission to use this classroom.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,697
Is it okay to use class time
just to push your own ideas?

101
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,734
That wasn't my intention.
But it's such an interesting topic.

102
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,973
- Kurayoshi.
- Huh? Me?

103
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,477
Yeah. In America,
how do they teach about the atomic bomb?

104
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,848
Uh...

105
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,119
- Is it hard to say?
- Of course it is.

106
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,788
Then should I say it?

107
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,656
No, I'll say it.

108
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,325
I want to say it.

109
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,528
Go ahead.

110
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,834
Uh...

111
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,703
In America...

112
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,139
they teach that
the atomic bombings were...

113
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,311
unavoidable.

114
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,847
- Huh?
- [students gasping, murmuring]

115
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,515
That's ridiculous.

116
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,785
The US had already warned Japan
that if we continued the war

117
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,489
they would launch a devastating attack.

118
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,026
In other words, drop the atomic bomb.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,528
So what if they warned us?

120
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,935
The textbooks say
the US president at the time stated...

121
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,541
"If the war continues like this,
a mainland battle will be inevitable."

122
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,779
"To prevent further sacrifices
of American youth

123
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,550
the atomic bomb was unavoidable."

124
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,519
That's insane.

125
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,621
That's what the textbook says.

126
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,225
However, it also asks...

127
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,230
"Do you think
the president's opinion was correct?"

128
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,334
"Explain your opinion and reasoning."

129
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,904
What did you answer?

130
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,113
I couldn't.

131
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:39,485
What? Unbelievable.
You're Japanese, aren't you?

132
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,489
Everyone was looking at me, just like now.

133
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,961
I had no deep knowledge,
and as someone raised in America

134
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,265
I felt like whatever I said
would be taken as the opinion

135
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,700
of all Japanese people. I was scared.

136
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,570
So, I couldn't answer.

137
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,547
Now, I think I could answer
a little better.

138
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,650
What would you say?

139
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,254
Japan should have ended the war sooner

140
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,991
and America still shouldn't
have dropped the bomb.

141
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,995
In other words, both were wrong.

142
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,630
[Mikami] Why?

143
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:30,770
In Okinawa,
countless civilians lost their lives.

144
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,040
That number alone
should have been enough for Japan

145
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,043
to realize they needed to end the war.

146
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,978
[Mikami] What about America?

147
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,584
People say the atomic bomb
was unforgivable

148
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,522
because it instantly took so many lives.

149
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:56,429
But I kept wondering,
was it really just about the numbers?

150
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,065
I struggled with that question a lot.

151
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:06,572
But in the end, a bomb that destroys cells

152
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:12,244
and causes decades-long health issues
should never have been used.

153
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,748
That's true.

154
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,387
That's why, in future lessons

155
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,525
I want both sides
to be acknowledged as being wrong.

156
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,739
What are you trying to do...

157
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,610
making Kurayoshi say all that,
digging up her past trauma?

158
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:49,448
Do you even realize
how sensitive this topic is?

159
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,885
- Of course I do.
- You heard Kurayoshi, right?

160
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,758
There are textbooks
that justify the atomic bombings.

161
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,094
Because to that country, that was just.

162
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,698
And like that, every nation
and every person has their own justice.

163
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:11,170
If you believe only your justice is right,
you won't be able to talk to anyone.

164
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,141
Then what should I do?

165
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,809
Do you want me to give you instructions?

166
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:20,946
You don't, right?

167
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,850
Tazune?

168
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,453
You know.

169
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,489
It's not a traumatic experience.

170
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,525
Huh?

171
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,462
Because it almost became one,
I studied hard on the topic.

172
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,765
When I found out
I was moving back to Japan

173
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,967
I spoke with my classmates.

174
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,703
I told them...

175
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:48,774
"I love you all and I never, ever
want to go to war with you."

176
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,645
What did they say?

177
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,048
They agreed.

178
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:01,120
They said, "No matter what happens,
we should never press the nuclear button."

179
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,523
And so I answered,
"I promise to uphold Japan's principle

180
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,827
of not possessing nuclear weapons."

181
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,962
I talked about it properly with them.

182
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,565
That's why it's not traumatic.

183
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,205
However, when I came back to Japan

184
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,641
it became something
we couldn't even talk about.

185
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,944
For me, that was even harder.

186
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,787
So, Tazune...

187
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,024
I'm grateful.

188
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,065
I want to participate.

189
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,339
[school bell chiming]

190
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,341
That's the end of today's lesson.

191
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,844
[school bell chiming]

192
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,046
Kanzaki, you're not doing it?

193
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,716
I'm good.

194
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,486
- Why?
- I have other things to do.

195
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,057
[Koreeda] Is it about Ms. Saejima?

196
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,594
Have you found anything out since then?

197
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,332
No. Her email isn't working

198
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,868
and it looks like she canceled her phone.

199
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,011
I think she's seriously trying
to focus on her daughter.

200
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,584
Even so...

201
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,955
I can't just leave things like this.

202
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,792
Are you okay?

203
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,596
[soft music playing]

204
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,968
If I hear anything,
I'll tell you right away.

205
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,571
Let me know if anything
comes up on your end too.

206
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,541
Okay.

207
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,232
[Mizohata] What's the meaning of this?

208
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,567
Is there something wrong?

209
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,304
I already explained that as a rule,
seniors don't participate.

210
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,173
And this theme...

211
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,042
I actually mentioned it to the director

212
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,313
and he said it was wonderful
and should definitely be done.

213
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,949
Let me make sure.

214
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,323
A WEEK BEFORE THE RINTOKU FESTIVAL

215
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,158
Mr. Mikami.

216
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,994
- Yes?
- Can I talk to you for a moment?

217
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,162
What is it?

218
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,266
What do you mean by that?

219
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,001
Exactly what I said.

220
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,038
The classroom permission might be revoked.

221
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,439
Why?

222
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,341
Because topics
with strong political themes

223
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,076
aren't suitable
for a high school festival.

224
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,678
Here we go again.

225
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,981
Then why give
18-year-olds the right to vote?

226
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,485
But isn't this strange?
They already approved it once.

227
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,687
It's only natural for it to be revoked.

228
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,156
[Shinonome] Why?

229
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,959
I was honestly shocked
they approved it in the first place.

230
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,395
But...

231
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,866
What does everyone else think?

232
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:46,145
At first, I thought it was fine
since it was voluntary.

233
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,581
But honestly, it's exhausting.

234
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,017
Exhausting?

235
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,487
I don't even have a place
to study during lunch anymore.

236
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,225
Anything else?

237
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:08,367
I kept getting asked,
"You're not participating, right?"

238
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,002
And it was tough.

239
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,038
Yeah, it felt like the people not joining
were being looked down on

240
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,008
as if we only care about entrance exams.

241
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,713
[school bell chiming]

242
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,726
All right, let's start homeroom.
I have a suggestion.

243
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,229
Let's hold a debate.

244
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,531
Since there are different opinions

245
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,334
before we protest
the classroom permission issue

246
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,236
we should think it through first.

247
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,775
The topic is, "Are you for
or against having an exhibition

248
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,644
about textbooks at our school festival?"

249
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,316
What do you think?

250
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,390
We should do it.

251
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,259
[Mikami] All right, let's try it.

252
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,628
Sakurai will represent the pro side

253
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,563
and Shinonome will represent the con side.

254
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,033
Huh? Why?

255
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,669
Debates aren't about stating
your personal opinion.

256
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,973
The pro side presents their reasoning

257
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,809
and the con side presents theirs.

258
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,612
Okay, let's move the desks around.

259
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,391
Let's start with the pro side. Sakurai.

260
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,669
Some people don't ever know
that textbooks go through

261
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,706
an approval process,
or that their use is mandatory.

262
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,744
Many also don't know that few countries
have a textbook screening system.

263
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:04,516
Understanding the foundation
of our learning is meaningful.

264
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,352
That's why I support the exhibition.

265
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,488
[Mikami] Shinonome, now for the con side.

266
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,960
The con side must base their argument
on the pro side's points.

267
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,402
Seniors don't participate
in the festival in the first place

268
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,405
so they can focus on exams.

269
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,075
Moving forward without class consensus

270
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:35,681
infringes on the rights of students
who want to focus on studying.

271
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:41,286
That's why I'm against it.

272
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,927
Now, let's move on to the discussion.

273
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,697
Sakurai, go ahead.

274
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,072
This is Article 34, Section 1
of the School Education Act.

275
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,742
"Textbooks approved
by the Minister of Education

276
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,677
Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology

277
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,716
or textbooks for which the ministry
holds authorship rights must be used."

278
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,824
However, the latest
curriculum guidelines emphasize

279
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,793
individualized learning,
which means tailoring education

280
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,596
to each student's understanding.

281
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,634
That contradicts the use
of a single common textbook.

282
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,805
Shouldn't we use this exhibition
to think about that contradiction?

283
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,307
I'm in favor.

284
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,479
Wow, you really researched this.
That's impressive.

285
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,922
The School Education Act
is the foundation of education.

286
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,527
If we start questioning it,
the entire system will collapse.

287
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,130
I am against it.

288
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,142
I looked into Shinonome's father's class.

289
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,411
- Huh?
- What?

290
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,218
Many of his students
went on to top-tier high schools.

291
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:26,491
According to newspaper articles,
graduates spoke highly of him

292
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,962
saying his rich lessons
taught them the joy of learning.

293
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,567
Despite that, he lost his job
for violating curriculum guidelines.

294
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,104
That was a great loss to education.

295
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,408
Isn't that worth thinking about?

296
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,089
I believe this project should be done.

297
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,902
I have no response to...

298
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,907
Sakurai's words.

299
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,547
It has been three years
since my parents divorced

300
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,317
and I did nothing.

301
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,357
I never even tried to learn
what my father was doing at school.

302
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:15,334
I have no right
to direct my anger at Mr. Mikami.

303
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,975
Someone like me...

304
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:32,617
shouldn't be leading a project like this.

305
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,760
That is why I am against it.

306
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,543
[somber music playing]

307
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,817
The pro side supported the project
for its educational value.

308
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,689
The con side opposed it
due to the lack of consideration

309
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,492
for those who wanted to focus on studying

310
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,160
and the exclusion felt
by non-participants.

311
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,930
I think we can see what needs to be done.

312
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,971
Oh, right. I got an internal update today.

313
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,907
A deputy minister
from the Ministry of Education

314
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,710
Takizawa, politician,
will be visiting the festival.

315
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,412
- What? Seriously?
- Yes.

316
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,381
If the government finds out
that we conducted an exhibition

317
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,683
about textbook screening,
it could cause problems.

318
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,819
- So that's why they stepped in?
- Probably.

319
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,123
What do we do?

320
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,263
That means the person
who needs to see it most is coming, right?

321
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,233
I want to do it.

322
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,641
Then discuss the rest among yourselves.

323
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,580
- Let's talk, everyone.
- Yeah, where should we start?

324
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,349
[male student]
How about an opinion exchange first?

325
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,517
[female student] Exactly.

326
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,119
[indistinct chatter]

327
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,220
Hey.

328
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,394
I just have a habit
of researching legal matters.

329
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,529
That's all.

330
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,065
Thank you. It meant a lot.

331
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,537
FIVE DAYS BEFORE THE RINTOKU FESTIVAL

332
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,574
Mr. Mizohata, do you have a moment?

333
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,776
Ah, about that.

334
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,311
Are you withdrawing?

335
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,748
No, I want to proceed.

336
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,119
So we revised the project.

337
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,164
- You changed it quite a bit.
- Yes.

338
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,467
I'll review it and get back to you.

339
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,703
Thank you.

340
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,638
[Tominaga] Hey, Kanzaki.

341
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,374
Are you not coming to the school festival?

342
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,277
I have plans.

343
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,512
Are you just being stubborn?

344
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,515
There are things
I can only do on weekdays.

345
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,316
You've heard, right?

346
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,752
They say the exhibition
was approved using a fake proposal.

347
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,623
Can you believe it?

348
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,826
That goody-goody Tazune
would do something like that.

349
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,829
[Wakui] Oh, that's a huge help. Thanks.

350
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,734
I think there's something you need to do
as editor of the school paper.

351
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,110
[Tsugimoto] Kanzaki,
you're not joining the school festival?

352
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,079
- Tominaga keeps bugging me to cover it.
- Ah.

353
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,649
Oh, I have an update on Kota Mikami.

354
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:52,417
What is it?

355
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,085
Hey, Lupin, pull up yesterday's data.

356
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,186
[Lupin in English] Okay!

357
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,292
[Tsugimoto in Japanese]
I found a thread on 2channel.

358
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,162
[chuckles]

359
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:09,267
Digital footprints.
They are all still there.

360
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,040
I thought Okami was nuts,
but his brother was something else.

361
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,576
This guy was seriously hardcore.

362
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,083
Do you have a moment?

363
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,618
Yes, what is it?

364
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,060
There was a checkpoint
built to defend against

365
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,595
the Emishi invasion by Takeru Yamato.

366
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,897
It was located in...

367
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,401
Kasumigaseki.

368
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,870
KASUMIGASEKI

369
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:50,842
So maybe Takeru Yamato
symbolizes bureaucrats.

370
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,347
Are you Takeru Yamato, Mr. Mikami?

371
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,115
- No.
- But...

372
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,017
- Are you done?
- No, not yet.

373
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:00,885
Hirakawa Gate...

374
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:07,392
It's directly opposite
Sakurada Gate in Kasumigaseki.

375
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,261
It is said to be the back gate
of Edo Castle.

376
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,599
In other words, many people
entered Rintoku through the back entrance.

377
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,168
[foreboding music playing]

378
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,403
I see.

379
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,006
And "Rintoku is the country's Mahoroba."

380
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,575
This is a parody
of Takeru Yamato's farewell poem.

381
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:27,479
Originally, it was,
"Yamato is the country's Mahoroba."

382
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,349
Which means,
"Yamato is the country's paradise."

383
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,451
If you write "Mahoroba"
using Chinese characters...

384
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,729
Notice something?

385
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,732
The name of the former chairman.

386
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,169
It uses the same characters,
but is read as "Masahide."

387
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,075
[Tsukada] About Deputy Minister
Takizawa's visit to Rintoku...

388
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,977
Makino, can you accompany him?

389
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,812
Yes, gladly.

390
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,583
[gasps]

391
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,819
Wow, this is incredible.

392
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,155
A Deputy Minister
coming for a school inspection?

393
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,025
That's how much attention
this high school is getting.

394
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,662
The school festival also draws
a huge crowd from the community.

395
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,030
So it seems.

396
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:24,102
Mr. Takizawa was quite fond of Mikami.

397
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:33,344
Make sure he doesn't get embarrassed.

398
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,715
Understood, sir.

399
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,318
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE RINTOKU FESTIVAL

400
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,254
[indistinct chatter]

401
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,525
Mr. Mikami.

402
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,263
The dummy proposal
has been officially approved.

403
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,932
Is that right? I'm glad.

404
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,702
However, the school will conduct
an inspection the day before.

405
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,605
Well, that's to be expected.

406
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:05,376
Shinonome, I heard you spoke
with every classmate individually?

407
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,078
Yes.

408
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,780
How did it go?

409
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,549
Those who aren't participating

410
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,253
said they respect the freedom
of those who are.

411
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,891
And a few more people decided to join.

412
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,327
I see.

413
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,234
This is the actual project proposal.

414
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,240
This is a great theme.

415
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,709
"Seeing the World Through Textbooks."

416
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:39,878
I like it.

417
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,253
Kurayoshi's words
made me realize something.

418
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:54,659
Japanese people tend to blur
their themes too quickly.

419
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,865
But themes are meant
to be something you always return to.

420
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,700
Like "The Power to Live."

421
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,369
Yes.

422
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,872
If that's a pillar
of the curriculum guidelines

423
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,009
then the entire content
should be restructured.

424
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,677
That's how heavy a concept it is.

425
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:18,883
But instead,
they just patch things together

426
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,852
which makes everything inconsistent.

427
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,588
Wow, that's a harsh truth.

428
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,324
I'd love for the Ministry of Education
to hear this.

429
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,829
I'm determined to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

430
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,768
Here's the progress plan.
Could you review it?

431
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,869
[Mikami] Sure.

432
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,907
It's a good idea.

433
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,012
But if it were me...

434
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,288
I'd do it like this instead.

435
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,700
Mr. Mikami, lure the rat into the trap.

436
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,902
Got it.

437
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,206
THE DAY BEFORE THE RINTOKU FESTIVAL

438
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,141
- Is over here okay?
- Yeah, put it there.

439
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,150
[indistinct chatter]

440
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:31,422
ENTRANCE FOR VISITATION
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER

441
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,601
[jail officer] Number 133.

442
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,171
Yes.

443
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,541
Yuzuru Mayama has refused the visit.

444
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:59,317
What should I do?

445
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,086
[jail officer] The only way
is to confirm her intentions by letter.

446
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,168
[uneasy music playing]

447
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,007
[Kanzaki] Are you able to meet with her?

448
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,787
You had to move, didn't you?

449
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,189
It's fine.

450
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,659
I was planning to move closer
to here anyway.

451
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,665
I told you to forget about it, didn't I?

452
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,637
I can't. That's why I'm struggling.

453
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:04,649
I turned 18 yesterday.

454
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,222
I see.

455
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,126
So that's why your face
is starting to look more grown-up.

456
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,297
[melancholy music playing]

457
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,409
Yuzuru killed someone.

458
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:41,886
But in a way, so did I.

459
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:48,693
I used words to kill someone's spirit.

460
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:58,036
I can't just forget that
and move on with my life.

461
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,207
Please tell me the truth.

462
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,575
There is no truth!

463
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,247
There is.

464
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,549
You're just hiding it.

465
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,332
[melancholy music continues]

466
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,568
[distant train horn blares]

467
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,414
[indistinct chatter]

468
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,649
Wow.

469
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,486
[Katagiri] "Textbooks of the World"?

470
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,362
[sighs sharply]

471
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,602
Hm. Well, this should be fine.

472
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,071
[Mizohata] Principal, let's move on.

473
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,809
- I'll go watch them.
- Go for it.

474
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:19,684
Well?

475
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,055
- They're gone!
- [students laugh, murmur]

476
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,158
Now, let's activate Plan Okami.

477
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,026
Let's go!

478
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,995
- Yes!
- [excited chatter]

479
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,163
[Isshiki] Plan Okami?

480
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:36,801
Yes, the students
are working really hard on it.

481
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,070
[slurps]

482
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:40,872
He is really loved, isn't he?

483
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,507
I agree.

484
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,144
Hm. He is loved.

485
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,580
Frustrating as it is to admit. [chuckles]

486
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,986
[uneasy music playing]

487
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,267
[uneasy music continues playing]

488
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,641
THE DAY OF RINTOKU FESTIVAL

489
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,142
Ah, it's Mizohata.

490
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,477
Everything's fine.

491
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,979
[indistinct chatter]

492
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:33,291
What? Oh, crap!

493
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,566
[tense music playing]

494
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,240
Mr. Mizohata,
I didn't realize you were here.

495
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,976
- Mr. Mikami...
- Yes?

496
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,980
Deputy Minister Takizawa
is very busy today

497
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,816
so I'd like for you not to meet with him.

498
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,184
Understood.

499
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,758
[Katagiri] Today, we welcome
Deputy Minister of Education

500
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,028
Yuichiro Takizawa, for a site visit!

501
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,129
[applause]

502
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,970
First of all, congratulations
on today's Rintoku Festival.

503
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,139
This cultural festival,
despite being a high school event

504
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,511
has demonstrated remarkable creativity
and is well-loved by the local community.

505
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,315
[Tsugimoto] Wow,
Plan Okami is a huge success.

506
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,717
Of course!

507
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,920
We knew Mizohata would definitely
do a check in the morning too.

508
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,125
Hi!

509
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,828
Dad, you made it.

510
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,896
The hospital finally approved my leave.

511
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,666
Thank you.

512
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,868
- He seemed really excited about it.
- [chuckles]

513
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:58,009
I'd like you and Mr. Mikami
to be the first to see it.

514
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,144
[Takizawa] Everything here was handmade?

515
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,346
- Yes, that's right.
- That's amazing!

516
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,216
Everyone lined up
from early in the morning.

517
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,484
[Takizawa chuckles]

518
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,886
A school so deeply connected
with the local community

519
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,155
- has always been my ideal.
- [chuckles]

520
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:15,126
Oh, right!
Mikami is here at Rintoku, isn't he?

521
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,663
Seniors here usually don't participate

522
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,198
but his class insisted on joining.

523
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,000
What's their exhibit about?

524
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,103
[Makino]
"Textbooks of the World," apparently.

525
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,973
[Takizawa] Oh, well, that I have to see!

526
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,309
That was amazing! [laughs]

527
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,744
Wow, look at this crowd!

528
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,515
[Shinonome] Wakui is a well-known
influencer in the quiz community

529
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,317
so he spread the word.

530
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,686
Now the school can't stop us.

531
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,454
Mr. Mikami!

532
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,722
Yes?

533
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,123
Deputy Minister Takizawa is coming here.

534
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:50,695
I was truly surprised. I never imagined
there was a way to screen textbooks.

535
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,165
Wait, textbook screening?

536
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,100
Textbook screening
is explained very well here.

537
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,269
- Let me introduce you to everyone.
- [both chuckle]

538
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,973
Mr. Mikami, we need to temporarily
suspend this exhibit.

539
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,342
I don't think that's possible.

540
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,947
We sincerely apologize.

541
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:12,950
There's been a technical issue,
so we need to pause this exhibit for now.

542
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,086
The issue has been fixed!

543
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,187
You!

544
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,757
Mikami!

545
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,293
Deputy Minister Takizawa,
it's been a while.

546
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,994
I heard you were at Rintoku

547
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,163
so I was looking forward
to seeing you here.

548
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,367
Yes, I've been fully immersed
in the atmosphere here.

549
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,001
- I'm very grateful, sir.
- [Takizawa chuckles]

550
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,503
[Takizawa] Is that so?

551
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,305
Well then, keep up the good work.

552
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,439
Thank you, sir.

553
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,041
Deputy Minister,
it's time for your next appointment.

554
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,776
If you'd like, please take a look
before you leave.

555
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,044
Makino, how is he on time?

556
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,315
A minute or two should be fine.

557
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,916
Then, right this way.

558
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,285
Excuse me. [chuckles]

559
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,658
Hello.

560
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,440
Wow. [chuckles]

561
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,151
[Shinonome on recording]
Textbook screening...

562
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,320
Do you know this term?

563
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,025
- What is this about?
- [presentation chimes]

564
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,596
- Would you like to leave, sir?
- No.

565
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,802
[presentation chimes]

566
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,537
[Shinonome on recording] Textbook
screening refers to the process where...

567
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,273
before privately published
textbooks can be issued...

568
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,441
What is this?

569
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,142
...in order to determine
if their content is appropriate...

570
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,243
Well, um...

571
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,479
...they are reviewed to see
if they align with curriculum guidelines

572
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,948
by the Ministry of Education.

573
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,487
Is textbook screening necessary?

574
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,355
- [presentation chimes]
- [sighs]

575
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,294
- [presentation chimes]
- Of course it is. Right, Deputy Minister?

576
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,597
[Takizawa] Mm.

577
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,336
COUNTRIES AND REGIONS
WHERE TEXTBOOK SCREENING EXISTS

578
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,104
[presentation chimes]

579
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,676
Ah. Sir!

580
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,478
Excuse me.

581
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,712
[camera shutter clicking]

582
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,881
I'm Kanzaki from the school paper.

583
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,817
What are your thoughts on this exhibit?

584
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,320
- Kanzaki...
- No... I don't mind.

585
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,724
- I'd like to hear your thoughts.
- Hold on, Kanzaki!

586
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,392
[Kanzaki] I'm asking the Deputy Minister.

587
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:46,270
[tense music playing]

588
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,573
Would you mind answering?

589
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,745
Not just the content,
but also the use of digital technology

590
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,548
and the event-like presentation method

591
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,583
left a strong impression on me.

592
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,186
And the students...

593
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,687
What are you thinking?

594
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,324
[Takizawa]
...their creativity and passion...

595
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,627
What is going on, Mr. Mikami?

596
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,097
I apologize.
I wasn't fully aware of the content.

597
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,431
This is an educational institution.

598
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,700
Please refrain from using
bureaucratic rhetoric!

599
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,570
- What is this?
- Wait, this came before, right?

600
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,573
Excuse me, look at this.

601
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,680
"I am the one who will wield
the Kusanagi sword

602
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,216
against those who enter
through Hirakawa Gate.

603
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,954
Your corruption will soon
be exposed to the public.

604
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,123
Signed, Takeru Yamamoto."

605
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,894
[shredder beeps, whirs]

606
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,203
Okami, everyone's waiting.

607
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,538
Okay.

608
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,640
May I be excused?

609
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:58,876
Go ahead.

610
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:02,947
Hurry up!

611
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,852
[Shinonome] Thank you so much!

612
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,524
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

613
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,826
Good job, everyone! Cheers!

614
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,195
Cheers!

615
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,935
- Mr. Mikami.
- Hmm?

616
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,739
- I think I understand now.
- Huh?

617
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,375
[in English] "Personal is political."

618
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,713
[in Japanese]
What's personal is also political.

619
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,015
That's right.

620
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,118
Maybe that's why the curriculum

621
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,588
also needs to protect family peace.

622
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,061
[phone buzzing]

623
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,232
[Makino] Good job on the festival.

624
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,834
Good job on the inspection.

625
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,436
[Makino] There's something
I wanted to tell you.

626
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,107
Since you've thrown yourself
into the heart of educational reform

627
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,375
do whatever you like.

628
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,579
However, diving into textbook screening
was bit reckless, don't you think?

629
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,382
What's the problem?

630
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,917
[Makino] Isn't it obvious? The fact
that the Deputy Minister was there!

631
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:16,587
Since the establishment
of the Cabinet Personnel Bureau

632
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,589
Nagatacho has had control
over bureaucratic appointments.

633
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:19,957
You should know that, Mikami.

634
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:21,959
Is that a threat?

635
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,794
Oh, come on. Of course not.

636
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,797
Do whatever you want.

637
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,234
But if you involve my students,
I won't forgive you.

638
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,305
[upbeat rock music playing]

639
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,178
You heard that.

640
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,581
What's going on with Mikami?

641
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,185
You should be careful,
or you might get taken down.

642
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,355
Still, this is bad, Makino.

643
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,324
I didn't say you could bring up
personnel matters.

644
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:58,729
But we got played. We were used.

645
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,799
No, it's also partially your fault
for not being able to stop it.

646
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,404
Yes, and that's why
I won't let this slide.

647
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,874
I won't let Mikami do whatever he wants.
Is that okay, sir?

648
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,180
Do as you please.

649
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,485
[upbeat rock music playing]

650
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:36,867
[man 1] If I don't do it,
I won't be myself anymore.

651
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,174
[Mikami] Being betrayed by the one person
you believed in, your mother.

652
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,943
Then constantly
being berated by your father.

653
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,344
There's no way it wasn't painful.

654
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,913
It's ultimately just prioritizing
our own gain.

655
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,648
It's something
we should dedicate our lives to.

656
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,985
[man 2] Team Mikami might say something
to challenge the government.

657
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,755
Rintoku's reputation will skyrocket.

658
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,356
It was Mikami's idea, right?

659
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,925
This seems like
it might come in handy in a pinch.

660
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,828
[man 3] You, me, we're both guilty!
