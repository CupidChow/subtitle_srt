1
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:08,675
[indistinct chatter]

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,976
I have to go home.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,316
We're terribly sorry that one
of our students caused trouble.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,485
Please. Let me go home.

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,221
She's been like this the whole time.
Not even an apology.

6
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,790
Is it around the time
your helper has to leave?

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,130
- Can you go over there?
- Yes.

8
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,469
- Ms. Koreeda will go for you, so...
- [Shiiba whimpers]

9
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,739
[sobbing]

10
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,445
Can you leave us alone here
for five minutes?

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,314
Please.

12
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,387
[Shiiba sobs]

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,258
[Mikami sighs]

14
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,396
[Shiiba sniffles]

15
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,535
Take a seat.

16
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,704
[Shiiba cries, sniffles]

17
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,742
[Shiiba sniffles]

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,778
[Shiiba sighs]

19
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,755
[Shiiba sniffles]

20
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,491
I knew you had left early

21
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,228
but I was too overwhelmed
with my own stuff.

22
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,832
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,707
I understand what it's like
to carry everything alone.

24
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,014
I was the same.

25
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,555
I don't know much about periods,
so I need to be taught.

26
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,696
[Shiiba sniffles]

27
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,333
[sniffles]

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,307
From the start...

29
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,348
it was never light for me.

30
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,918
Then...

31
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,995
when my grandfather's dementia worsened...

32
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,134
my PMS got much worse.

33
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,604
PMS...

34
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,007
Oh, you mean premenstrual syndrome?

35
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,009
In my case

36
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,711
I get irritable...

37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,349
cry for no reason.

38
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,052
I can't control it.

39
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,056
The thought of my period coming...

40
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,858
[sniffles]

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,427
...makes me anxious too.

42
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,836
We won't be reporting this to the police.

43
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,972
Thank you very much.

44
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,876
Um...

45
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,180
I'm really sorry.

46
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,418
Please just pay for the items.

47
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,586
Of course.

48
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,789
Uh... Wait a moment.

49
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,457
Huh?

50
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,261
What?

51
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,603
- [Mikami] All of these, please.
- [owner] Uh...

52
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,205
[owner] Sure, but... What?

53
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,774
Would this be enough until you graduate?

54
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,980
[optimistic music playing]

55
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,682
[beeps]

56
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,417
Do you need a plastic bag? It's extra.

57
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,552
Yes, please.

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,490
This is my first time buying these.

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,960
[optimistic music playing]

60
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,629
[scanner beeps]

61
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:33,773
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

62
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,277
[Mikami] You're working several
part-time jobs, aren't you?

63
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,482
[Shiiba] We still have
a bit of money saved

64
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,786
but it's only decreasing
and that makes me anxious.

65
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,959
[Mikami] Working part-time does help
to take your mind off things too.

66
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,461
Was it like that for you too?

67
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,298
I crammed my schedule
with studying and part-time jobs.

68
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,803
In my case,
I'm living with my grandparents.

69
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,842
So I had prepared myself
for caregiving to some degree.

70
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,480
But when it's your mom...

71
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,685
it's a different kind of weight, isn't it?

72
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,861
Oh, um... What about your mom's?

73
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,430
Huh?

74
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,832
Well, you said you had never bought these.

75
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,634
Oh.

76
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,341
I always had someone else
buy that stuff for her.

77
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,679
That's pretty pathetic, huh?

78
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,383
Well...

79
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,587
Well, you did a total 180.

80
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,958
I actually talked to everyone
about it today.

81
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,427
[Shiiba] Huh?

82
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,097
About what was written about my brother
in the magazine article.

83
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,634
[Shiiba] I want to hear about that too.

84
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,805
[Mikami] Yeah, I guess you would.

85
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,544
Oh.

86
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,713
Um...

87
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,248
[Shiiba] I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,320
You really were doing your best
weren't you, Shiiba-san?

89
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,656
Um...

90
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,998
Am I... going to be expelled?

91
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,403
[Mikami] I'll do everything I can.

92
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,841
[Mizohata] Regardless of the circumstances

93
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,512
a student from Rintoku
committing shoplifting is unacceptable.

94
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,947
This is the first time
something like this has happened

95
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,349
since the school opened.

96
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,084
We cannot just let it go
without any consequences.

97
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,520
- [Yamazoe] Huh?
- [Yoshikawa] What?

98
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,090
- Whoa, not again!
- What's going on now?

99
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,925
[Yamazoe] Well... um...

100
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,261
Have you solved the mystery?
We are ready to talk.

101
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,362
YAMATO TAKERU NO MIKOTO

102
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,398
[Kodai] Well, you sure look like
you had a nice time.

103
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,666
Not at all.

104
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,969
A mere high school teacher
meeting a government official

105
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,571
at a fancy restaurant?

106
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,110
Didn't you think
it was above your station?

107
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,747
I thought it'd be better
to talk to them in person.

108
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,386
You like being in the spotlight,
don't you, Mizobata-san?

109
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,555
It's Mizohata.

110
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:40,793
That's right. What a troublesome
person you are, Mizohata-san.

111
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,896
[tense music playing]

112
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,400
So, what's going to happen
with that shoplifting incident?

113
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,236
[Mizohata] Uh, well...

114
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,039
She's stained Rintoku's reputation.

115
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,975
That should at least warrant expulsion.

116
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,977
Expulsion? For shoplifting?

117
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:03,249
I think what she did warrants as much.

118
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,751
[tense music playing]

119
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:14,260
[Kanzaki] You two heard about Yuzuru's
incident directly from Ms. Saejima, right?

120
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,697
Right after it happened

121
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,900
she said the media
would find out soon enough

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,436
and that the students might get shaken up

123
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,372
so she asked us to help
with emotional support.

124
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,044
What's with her anyway?

125
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,517
Doesn't she put herself last
a little too much?

126
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,722
She was really worried
about you too, Kanzaki.

127
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:48,728
I don't deserve that kind of concern.

128
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,898
[Koreeda] That's just how she is.

129
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,134
[melancholy music playing]

130
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,374
Could it be...

131
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,480
she's protecting someone, like me?

132
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,116
Huh? What do you mean?

133
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,220
I asked her many times,
but she kept saying it was just an affair.

134
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,888
[Kurayoshi] Shiiba's absent?

135
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,090
Yeah, it looks like it.

136
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,727
What's wrong?
You look like you're about to cry.

137
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,697
[chuckles] I'm just a little worried.

138
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,034
[female student] Huh? No way!

139
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,636
[male student]
My relative works at a drugstore.

140
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,737
[Tsugimoto] The yearbook?

141
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,907
Yeah. I want you to look
into something for me.

142
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,109
Oh, nice!

143
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,549
Do you even understand
what "inconveniencing others" means?

144
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,452
Hey, that's rude! Of course I do.

145
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,387
Really?

146
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,758
Still, having you rely on me
kind of makes my heart skip a beat.

147
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,728
Ask what I want you to look into first.

148
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,830
You're trying to find someone. Am I wrong?

149
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,533
You're not wrong.

150
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,502
Heart-skipping moment!

151
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,340
- [thumps]
- Ow, that hurts! What was that for?

152
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,544
If Ms. Saejima's protecting someone,
it has to be a student.

153
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,646
There's no other explanation.

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,282
- [game music playing]
- [game character grunts]

155
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,484
What do you want?

156
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,886
I need a favor.

157
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,656
My, how you've grown!

158
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,692
[game characters grunt, groan]

159
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,565
That's something a teacher
says to a student.

160
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,002
Come on, a favor from Okami?

161
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,571
- Is that bad?
- [Tominaga] Not at all. I'm honored.

162
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:43,576
Is this favor about Shiiba?

163
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,345
[Tsukada] This is a problem.

164
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,483
I'm not sure who did this,
but this isn't newsworthy.

165
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,118
No one would even bat an eye.

166
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,255
Even so, it seems to have had
a major effect on Mr. Kodai.

167
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,092
Exactly. He's gotten all cautious again.

168
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,264
Oh, right. Chief Cabinet Secretary
Azuma got in touch.

169
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,501
That doesn't sound like good news.

170
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,270
"My granddaughter refuses to go
to any school but Rintoku."

171
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,407
"Make a backdoor entry happen."
That's the message.

172
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,709
[sighs] I knew it.

173
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,178
[Nakaoka] There's also a message
for you, Mr. Tsukada.

174
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,183
"If you're aiming to become Vice Minister,
this is your last chance, given your age."

175
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,152
What will you do?

176
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,687
What will I do?

177
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,856
Well, I guess I have no choice
but to get Mr. Kodai to accept it.

178
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,393
Could you give him
one more push, Mr. Tsukada?

179
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,732
Huh? Isn't that your job, Mr. Nakaoka?

180
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,636
[exhales]

181
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,641
[grunts]

182
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,884
- [thumps]
- I'm sorry.

183
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,424
[panting]

184
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,596
[tense music playing]

185
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,432
[thumps]

186
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,601
Tsubuki?

187
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,471
Tsubuki!

188
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,745
- [door opening]
- [footsteps approaching]

189
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,915
- Mai!
- Mr. Makino, sorry.

190
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,884
They said it was probably
dizziness from overwork.

191
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,754
But just to be sure,
they're doing an MRI tomorrow.

192
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,323
Can I see him?

193
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,459
[approaching footsteps]

194
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,964
[Tsubuki] Why did you come?

195
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,002
Of course I came.

196
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,640
What would I have done
if you couldn't see our baby?

197
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,309
[chuckles] That's being
a bit overdramatic.

198
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,513
- [Mai] Thank goodness...
- [Tsubuki] I'm sorry.

199
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,614
[Mai sobbing]

200
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,383
Mr. Takami, can you hear me?

201
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,285
[nurse] Are you all right?

202
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,858
[ominous music playing]

203
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,136
I should get going.

204
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,872
Thank you very much.

205
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:35,114
Tsubuki, even if you're discharged
after tomorrow's tests

206
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,383
do not come to work.

207
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,952
- But...
- This is an official order.

208
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,357
Recently, Haruno Shiiba from Class 3-2

209
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,893
was caught shoplifting at a drugstore.

210
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,530
It was due to financial hardship at home

211
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,401
but it also came to light that she
was working multiple part-time jobs

212
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,169
which are prohibited by school rules.

213
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,039
Therefore, after much consideration...

214
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,742
we've decided on expulsion.

215
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,178
She was informed earlier today.

216
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,348
Why was this decision made
without consulting the homeroom teacher?

217
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,085
You are not an official
staff member of this school.

218
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,887
This is outrageous.

219
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,591
At a time when she needed help the most,
you chose to expel her?

220
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,427
[Mizohata] Among the part-time jobs
Haruno Shiiba was working

221
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,762
one was as a fake profile
on a dating site.

222
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,931
What?

223
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,067
If things went badly,
she could have been charged with fraud.

224
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:33,305
Knowing that, we had no choice
but to make this decision.

225
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,618
There's a rumor going around
that Shiiba was expelled.

226
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,987
- Is it true?
- Yes.

227
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,788
What's going on?

228
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,024
The school says
they wouldn't disclose the reason

229
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,459
since it's a personal matter.

230
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,461
What? So you're just
going to leave it like this?

231
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,529
What do you think?

232
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,132
It's unacceptable.

233
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,175
Do you know what this is?

234
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,711
[Wakui] If we know
what the denominator is.

235
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,115
G7. The top seven
advanced countries in the world...

236
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,117
Then this is probably GDP,
gross domestic product

237
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,387
ranking third among the G7.

238
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:28,827
Okay, what about this?

239
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,830
GDP per capita.
Actually, it's the lowest among the G7.

240
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,167
Well, that's not wrong per se.

241
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,435
[Kanzaki] Oh.

242
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,871
Relative poverty rate...

243
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,708
[male student] Huh?
What is "relative poverty rate"?

244
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,326
[chalk scratching]

245
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,429
ABSOLUTE POVERTY

246
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,131
There are countries in the world

247
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,967
where people don't even have food
or water for tomorrow.

248
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,603
That's when the entire country is poor

249
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,305
and we call that "absolute poverty."

250
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,811
[chalk scratching]

251
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,285
RELATIVE POVERTY

252
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,354
There's something called
the "poverty line."

253
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,857
Poverty line refers to the amount of
take-home income below the amount required

254
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,392
by a household
to afford basic necessities.

255
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,297
This means Japan has the highest
percentage of households

256
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,632
under the poverty line among the G7.

257
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,371
[Mikami] Japan was long referred to
as a "middle-class society."

258
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,507
But before we realized it,
more and more people

259
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,010
have been slipping out
of that middle class. In other words...

260
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,453
STRATIFIED SOCIETY

261
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,789
This is what Japan has become.

262
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,591
And a pretty extreme one at that.

263
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,367
[string music playing]

264
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,702
[Chigira] Shiiba!

265
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,919
[Mikami] I looked into it.

266
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,321
In Rintoku's case,
naturally, at the time of enrollment

267
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,292
there are virtually zero households
that are financially struggling.

268
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,695
This school is filled
with people who can afford

269
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,065
an extremely high tuition,
even among private schools.

270
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,600
They're all from the top tier
of this stratified society.

271
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,137
However, over the course of three years

272
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,506
naturally some students'
financial situations decline.

273
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,707
In the past...

274
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,845
there were students
who had no choice but to withdraw.

275
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,116
Shiiba-san.

276
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,419
[Shiiba] Yes.

277
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,321
[Mikami] Is there something
you'd like to say?

278
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,661
There is.

279
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:17,996
[Mikami] Go ahead.

280
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,658
I know this is an important time
for everyone.

281
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,333
So I'm sorry for taking up
your time with this.

282
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,202
But...

283
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,075
Please let me talk for a bit.

284
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:14,052
When I was in kindergarten...

285
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,896
my parents died in a car accident.

286
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,771
But my grandparents raised me

287
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,775
and made sure I had everything I needed.

288
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,049
Then, earlier this year...

289
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:52,191
my grandfather developed dementia.

290
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,095
We had to close our shop

291
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,501
and I became overwhelmed every day.

292
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,043
And I ended up causing trouble...

293
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,814
for the school and all of you.

294
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,753
[Chigira] Causing us trouble?
You don't have to be so considerate.

295
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,504
This is our country
we're talking about, right?

296
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:48,680
And you're trying to show us that
by laying yourself bare.

297
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,586
Your saying that you're bothering us
honestly makes me sad.

298
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,524
Right now, there's nothing more important
than listening to you.

299
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,327
At least, that's how I feel.

300
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,907
"Personal is political."
That's what my late brother taught me.

301
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,112
Personal struggles
are political struggles.

302
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,484
The difficulties Shiiba-san faces
are connected to society.

303
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,986
They're connected to politics.

304
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,157
They're connected to whether or not
we'll have a better future.

305
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,327
This is not just Shiiba-san's problem.

306
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:48,874
What triggered my punishment
was shoplifting.

307
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,846
But what sealed the decision...

308
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,285
was my part-time job.

309
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,290
Working a fake profile on a dating app.

310
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:14,866
[Shiiba] It's a job
that could be considered fraud.

311
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,936
But...

312
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:24,343
I could do it from home,
and the hourly wage was good.

313
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,680
I couldn't turn back.

314
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,091
Why menstrual products?

315
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,364
What Shiiba took from the drugstore
was menstrual products.

316
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,632
- Stop it!
- [Mikami] Why?

317
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,235
That's not a question to ask a woman.
I won't allow it.

318
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,503
Shiiba should be the one to decide.

319
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:53,972
Huh?

320
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,142
Whether to be angry at the question,
or to answer it...

321
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,146
I think Shiiba should decide that.

322
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,116
After all, it's about her.

323
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:20,098
I came here today to talk about that.

324
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:30,575
Because Mr. Mikami asked me to.

325
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,879
[Mikami] Can you tell everyone?

326
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,313
Do you want to?

327
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,949
Tell them what?

328
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,186
Why you had to steal these.

329
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,602
My grandfather runs
a Japanese sweets shop.

330
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,372
He sells red bean rice.

331
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,044
In our neighborhood,
everyone celebrates a girl's first period

332
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,579
with red bean rice.

333
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,148
Because of that

334
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,887
I grew up believing
that having your period was a good thing

335
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:20,725
and that it was something
important for a girl.

336
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:31,503
What was once precious to me
became something just painful.

337
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,775
It started after things at home
went downhill.

338
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:42,614
I had to figure everything out myself

339
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,451
or else nothing could move forward.

340
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,323
Financial problems scare me the most.

341
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,261
I know I'll have to sell the shop.

342
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:05,971
And I know I'll have to put
my grandparents in a care facility.

343
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,677
But whenever I'd try to think about it

344
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,381
my head would get overwhelmed

345
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,854
and my body would get heavier and heavier.

346
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,724
[Shiiba sniffles]

347
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,560
[sobbing] I'm sorry, Shiiba.

348
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,163
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

349
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,200
[crying] I'm so, so sorry.

350
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,669
[Shiiba] Don't apologize, Chigira.

351
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,505
[sniffles, sobs]

352
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,343
[Shiiba] I knew you were
really worried about me.

353
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:52,050
But when you're truly, truly struggling...

354
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,022
you have to dull something
inside yourself.

355
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:06,031
Or it becomes impossible just to live.

356
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,438
You even stop realizing
that there are people you could talk to.

357
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,342
And yet, my period would come...

358
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,748
forcing me to realize
that I'm still alive.

359
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,719
I'm...

360
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,858
bleeding here...

361
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,263
and yet nobody notices.

362
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,533
It hurt.

363
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,103
I realized...

364
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,642
that what I really wanted...

365
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,351
was for someone to notice that I'm here.

366
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,752
[sobs, sniffles]

367
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,591
Thank you for listening.

368
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,060
[Shiiba sniffles]

369
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,237
Thank you for sharing
something so important.

370
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,676
[sniffling]

371
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,246
So...

372
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,881
[Mikami] What?

373
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,555
In this situation, where exactly
should we direct our protest?

374
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,362
Hm.

375
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,767
[clears throat]

376
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,704
Let's think about it.
Let's figure out how.

377
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,541
All right.

378
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,144
Let's do this!

379
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,780
What?

380
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:08,053
If we miss the boat now,
us guys will be behind forever.

381
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,555
So I figured I'd better get serious.

382
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,124
There's not a single person in this world

383
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,493
who isn't connected
to menstruation in some way.

384
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:19,431
First, we'll start with research.

385
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,634
Let's meet in the PC room after school.

386
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,805
Hold on, maybe we should
assign roles first?

387
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,908
If it's class notes, leave it to me.

388
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,142
I'll help too.

389
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:35,346
[indistinct chatter]

390
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,762
[hopeful piano music playing]

391
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,848
[camera clicks]

392
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,724
[Tominaga] Sorry,
I forgot to erase the board.

393
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,092
[chuckles] It's fine.

394
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,595
Everyone's got stuff to do.
I can handle this.

395
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:25,964
[groans]

396
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,634
Hmm? What is it?
Sorry, was I not supposed to erase this?

397
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:32,704
Should I say it, or not?

398
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,006
What are you trying to say? [chuckles]

399
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,044
Ms. Koreeda, you're feeling down, right?

400
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,514
No, not really.

401
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,049
You're regretting stepping in
back there, aren't you?

402
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,252
Blaming yourself for ruining the moment.

403
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,456
Actually, Okami had asked me about it.

404
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:52,624
[Koreeda] Huh?

405
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,560
He told me, "I know Ms. Koreeda
will try to stop me

406
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,428
so would you mind stepping in?"

407
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,466
I asked him if it wouldn't be easier
to talk to you

408
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,301
about it first, but he said...

409
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,537
Even if we're on the same page

410
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,007
having someone who will protect you
with all they've got...

411
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,976
makes all the difference.

412
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,152
[Tominaga] Okami truly believed
that you would protect Shiiba.

413
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:25,123
[emotional string music playing]

414
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,095
[chuckles]

415
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,664
THE REALITY CHILDREN FACE AT SCHOOL
DUE TO RELATIVE POVERTY

416
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,265
1 IN 2 SINGLE-MOTHER HOUSEHOLDS
LIVE IN RELATIVE POVERTY

417
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,139
Sorry to interrupt,
but I want you to see this.

418
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,808
If we had proper counseling systems
and support at school...

419
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,511
Excuse me, is now a good time?

420
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,847
Could we have a moment of your time?

421
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,482
This is about one of our classmates.

422
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,819
We'll collect it here.
Thank you very much.

423
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,589
This is regarding relative poverty.

424
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,524
Have you heard of the term
"period poverty"?

425
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,627
This is a very real
and pressing issue for women.

426
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,329
She's my best friend.

427
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,332
[Kodai] Amazing.
This is almost the entire student body.

428
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,134
We're requesting that the expulsion
of Haruno Shiiba be rescinded

429
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,570
and that a support system
be established for students

430
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,006
whose family situations worsen.

431
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,408
Understood.

432
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,111
We will consider it.

433
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,847
- [Wakui] Thank you.
- [Chigira] Thank you very much.

434
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,550
[Kodai] Okay.

435
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,688
[door opens]

436
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,393
- [Wakui] Excuse me.
- [Chigira] Excuse me.

437
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,499
Our students are politically aware.

438
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,668
You had to have seen this coming.

439
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:47,238
Was it not you who insisted
on expulsion, Chairman Kodai?

440
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,808
I said her actions must have consequences.

441
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,145
But, at any rate,
these are the consequences.

442
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,917
[panting]

443
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,621
[Tsugimoto] Apparently, the chairman
has a statement to make.

444
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,090
- Huh?
- Is it about Shiiba?

445
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,327
[Tsugimoto] I'm not sure, but... [panting]

446
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,129
- [Tsugimoto] Here they come.
- [door opens]

447
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,304
They've made a decision about Shiiba.

448
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,471
[students murmur]

449
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,876
In regards to that, Chairman Kodai
has a message for you all.

450
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,217
[knocking on door]

451
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,385
Yes.

452
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,254
Hi, there.

453
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,488
[Tsubuki] Mr. Makino.

454
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,129
I heard your test results came back.

455
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,731
Yes.

456
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,335
Apparently, one of the arteries
in my brain was nearly blocked.

457
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,104
It's worse than they expected.

458
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,907
They put me on strict bed rest
until surgery.

459
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,945
It's gotta be from
all that yakiniku, right?

460
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,117
So I spent my own money
only to nearly kill a subordinate?

461
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,020
[sighs]

462
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,489
Well, that stinks.

463
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,394
What's worse is, the surgery date
is the exact same...

464
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,898
as my wife's due date.

465
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,604
Why are we even doing this job?

466
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,208
Seriously.

467
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,913
[melancholy choral music playing]

468
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,392
[choral music continues]

469
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,595
[sighs]

470
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,936
SHIINOHA

471
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,075
[Kodai] At this time, the board
of directors, the board of trustees

472
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,778
as well as the entire faculty...

473
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:12,150
have looked at your petition
with both great surprise and joy.

474
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,655
Seeing your signatures made us realize

475
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,625
just how narrow-minded we were.

476
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:27,198
I've always hoped to educate
our students to be virtuous

477
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,638
to want to help those around them.

478
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:39,410
This time, I feel that you all reminded me

479
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,182
of our founding ideals.

480
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,453
Therefore, Haruno Shiiba's
expulsion will be revoked.

481
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,654
Call it off?

482
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,458
Furthermore, we promise to establish
a system to support students

483
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:57,895
whose economic circumstances
change after enrollment.

484
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,398
- Yes!
- We did it!

485
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,667
[students cheering]

486
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,469
Yeah!

487
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,904
Congrats! [laughing]

488
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,541
We did it! Yes! Yes!
[laughing]

489
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,778
[Chigira] Thank goodness!

490
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,814
I hope she comes back soon. [laughing]

491
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,887
[Koreeda] I heard from Tominaga
that you secretly asked her for help.

492
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,024
Why not just tell me directly?

493
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,461
Wow, Tominaga spilled the beans?

494
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,497
If I had known about it...

495
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,434
I knew that without your help,
this couldn't be resolved, Ms. Koreeda.

496
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,836
- But...
- But what?

497
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,772
You're not the kind of person
who can lie to get things done, are you?

498
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:49,714
That's exactly why you can stand alongside
the students, shoulder-to-shoulder.

499
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,416
That's not true.

500
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,786
Is there another assistant
homeroom teacher here

501
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,289
who attends every single homeroom period?

502
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:02,026
- That was your idea.
- Yes, I proposed it.

503
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,696
But you were the one who chose
to be there for the students

504
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,265
instead of clinging to pride or position.

505
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,476
I used to think being
"as competent as a man"

506
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,778
was a compliment.

507
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,016
I pushed myself to live up to that.

508
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:27,885
[sighs deeply]

509
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,388
But I realize now that's not the case.

510
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,193
A society built on that mindset
is what has led us here.

511
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,195
That's true.

512
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,066
I'll just do my job.

513
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,802
That's all I can do, right?

514
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,007
And that's the hardest thing, isn't it?

515
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,377
Yes.

516
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,182
- Can I ask you something?
- What is it?

517
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:02,220
You know I came here
thanks to my family's influence, right?

518
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,421
Yes.

519
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,726
My mother is a strict woman.

520
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,697
She was against me
becoming a teacher in the first place.

521
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,738
But I wanted to be a teacher
who not only teaches academically

522
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,176
but also faces students' problems head-on.

523
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:31,916
So, I deliberately chose
a high school in a rough area.

524
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,418
That made her really angry.

525
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,387
[chuckling] Is that right?

526
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,324
She turned down that school
behind my back and instead...

527
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,293
she chose this one.

528
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,899
Even now, I regret going along with it.

529
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,837
Did you maybe want to become
one of those passionate "super teachers"?

530
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,038
[laughs]

531
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,941
- I figured you'd say that.
- [chuckling] Sorry.

532
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,180
And so I ended up at Rintoku,
not by choice

533
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,284
but I've come to think
it's a really good school.

534
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,520
Its values are something to be proud of

535
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,591
and Chairman Kodai
seemed like someone worthy of respect.

536
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:21,065
But after that whole fax thing
and today's announcement...

537
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,468
I realized it's not about the students.

538
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,672
It's always about him
being the main character.

539
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,410
It's like he's just drunk
on his own words.

540
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,950
So I think I'll try talking
to my mother...

541
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,187
telling her that Chairman Kodai

542
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,890
might be straying from the right path.

543
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,194
And if that's the case...

544
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,764
then I have to protect my students.

545
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,206
CONTINUATION AND EFFECTIVE UTILIZATION
OF SHIINOHA

546
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,574
[Shiiba] What's this?

547
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,278
Thanks to you mustering up
your courage, we learned a lot.

548
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,715
Of course it's important for the girls

549
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,119
but it's just as important
for the boys too.

550
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,021
That's how everyone feels.

551
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,623
So, we thought
this was the least we could do.

552
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,229
Wouldn't it be great
if the sweets shop Shiinoha

553
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,132
could stay open with the same name?

554
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,335
[Shiiba] No way. That's impossible.

555
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,970
Why?

556
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,906
Wagashi shops aren't doing well anymore.

557
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,708
There aren't many successors either.

558
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,378
But Shiinoha didn't see
any drop in sales, right?

559
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,415
Well, yeah, because we've had
loyal customers since the old days.

560
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,318
But now, even those
connections have faded.

561
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,719
We want you to see this.

562
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,991
Shiinoha's old customer's
says that if the shop continues

563
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,926
they'd be happy to support it.

564
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,062
I can't run a sweets shop.

565
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,199
That's why we want to match you
with an artisan looking for a store

566
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,502
and set up a crowdfunding campaign.

567
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,175
Thank you.

568
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,111
But...

569
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,115
I've already made my decision.

570
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,217
What do you mean?

571
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,687
[Shiiba] My uncle
on my mother's side is a realtor.

572
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,791
I finally reached out to him.

573
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,195
Wait, does that mean
you're selling Shiinoha?

574
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,998
Yeah.

575
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,300
Are you okay with that?

576
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,869
All this time...

577
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:44,642
I was too proud to say "help me."

578
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,745
But I finally said it.

579
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,584
Because all of you taught me
the courage to ask for help.

580
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,655
What did your uncle say?

581
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,193
He said, "I've always been ready
to do whatever it takes

582
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,094
if you needed help, Haruno."

583
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,498
Then if he would just take a look
at these documents, I'm sure...

584
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,601
My dad said this could really work.

585
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,735
[Shiiba sighs]

586
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,606
Wow, you guys are amazing.

587
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,277
I would've never come up
with something like this.

588
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,746
That's why...

589
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,450
Why not give it a try, Shiiba?

590
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,986
[Shiiba] Uh...

591
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,423
But...

592
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,127
[choral music playing]

593
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,462
Hmm...

594
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,730
I don't know.

595
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,803
If it's not my grandpa's flavor...

596
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,241
then I don't think it's really "Shiinoha."

597
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:54,612
[choral music continues]

598
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,484
But... I'm really happy
you did this for me.

599
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,221
The fact that I can actually feel
happy right now...

600
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,492
that alone makes me really happy.

601
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,998
If I ever lose my way again...

602
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,170
can I come ask you all for help?

603
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,773
Of course! Right?

604
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,475
Yes.

605
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,945
[laughs]

606
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,747
You promise, okay?

607
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,682
[Shiiba] Yeah, thank you.

608
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,853
Team BizCon
will absolutely support you too.

609
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,321
[all laughing]

610
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,422
[Shiiba] Thank you.

611
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:44,728
[Tsukada] I heard that the grades
in Mikami's class have dropped.

612
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,732
So, I have a proposal.

613
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:54,038
What? You're suggesting we send Mr. Mikami
back to the Ministry of Education?

614
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:58,576
Well, we're concerned
that he might cause further trouble

615
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,877
if this continues.

616
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:04,982
Actually, I sense a lot
of potential in Mr. Mikami.

617
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,119
I believe he could take Rintoku
to the next level.

618
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:13,023
That is true.
He's definitely a man with potential.

619
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,661
I'm glad to hear you say that.

620
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:24,668
If you really feel that way,
then what do you say?

621
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:31,308
Why not draw him in
while we still can? Keep him close.

622
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:42,453
Mikami probably doesn't want
to leave Rintoku right now.

623
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:45,656
So, let's have him improve
his class's performance first.

624
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:49,593
And after that, we either
bring him over to our side...

625
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,763
or we cut him off.

626
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,532
[foreboding music playing]

627
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,670
Mikami.

628
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,272
Makino.

629
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,009
Nakaoka.

630
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,878
Mizohata.

631
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:12,983
It's time to figure out who to keep

632
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,488
and who to turn into allies.

633
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,157
[Kodai] Understood.

634
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,394
Well then, talk to you again.

635
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,798
[rock music playing]

636
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,096
It seems like we're moving forward,
but we're actually stuck.

637
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,466
Even if there was
an illegitimate admission

638
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,936
just receiving a donation
won't get the prosecutors involved.

639
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,339
Unless we have clear evidence
that improper benefits

640
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,741
were obtained from Nagatacho
or Kasumigaseki...

641
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:15,179
[Isshiki] And whether or not
Ms. Saejima was involved...

642
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,584
once it all connects,
it'll probably come together fast.

643
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:26,790
Yes, but we can't just sit here
doing nothing.

644
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,859
Do you know anything about this case?

645
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,627
No, we don't.

646
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,130
Let's try using this.

647
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,403
[woman 1] This school
is engaged in illicit behavior.

648
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,072
[man] I'm not about to let this slide.

649
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,974
We must not allow a precedent to be set
where a homeroom teacher is replaced.

650
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,609
This is your last chance.

651
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,312
If everything came to light,
it would be a big problem, wouldn't it?

652
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,881
[woman 2] It's unforgivable
to make money off children's lives.

653
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,716
Eventually, they'll all become troublesome

654
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,718
these men who know too much.

655
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,488
This is about my student.

656
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,390
There's something I'd like your help with.
