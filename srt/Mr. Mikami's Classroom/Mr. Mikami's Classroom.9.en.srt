[video games beeping]

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,314
[Mikami] Excuse me.

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,783
Did the girl who's always playing
that game show up today?

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,319
- I haven't seen her yet today.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,456
Tominaga always comes here?

7
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,158
This is the only place I could think of.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,095
[players laugh]

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,598
- The girl was messed up.
- Was she drunk?

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,099
Sure, she was even in her school uniform.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,200
[both laugh]

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,569

[suspenseful music playing]

14
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,120
You managed to send an SOS.

15
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,456
You did great.

16
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,125
[sighs]

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,802
[Tominaga sobs]

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,272
Um, my place is nearby.
Let's go there for now.

19
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,542
Tominaga, think you can make it?

20
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,344
Okay, ready, one, two... All right.

21
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,197
[laughing] All three of us
are wearing my clothes...

22
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,598
That's pretty hilarious.

23
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:41,968
[Tominaga mumbles]

24
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,970
Huh?

25
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,974
Sorry.

26
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,710
[Mikami] If you want to talk, I'll listen.

27
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,213
And if you don't you don't have to.

28
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,049
If it's better to wait, then I'll wait.

29
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,719
You already...

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,290
know, don't you, Okami?

31
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,695
I kind of suspected it.

32
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,665
This is about your precious family.

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:24,344
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

34
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,849
I knew that your younger brother
has a disability.

35
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,787
He has a congenital condition
with his spine and can't walk.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,857
He also has a mild learning disability.

37
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,960
I also heard your parents
are completely devoted to his care.

38
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,265
What concerned me

39
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,435
was that, despite those circumstances

40
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,138
you were always killing time
at the game arcade.

41
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,574
And yet...

42
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,510
Seeing how positive you always were

43
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,347
I convinced myself that nothing was wrong.

44
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:08,054
Is Detective Okami's deduction
right, Tominaga?

45
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,396
My brother...

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,835
he gets unstable when I'm around.

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,774
He has this rule
that he goes into his room

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,043
at 8:00 p.m. every night.

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,548
So I made sure to come home
after that time.

50
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,484
That's tough.

51
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,254
I still remember...

52
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,124
Ryu-chan...

53
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,995
That's my brother's name.

54
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,833
I remember the day he stopped liking me.

55
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,474
You know those relatives
who mean well but always...

56
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,545
say the wrong things?

57
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,415
One of them told him...

58
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,353
"Your sister's going to
Tokyo University, right?"

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,556
[exhales deeply]

60
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,428
"She should've given half
her brains to you, Ryu-chan."

61
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,364
Are you serious?

62
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,368
I got so mad and yelled

63
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:30,970
"That's not funny!"

64
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,875
But ever since then...

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,078
[sniffles]

66
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,182
Ryu-chan hasn't been the same.

67
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,889
Can I ask what happened today?

68
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,328
Lately, Ryu-chan's been really agitated.

69
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,198
I got a call from my mom

70
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,302
saying she couldn't
calm him down by herself.

71
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,172
So, I rushed home.

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,641
When I go there,
he really was out of control.

73
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,147
Without thinking, I said...

74
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,017
[sniffles]

75
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,154
"That's enough! Cut it out!"

76
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,093
When I saw Ryu-chan's palm
covered in blood

77
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,096
I thought

78
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,268
"Maybe the only thing
I can do is not be here."

79
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,071
That's what crossed my mind.

80
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,541
[emotional music playing]

81
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,618
[Mikami] I see.

82
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,720
[Tominaga sniffles]

83
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,057
- Thanks for calling me.
- [sobs]

84
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,296
It meant a lot.

85
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,065
[Tominaga] Huh...

86
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,267
Sounds silly, doesn't it?

87
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,572
But having a student
rely on my like that...

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,109
makes me really happy.

89
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,248
[knocking on the door]

90
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,751
We're in the middle of something
right now!

91
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,786
[woman] Come on! Open up!

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,156
Sorry.

93
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,565
- [gasps]
- You must be starving.

94
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,201
Here, warm yourself up
with something hot.

95
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,436
Thank you.

96
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,707
It's nothing. If anything,
you're the one working late.

97
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,779
Say, Tominaga-chan,
why don't you stay over tonight?

98
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,715
- Huh?
- Tomorrow's Saturday anyway.

99
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,117
I figured I might be meddling, but...

100
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,819
I already called your mom.

101
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,021
Wow, Mom for the win!

102
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,158
She told me a little bit
about what's going on.

103
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,260
So if you're okay with it...

104
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,896
Thank you.

105
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,766
[chuckles] All right then, it's settled!
Here, have some udon!

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,336
Most things are manageable
if you eat udon.

107
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,504
[chuckles]

108
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,674
- Thank you for the food!
- Go ahead, enjoy.

109
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,775
Take your time.

110
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,710
Thank you.

111
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,196
[Tokura] I've been worried
this whole time.

112
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,299
For these past four years

113
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,401
I kept thinking something might happen.

114
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,003
[Kanzaki] Tokura...

115
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,006
told me everything.

116
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,645
He hacked into the school system
to get the test questions.

117
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,282
And he got caught.

118
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,587
[thunder rumbles]

119
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,590
It was during a time
when I was struggling mentally

120
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,660
and was completely unable
to keep up with my studies.

121
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,165
So I panicked, and that's why...

122
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,968
Please tell me.

123
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,505
What really happened?

124
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,776
I desperately negotiated
with the school

125
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,646
so Tokura wouldn't be punished.

126
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,147
That's all.

127
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,483
I should've properly
faced the consequences.

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,519
But...

129
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,191
there must've been some strings attached.

130
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,295
It's way too suspicious
that he didn't face any consequences.

131
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,833
He had always been a dedicated student.

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,168
He was pushed to the edge

133
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,405
because the school failed
to look after his mental well-being.

134
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,608
In other words,
it was my fault, wasn't it?

135
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,779
When you put it like that...

136
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,751
So a deal really was made, wasn't it?

137
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,423
And the real reason
why you left the school...

138
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,227
It wasn't an affair.

139
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,764
It was sexual assault.

140
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,937
[Tokura] I looked up to you.

141
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,773
You always put your students first...

142
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,209
and put yourself last.

143
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,179
But maybe, Ms. Saejima...

144
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,882
there are some things

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,052
you shouldn't put off, right?

146
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,923
By protecting me...

147
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,627
you threw everything off balance.

148
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,396
Because of that

149
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,399
your daughter got hurt.

150
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,769
She ended up doing something terrible.

151
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,609
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,414
I'm so sorry.

153
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,883
I'm really sorry.

154
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,433
I was...

155
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,537
helping the school cover up...

156
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,508
its wrongdoing.

157
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,144
Wrongdoing?

158
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:52,952
Rintoku had been accepting
students through illegitimate admissions.

159
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,389
Don't tell me...

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,960
Did Mr. Tsutsui find out
and start blackmailing you?

161
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,130
Yes.

162
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,134
Do you have any kind of proof?

163
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,102
No, I don't.

164
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,109
Tokura...

165
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,782
I should be the one apologizing.

166
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,686
I was going in circles all on my own.

167
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,822
I hurt people.

168
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,826
I hurt you.

169
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,663
I hurt my daughter too.

170
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,837
Um...

171
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,841
I will never forget.

172
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,747
I'll never forget that you protected me
with everything you had.

173
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,951
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

174
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,788
[uplifting music playing]

175
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,623

TO YUZURU MAYAMA

179
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,306
[Tsugimoto] If you think
about slope with tangent

180
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,541
you can solve it easily, right?

181
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,642
[Kanzaki] I see.

182
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,210
You don't have to force it
into the cosine rule.

183
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,413
[Tominaga] Wait! My synapses are firing!

184
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,416
Oh, and now the brain cells
are connecting with a bang!

185
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,387
What is this? It's like
"Good morning, new world!"

186
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,055
I might be having a good morning too.

187
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,691
- [Tominaga] Yeah!
- [all laugh]

188
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,093
[Tsugimoto] Let's move on
to the next question.

189
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,228
- Try solving this as a challenge.
- [Tominaga] Oh, sounds good!

190
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,397
Hold up. This might not be
a good morning for me.

191
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,367
This is from Mai-chan.

192
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,304
- Here.
- What's this?

193
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,009
[both laugh]

194
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,878
It's adorable. Thanks.

195
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,047
Mai-chan really wanted to come.

196
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,551
- Yeah, I know.
- You really are loved.

197
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,085
I'm not sure about that.

198
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:45,424
She's mad at me
because I'm useless when it counts.

199
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,396
Tsubuki...

200
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,866
what are you going to do
after the surgery?

201
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,769
Huh? What do you mean?

202
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,338
Are you coming back
to the Ministry of Education?

203
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,480
I can't really think about that right now.

204
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,154
Personally...

205
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,591
Of course, I want you to come back.

206
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,296
Now, with that in mind,
I want you hear me out.

207
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,702
If you're going to quit, now's the time.

208
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,042
That's ridiculous.

209
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,514
Tsubuki...

210
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,785
you're the second one, you know.

211
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,324
[Tsubuki] Yeah, I know.

212
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,164
He collapsed, which lead
to a mental breakdown.

213
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,068
And in the end, he took his own life.

214
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,941
[inhales deeply]

215
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,946
[Makino] I saw the signs.

216
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,617
But having Mikami point it out me...

217
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,688
my pride got the best of me.

218
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,925
[tense music playing]

219
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,451
You're afraid and worried, aren't you?

220
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
Yeah.

221
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,593
I'm so scared that I can't sleep.

222
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,644
If you do come back,
I'll support you with everything I've got.

223
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,748
And if you change careers,
I'll help you in any way I can.

224
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,888
Thank you.

225
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,329
But are you...

226
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,200
really in a position
to be worrying about me?

227
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,137
Makino-san, you're looking
pretty terrible right now.

228
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,841
[both chuckle]

229
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,445
I'm fine, really.

230
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,815
[chuckles]

231
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,350
See?

232
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,252
[laughs softly]

233
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,588
[Mazakazu] That looks good.

234
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,959
When you were little and asked for cake,
your mom never let you have any.

235
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,262
- Yeah, it's delicious.
- Yeah.

236
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,633
I was able to talk to Tokui-san.

237
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,604
I heard that the chairman and Tokui-san
were high school classmates.

238
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,641
But he didn't donate,
which seemed suspicious.

239
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,113
Actually, Tokui-san was involved
as an external auditor

240
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,581
when the prep school
was first established.

241
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,849
Really?

242
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,855
Yeah, and even back then, there were
rumors about under-the-table money

243
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,290
so he pulled out.

244
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,564
Tokui-san said maybe Kodai-san
is the kind of person who

245
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,801
ends up deceiving even himself
while spouting his ideals.

246
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,905
Chairman Kodai had this way
of making everyone he meets

247
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,707
believe he is a wonderful educator.

248
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,877
Even I was one of them.

249
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,758
Mom used to worry...

250
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,796
because you were frail and a picky eater.

251
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,468
She would say, "If I let her eat cake,
she won't eat dinner."

252
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,642
Mom was also the one
who connected you to Tokui-san.

253
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,811
Really?

254
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,749
I'm sure your feelings got through to her.

255
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,967
Tominaga...

256
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,036
[in high-pitched voice]
Tominaga, are you okay?

257
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,738
[chuckles] What are you talking about?

258
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:04,009
Okami's got to be up to something
if he called us out here, right?

259
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,110
Mmm.

260
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,080
I felt better after eating the udon.

261
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,115
So, I'm all good.

262
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,750
Got it.

263
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,152
[Mikami] Sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

264
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,287
- No worries.
- Shall we go?

265
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,996
[Mikami] Mom.

266
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,200
Kota, you came?

267
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,868
I want you to meet some people.

268
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,973
These are my students,
Tominaga and Tsugimoto.

269
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,343
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

270
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,984
Mom, can we talk outside for a bit?

271
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,634
Would you mind listening too?

272
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,038
I think it's time I finally deal
with something I've been...

273
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,373
putting off for far too long.

274
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,610
Will you stay with me while I face it?

275
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,018
This place is one
of my mother's favorite places.

276
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,167
[wheelchair brake clanks]

277
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,523
Hey, Mom.

278
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,829
I'm Takashi.

279
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,699
Do you understand?

280
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,968
Takashi.

281
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,371
What are you saying?

282
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,139
You're Kota.

283
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,610
Kota...

284
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,082
he died...

285
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,685
twenty-two years ago.

286
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,791
If it was what you needed, Mom...

287
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,528
if it made you feel better...

288
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,066
I was okay with being Kota.

289
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,571
But...

290
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,576
that was a lie.

291
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,281
Every time...

292
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,254
you called me Kota...

293
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,529
it felt like I couldn't breathe.
[voice breaks]

294
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,101
[inhales deeply] That's how much it hurt.

295
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,908
I knew I had to face it.

296
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,145
That's what I thought.

297
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,756
I am...

298
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,127
Takashi Mikami.

299
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,734
Kota Mikami died.

300
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,408
I'm the one who killed him.

301
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,311
It's not your fault, Mom.

302
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,148
Kota...

303
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,785
my big brother...

304
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,556
made that choice himself.

305
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,060
No.

306
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,398
It was all my fault.

307
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,802
Mom.

308
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,273
I...

309
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,047
I've always lived as if I were living
for both Kota and myself.

310
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,856
It's always...

311
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,293
been that way.

312
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,398
And it always will.

313
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,216
Takashi?

314
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,736
That's right.

315
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,440
I'm Takashi.

316
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,979
[gentle piano music plays]

317
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,397
[sniffles]

318
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,974
[Tominaga] I'm going
to talk with Ryu-chan.

319
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,613
[Mikami] But...

320
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:17,949
Yes?

321
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,852
...I think probably...

322
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,923
the next time...

323
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,193
I see my mom...

324
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,563
she'll act like nothing happened...

325
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,334
and just call me Kota again.

326
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,104
Your brother...

327
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,775
might not respond
the way you hope he will either.

328
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,612
You understand that, right?

329
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,883
I do.

330
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,688
I know that his feelings
and his words don't always match.

331
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,592
I understand that.

332
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,963
If even we struggle with that...

333
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:11,403
then it's probably much harder
for Ryu-chan.

334
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,310
But...

335
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:23,582
today...

336
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:31,489
I just want to say,
"I love you, Ryu-chan."

337
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,894
[sniffles] I adore him

338
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,763
I love him so much.

339
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,435
But I've never been able to say it.

340
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,506
And that's...

341
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,744
what hurt the most.

342
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,047
[stirring orchestral music playing]

343
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,483
If the next time...

344
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,519
you see her...

345
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,290
she were to call you Kota again...

346
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,665
you'd still be glad you told her,
wouldn't you, Okami?

347
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,369
I would.

348
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,876
Mmm!

349
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,278
[sniffles]

350
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,781
[sniffles]

351
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,687
- What the heck, Jigen?
- [both chuckle]

352
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,393
- What the heck, Okami?
- [Mikami laughs].

353
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,995
- I'm good.
- Here you go, Okami.

354
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,699
[music swells]

355
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,339
[Tsugimoto] You know,
it's kind of amazing.

356
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,107
What's this about?

357
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,277
If I'm going to be a prosecutor

358
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,479
I need to learn more
about how different people live.

359
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,616
You'll make a great legal professional.

360
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,317
[chuckles] Huh?

361
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,721
If you don't know love,
it's a job you probably can't do

362
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,724
one that you shouldn't do.

363
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,897
Whoa, you suddenly dumped
a lot of pressure on me.

364
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,300
- I can walk alone from here.
- Oh, okay.

365
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,705
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

366
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,343
[chuckles]

367
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,081
[male student 1] Miyazawa, Fuyuki,
did you pass the AO exam?

368
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,717
- [male student 2] Yeah, kind of.
- [male student 3] What about you?

369
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,219
[male student 4] I've changed gears
and am focusing on the Common Test now.

370
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,888
[male student 1] So you didn't pass?

371
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,157
Did something happen?

372
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,327
Wakui's too popular.
I haven't gotten my turn yet.

373
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,497
Guess I have no choice.
You'll have to help me, Okami.

374
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,299
That's no way to ask for help.

375
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,335
Then be as nice as Wakui.

376
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,838
Jeez. So what don't you get?

377
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,673
The inverse image method...

378
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,541
- I've mostly recovered.
- That's good.

379
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:08,079
Oh, Ms. Koreeda.
Do you also teach classical Chinese?

380
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,749
I do! In fact, I'd be happy to.

381
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,918
Okay, everyone lost in classical Chinese,
gather round Ms. Koreeda!

382
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,787
- Yes!
- Let's go. Let's do it.

383
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,422
- Wanna try something else?
- Yeah.

384
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,193
- Good morning, Tominaga!
- Good morning!

385
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,461
How did it go?

386
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,930
It was pretty emotional.

387
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,333
Oh wow, that's great.

388
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35,540
[chuckles]

389
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,809
[Mikami] For the specified X and Y pair

390
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,345
check if a T exists
that meets the condition.

391
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,848
- Good job.
- What?

392
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,251
- Congrats!
- Yay!

393
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,689
The attitude of agreeing
with one's lord...

394
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,658
Wait, hey, listen.

395
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,327
Pointing out mistakes
and correcting them...

396
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,264
- Your handwriting sucks.
- Huh?

397
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,100
- Write properly.
- My handwriting?

398
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:05,937
Begin.

399
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,706
[paper rustles]

400
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,707
- [school bell chimes]
- Stop.

401
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:49,814
[Kanzaki] Okami.

402
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,255
Tomorrow, Yuzuru
is meeting with Ms. Saejima.

403
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,991
Are you going to be there?

404
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:01,726
Yes.

405
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,761
I see.

406
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,364
Let's do a post-test review, Kanzaki!

407
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,066
Uh, okay.

408
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,136
Excuse me.

409
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,538
[male student] Come on.

410
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,574
Thanks to you, I was able
to nail the essay questions.

411
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,243
- [Kanzaki] That's good.
- [chuckles]

412
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,313
[Kodai] About the other day...

413
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,384
I'd like for you
to take over for Mizohata.

414
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:30,321
and help make Rintoku
an even better school.

415
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,691
Thank you.

416
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,630
I'd like you to meet
with Nakaoka next time.

417
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,731
Of course.

418
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,734
When that time comes,
there's something I'd like to ask of you.

419
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,535
Yes.

420
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,773
I'll be in touch.

421
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,378
- [cell phone buzzes]
- [suspenseful music playing]

422
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,014
Hello, Tsukada speaking.

423
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,016
I spoke with Mikami.

424
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,852
And what did he say?

425
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,387
- [Kodai] He accepted the offer.
- [door beeps]

426
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,392
So you're choosing Mikami.

427
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:12,964
[Kodai] Yes. Regarding Secretary Azuma,
we hope he'll handle the damage control.

428
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:17,435
I also got word from Nakaoka
that Makino's no good.

429
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:19,904
Because of his jealousy
toward Mikami-kun

430
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,473
he's turning into Mizohata. [chuckles]

431
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,143
Anyone without a vision

432
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,080
for education needs to step aside.

433
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,649
Talk to you soon.

434
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,988
[breathes deeply]

435
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,025
[Mikami] It's just as I thought.

436
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,095
If they want to revise
the national budget estimates

437
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,363
they need to act now.

438
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,332
He is trying to win me over.

439
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,233
- It'll get soggy.
- Huh?

440
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,935
[slurping]

441
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,504
If you let ramen this good go soggy...

442
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,041
you'll get bad luck.

443
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,753
I believe Mr. Mizohata

444
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,155
will come around.

445
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,528
When I joined,
he was passionate about education.

446
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,699
But somewhere along the way,
he changed.

447
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:29,340
Many people have become victims
of Chairman Kodai's ideal of education.

448
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,843
Like baboons.

449
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:38,649
Baboons pretend to kindly warn
the gazelles of an approaching lion

450
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,652
then once the gazelles
let their guard down

451
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,621
the baboons eat their babies.

452
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,593
Well, to Chairman Kodai, his ideal
of education probably isn't a lie.

453
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,461
After all, there really
is a lion out there.

454
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,630
Yeah, that's true.

455
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,833
And thinking it's better
than being eaten by the lion

456
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,269
he eats the gazelle's children himself.

457
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,140
- Good, isn't it?
- What?

458
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,175
This ramen.

459
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,210
OFF HALF DAY

460
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,713
Makino-san, are you leaving for the day?

461
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,050
Yeah, Tsubuki is having surgery today

462
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,986
and his wife's been in labor
since yesterday.

463
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,954
You're taking half a day off for that?

464
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,458
That's right, I'm taking
half a day off for that.

465
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,104
[door opens]

466
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,140
[footsteps approaching]

467
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:52,824
[door closes]

468
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,337
Listen...

469
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,140
What is it?

470
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,313
I didn't want to forget

471
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,550
what I wanted to say so I wrote it down.

472
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,722
[paper rustles]

473
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,896
First...

474
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,269
I won't see you anymore.

475
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:39,971
[Kanzaki] What?

476
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,139
[Mayama] Second...

477
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,675
Mom...

478
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,513
please forget about me.

479
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,415
Third...

480
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,786
I'm the one who killed...

481
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,090
Yusuke Shibutani.

482
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,758
Yuzuru...

483
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,026
[Mayama] Fourth...

484
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,032
it's not your fault.

485
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,669
- Yuzuru, stop.
- Fifth...

486
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,479
I'm really...

487
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,316
sorry.

488
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,454
- Yuzuru, listen...
- [paper rustles]

489
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,923
That's everything.

490
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,735
[Kanzaki] Yuzuru...

491
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,340
I understand.

492
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,810
I really do, but...

493
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,879
This is between me and my mother.

494
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,688
[Kanzaki] Yuzuru, listen.

495
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,856
[melancholy music playing]

496
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,125
Everyone here...

497
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,029
carries some kind of guilt.

498
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,369
A guilt that can't be shared
with anyone else.

499
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,307
That guilt doesn't go away.

500
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,479
Because no matter what we do

501
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,282
Yusuke Shibutani isn't coming back.

502
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,320
But...

503
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,691
I know...

504
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,997
how much it means
for Ms. Saejima to be here.

505
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,268
I...

506
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,405
do know that.

507
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,675
[melancholic music continues]

508
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,452
[Saejima] I understand
what you're trying to say.

509
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,658
I think I understand.

510
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,764
You want to take responsibility
on your own.

511
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,503
Kanzaki-kun and...

512
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,206
Mr. Mikami...

513
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,146
they taught you that, didn't they?

514
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,017
[music swells]

515
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,521
And yet, I thought
if I just sacrificed myself

516
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,757
that would be enough.

517
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,928
I left you all alone.

518
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,134
I told myself it was all for you.

519
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,838
That it was all for my students.

520
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,775
But I never stopped to see
that setting that kind of example...

521
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,614
as a mother and as a teacher

522
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,950
was the worst thing

523
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,853
I could have done.

524
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,058
And I...

525
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,428
pushed you to the edge.

526
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,737
I'll think carefully about what you said.

527
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,507
But please, just one more time...

528
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,745
I want to talk with you.

529
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,358
- [male student 1] Wow...
- [male student 2] What is it?

530
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,528
[male student 3] The results from
the mock exam the other day are out.

531
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,564
[male student 1] Class 3-2
had an unbelievable jump.

532
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,566
[male student 2] Whoa, you're right.
That's amazing.

533
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,169
- [male student 1] It's wild, right?
- [male student 3] Even geography went up.

534
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,704
[male student 1] That's awesome.

535
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,572
[indistinct chatter]

536
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,777
Mr. Mikami, everyone said
their rankings improved.

537
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,812
It looks like your head's
still on your shoulders.

538
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,748
Yeah, I came back from the guillotine.

539
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,150
[students laugh]

540
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,987
All right! Let's get started!

541
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,288
[all laugh]

542
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,257
All right, let's do this!

543
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,225
- Let's give it a shot.
- Yeah.

544
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,961
[indistinct chatter]

545
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,297
This is amazing.

546
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,838
They're talking about studying, right?

547
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,774
Yeah.

548
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,110
- Should we start with math?
- Can we?

549
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,812
I didn't know something
like this was possible.

550
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,747
[male student] Geography?
What about geography?

551
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,218
Geography went up by, let's see...
seven points.

552
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,787
- [indistinct chatter]
- [airy music plays]

553
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,556
Right.

554
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,763
[dramatic music playing]

555
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,832
[Saejima] Thanks again for the other day.

556
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,433
Don't mention it.

557
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,237
If you hadn't been there,
I might've just left there

558
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,706
pretending to be a reasonable adult again.

559
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,711
When you're my age,
even if you want to change

560
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,046
it's not easy.

561
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,252
It's hard for people to change, period.

562
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,388
It's not about age.

563
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,526
Yeah, you're right.

564
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,500
This is the first time you reached out.

565
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:46,971
Um...

566
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,874
Here.

567
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,483
Huh? What's this?

568
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,786
Aren't you going to look
at what's on here?

569
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,323
Yeah, but Okami said to wait.

570
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,392
They should be here soon.

571
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,327
Huh? Someone's coming?

572
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,962
I don't know who it is either.

573
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,864
[knocking]

574
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,332
[door opens]

575
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,769
Yamato Takeru is here.

576
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,137
Huh?

577
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,405
What are you talking about?

578
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,574
He said you'd know.

579
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,309
What's that about?

580
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:31,815
Huh?

581
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,119
What?

582
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,622
Wait, seriously?!

583
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,957
Let me introduce you.

584
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,892
This is my colleague
from the Ministry of Education

585
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,662
Kyosuke Makino.

586
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,264
Also known as Yamato Takeru.

587
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,267
Nice to meet you. I'm Makino.

588
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,303
What's going on?

589
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:54,772
Makino and I are colleagues

590
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:58,108
and while I've been investigating Rintoku

591
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,977
Makino has been tracking
any movements within the ministry.

592
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,012
So you've been working together
from the start?

593
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,447
Pretty much.

594
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,783
I thought we promised no more secrets?

595
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,818
This really is the last one.

596
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,687
Ugh, you bureaucrats are so irritating!

597
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,323
You must be Tominaga.

598
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,791
Yeah, is there a problem?

599
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,026
I heard you gave Okami
a piece of your mind.

600
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,431
Which means you're the landlord,
right, Jigen?

601
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,401
And you must be Kanzaki.

602
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,569
Nice to meet you.

603
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,706
So much for privacy, huh?

604
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:30,608
I've been looking forward
to meeting you all.

605
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,944
Let's look at the data.

606
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,249
She gave it all to me,
including the reason...

607
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,553
it couldn't be shared before.

608
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,088
This is?

609
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,357
It's the data I took. All of it.

610
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,627
But you said there wasn't any proof.

611
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,562
There was a reason
I couldn't bring it out.

612
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,032
[suspenseful music playing]

613
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,902
Itsuki Tokura wasn't the only one
you were protecting.

614
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,139
Giving this to you will place
a heavy burden on your shoulders.

615
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,610
But I've chosen to trust you.

616
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,447
I see.

617
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,386
- Hey, Lupin. Let's do this.
- [computer beeps]

618
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,555
- [Lupin in English] Gotcha!
- [in Japanese] The names on this list...

619
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,525
They're probably the reason
she couldn't release it.

620
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,263
[gunfire effect echoes]

621
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,800
So these are the students
who were fraudulently admitted?

622
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,369
There aren't as many as I expected.

623
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,673
Even if it's the top school
in the prefecture, this isn't Tokyo

624
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,274
so it's probably about right.

625
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:40,944
Huh?

626
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,951
Sis, dinner's ready.

627
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,721
[tense music playing]

628
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,966
Coming.

629
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,105
[Tominaga] Chigira?

630
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,208
[door closes]

631
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,690
PREVIEW OF THE FINAL EPISODE

632
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,026
We can finally expose
the full scope of Rintoku's corruption.

633
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,095
[man 1]
Here's Yamato Takeru's assignment.

634
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,764
Photos, audio data, witnesses...
All of it is there.

635
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,165
[man 2] All the dots have been connected.

636
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,600
[Koreeda] The school took the freedom
away from you.

637
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,102
- [man 3] I am involved too.
- [man 4] It's finally starting.

638
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,337
[man 5] It's a fight for the survival
of Japan's education.

639
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:44,007
[Mikami] This year was way more difficult
than I ever imagined.

640
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,844
But every time, you all came up
with solutions that defied belief.

641
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,479
[woman] Our students
are leaving this school now.

642
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,747
Congratulations on your graduation.
