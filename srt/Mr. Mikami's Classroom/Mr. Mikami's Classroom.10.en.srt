1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,071
SIX YEARS AGO...

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:11,044
THE TAKAMI FAMILY

3
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,056
Can you please leave?

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,732
I sincerely apologize.

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,469
[man] It's all your fault.

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,776
- Please go.
- [woman sobbing]

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,077
Please leave!

8
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,246
- [brother] Stop! Calm down.
- Please go!

9
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,814
Please go!

10
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,283
Let's go.

11
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,824
[Mikami] Why did you come?

12
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,828
Takami worked directly under me.

13
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,732
[Mikami] You must understand
how his parents feel, right?

14
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,407
I'm the one who killed Takami.

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,617
[sobs]

16
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,689
[Mikami] You know...

17
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,760
that regret will probably last
the rest of your life.

18
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,398
It's easy to say it wasn't your fault.

19
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,801
But hearing that just makes it
harder for you, doesn't it?

20
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,941
From here on out...

21
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,212
It's going to be more painful
than you think.

22
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,686
I'll be here for you.

23
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,589
So live.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,496
[gentle piano music playing]

25
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,065
Huh?

26
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,503
Were we that close?

27
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,706
Idiot. We'll be that close from now on.

28
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,474
What the hell is that?

29
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,154
It's all our responsibility.

30
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,528
There are people who end their own lives.

31
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,465
And there are those who drive them to it.

32
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,509
I think that's the responsibility
of the education administration.

33
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,516
Offering incense and calling it
closure is meaningless.

34
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,822
There's no point
if it's just a fight for revenge.

35
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:27,507
It's a fight for the survival
of Japan's education.

36
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,177
Right?

37
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:44,624
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

38
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,094
You're absolutely right, but...

39
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,064
at the time, that was really tough for me.

40
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,599
[Tominaga] I get it.

41
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,101
Oh? You understand?

42
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,705
[Tominaga] Attacking a fragile person
with righteous logic from above...

43
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,106
that's Okami's signature move.

44
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,141
That's so mean.

45
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,846
But I was saved.

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,917
If it weren't for Mikami,
I wouldn't be here now.

47
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,188
[Makino] So with that as the backdrop...

48
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,192
With Mikami out in the field and
me in the Ministry of Education...

49
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,328
we decided to gather evidence.

50
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,475
[suspenseful music playing]

51
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,684
Here's Yamato Takeru's assignment.

52
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,088
[Makino] Bugging devices nowadays
sure are impressive.

53
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,324
They can record continuously
for 200 hours.

54
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,796
Anyway, I got a call from
Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma.

55
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,698
It doesn't sound like good news.

56
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,101
His granddaughter refuses to attend
any school but Rintoku.

57
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,638
He wants a backdoor in.
"Force it open." That's the order.

58
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,375
Isn't this decisive evidence?

59
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,044
But wiretapping is...

60
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,280
This person is surprisingly cautious.

61
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,550
He only holds secret meetings
at the same bar, in the same seat.

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,319
Makino, you're getting carried
away and talking too much.

63
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,521
Well, of course I'm getting carried away.

64
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,425
Mikami here was legendary
at the Ministry of Education

65
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,093
as being completely unapproachable.

66
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,496
I've been wondering
what kind of people could manage

67
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,832
to get that close to him
in such a short time.

68
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,802
Mr. Makino, do I detect
a hint of jealousy?

69
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,303
- [Makino] Can you tell?
- [chuckling]

70
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,873
If we combine Makino's data
with the data we gathered

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,776
we can finally expose
the full scope of Rintoku's corruption.

72
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,146
Give me a day, and I can compile the data.

73
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,116
[Lupin chimes]
I'm counting on you, Jigen.

74
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,317
Leave it to me.

75
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,887
About this case...

76
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,959
would you let me handle it for now?

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,861
Are you going to
write an article about it?

78
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,497
Before that, there's
something I have to do.

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,736
There are still current students
on this list, aside from Chigira.

80
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,872
[Kanzaki] That's why Ms. Saejima
couldn't act.

81
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,641
[Koreeda] Using students like this...

82
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,210
it's unforgivable.

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,648
I'll talk to Chigira.

84
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,686
That's a good idea.

85
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,862
[Mikami] It's been a while, hasn't it?

86
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,499
Deceiving the enemy starts
with deceiving your own side.

87
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,935
Remember how we staged
that fight in front of Tsubuki?

88
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,238
You got that position
by selling me out, didn't you?

89
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,572
I should congratulate you.

90
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,308
[Makino] The next time we see him,
we owe him an apology.

91
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,644
He's going to be so pissed.

92
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,783
- Still, it's impressive.
- Huh? What?

93
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,151
I'm talking about your students.

94
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,386
Is that what high school
seniors are like now?

95
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,889
Honestly, I'm surprised too.

96
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,290
Right?

97
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,227
Especially... Tominaga, was it?
How many lives has she lived?

98
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,463
[laughs]
This is her first life.

99
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,034
She's living her one and only life
with more intensity than anyone.

100
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,342
Tsk. Ah, damn it, only you
get the good moments.

101
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,817
[Mikami] Yeah, I did feel a bit bad
for you partway, through.

102
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,819
[Makino chuckles]

103
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,290
[Mikami]
But the real battle starts now.

104
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,794
[Makino] What will Kanzaki do?

105
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,901
[Mikami] I always tell Ms. Koreeda
to be patient and wait.

106
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,939
But all I can think now is,
"What can I do to help?"

107
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,480
Are students really that lovable?

108
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,883
Let me tell you...

109
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,019
they really are, actually.

110
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,821
[laughing]

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,524
Now that's just annoying.

112
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,960
[Makino] Ugh, it's cold.

113
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,665
[Makino] It's finally starting...

114
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,736
the battle for the survival
of Japan's education.

115
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,372
[Mikami] The goal isn't just
to expose corruption.

116
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,542
If the educational system doesn't
change, it's meaningless.

117
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,043
Yeah.

118
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,648
We start with Plan Okami Three.

119
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,751
What's that? Sounds interesting.

120
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,620
Let's hear it.

121
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,924
[Koreeda] The person who came to
consult you, saying it might have

122
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,826
been an illegitimate admission
was Chigira, wasn't it?

123
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,635
I thought she'd be a lively kid,
but she was really withdrawn.

124
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:01,607
But around age 15, personalities
can change dramatically

125
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,376
so I thought maybe that was it.

126
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,114
But that wasn't it, was it?

127
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,119
She was changed by the actions of adults.

128
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:22,528
I think Chigira worked really hard
after entering this school.

129
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,598
[Koreeda] She's now one of the top
students in the class.

130
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,800
[Isshiki] But even after
working that hard

131
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,003
she's suffering because
she can't accept herself.

132
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,575
I'll never forget Chiriga's face
at that moment.

133
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,447
[indistinct chatter]

134
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,685
[Kanzaki] Chigira.

135
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,753
What is it?

136
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,190
Can I have a moment?

137
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
Sure.

138
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,914
I... knew.

139
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,587
I knew I got into Rintoku
through dishonest means.

140
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,660
If you want to write an article,
then go right ahead.

141
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,898
But if the truth comes out,
at the very least

142
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,902
your father won't be able
to continue as a politician.

143
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,139
- So...
- You need my permission?

144
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,445
[Kanzaki]
I know what I'm doing is really cruel.

145
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,348
But...

146
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,452
I want us to think about it together.

147
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,528
Sorry, I can't.

148
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,154
Did you talk to Kanzaki?

149
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,657
You knew?

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,862
[airy choral music playing]

151
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,802
If quitting school were enough
to fix this, I wouldn't hesitate.

152
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,773
But I have a younger sister.

153
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,278
And...

154
00:11:55,014 --> 00:12:00,453
Besides me, there must be other
students still enrolled, too, right?

155
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,957
That's true.

156
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,496
It's impossible to just decide what to do.

157
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,503
[Koreeda] It's okay to run away...

158
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,642
is what I wish I could tell you.

159
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,713
But you can't find a place
to run to, can you?

160
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,785
[Chigira] It would ruin
my little sister's life.

161
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,692
And everyone else's.

162
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,197
I'm scared.

163
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,305
I can't forgive this.

164
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,913
Chigira, your life is yours to choose.

165
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,820
But the school
took that freedom away from you.

166
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:17,296
And I bear responsibility too,
for not realizing it.

167
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,572
Chigira.

168
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,811
I know that there is
no regret-free option.

169
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,649
But...

170
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,686
what's already happened can't be changed.

171
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,824
Only the time that's ahead of you
can make a difference.

172
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,331
It's frustrating.

173
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,904
But I don't want to give up.

174
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,108
I won't give up, either.

175
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,078
It's the only thing I can do.

176
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,416
Let's see it through,
together, until the end.

177
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,995
[Tsugimoto]
So, this guy, Nakaoka

178
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,164
is the one they call,
"the shadow fixer."

179
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,133
He passed requests
for illegitimate admissions

180
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,203
from Nagatacho to Mr. Mizohata
through Mr. Tsukada.

181
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,307
[Tsugimoto] In return, Rintoku
received not only donations

182
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,912
from the illegitimate students,
but also massive subsidies.

183
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,214
What do the bureaucrats stand to gain?

184
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,884
Mr. Tsukada should never
have been promoted that high

185
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,719
in the first place.

186
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,155
[Mikami] I heard the Cabinet Personnel
Bureau pushed his promotion through.

187
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,191
I see.

188
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:57,596
Rintoku's information was
compiled in Ms. Saejima's data.

189
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,933
[Kanzaki] She was forced
to help coordinate the fraud

190
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,835
after she tried to protect Itsuki Tokura.
Her colleague, Tsutsui, caught on

191
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,672
to what she was doing
and made advances on her.

192
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,875
And after it was exposed
through my newspaper article

193
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,677
she was offered a transfer

194
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,913
to a cram school run by Rintoku.

195
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,147
But she declined, believing

196
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,382
she couldn't continue

197
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,083
being part of the corruption.

198
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,552
[Koreeda] I have something, too.

199
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,622
I got the cram school's ledgers

200
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,558
and some old photos from Tokui,
the former external auditor

201
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,596
and tax accountant,
who had kept them just in case.

202
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,832
[Koreeda] It seems they've received
donations from companies

203
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,935
known for shady,
though not criminal, practices.

204
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,236
Also...

205
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,843
Chairman Kodai and Mr. Tsukada
appear to be longtime acquaintances.

206
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,646
By the way, this is
Representative Chigira.

207
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,748
[group murmurs]

208
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,919
Bravo.

209
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,921
All the dots have been connected.

210
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,723
- Incredible.
- [Tominaga laughs]

211
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,359
What's so funny?

212
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,163
Come on, you're just got
way too much "final boss" energy.

213
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,566
Can't be helped.
I am Yamato Takeru, after all.

214
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,002
Wait, what time is it?

215
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,471
- Oh, it's seven.
- Shoot! I have to go home.

216
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,106
Is it about Ryu-chan?

217
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,276
Yep. I'm really glad we made up

218
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,645
but now if I don't get home by eight,
he gets seriously mad.

219
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,146
Talk about demanding.

220
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,582
- You're totally loving it, though.
- It's just me gushing.

221
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,285
Anyway, I'm off. Later, Mr. Makino!

222
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,855
Ta-da!

223
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,558
Mom sent some late-night snacks with love.

224
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,626
I told her not to. I'll gain weight.

225
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,730
[sister] If that's how you feel,
maybe I'll take it, then.

226
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,100
- Want to split it?
- Really?

227
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:46,071
Yay! Which one should I choose?

228
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,109
- Let me take this one.
- Then I'll have this one.

229
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,410
Thanks.

230
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,347
Mmm!

231
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,783
It's delicious.

232
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,757
- You're amazing, sis.
- Huh?

233
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,393
Solving problems like this?
That's so cool.

234
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,196
Not at all. It's normal.

235
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,333
I'm taking the entrance exams next year.

236
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,969
So I'll have you teach me lots and lots

237
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,605
because I'm definitely going to Rintoku.

238
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,811
Yeah.

239
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,784
Sis, what's wrong?

240
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,585
Oh, nothing.

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,089
- But...
- Really, it's nothing.

242
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,391
[chuckles]
You've got food on your face.

243
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,895
Yum!

244
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,432
Think I can solve this one?

245
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,133
[Koreeda] She said she's fine with
whatever happens to her, but she's worried

246
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,136
about her family and underclassmen
who also might be involved.

247
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,106
Isn't there anything we can do?

248
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,843
[Mikami] For example, if we struck
a secret deal with Chairman Kodai

249
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,145
we can get a promise
that this won't happen again.

250
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,514
We could just make it all go away.

251
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,550
[Koreeda]
But even if we did that

252
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,152
Chigira would still
have that hanging over her.

253
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,287
[Mikami] True.

254
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,658
And if we managed to figure
this out, someone else could too.

255
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,393
Does that mean...

256
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,463
Makino got some probing questions
from a journalist acquaintance

257
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,466
about political connections
to Rintoku.

258
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,536
That case with Yuzuru Mayama
drew too much attention.

259
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,704
That's not good.

260
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,875
We don't have hard evidence,
so it may not blow up right away

261
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,478
but if an article were to come out,
it'll be too late.

262
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:37,549
And that article will be
full of things that will hurt people.

263
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,552
The media has no obligation
to coddle to those individuals.

264
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,421
[Koreeda] That's just cruel.

265
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,823
[Mikami] Let's think.

266
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,835
HARUKA CHIGIRA

267
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,911
[Koreeda] Mr. Mizohata,
you're free for fourth period, right?

268
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,847
Yes, and what of it?

269
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,451
Mr. Mikami is giving a special lesson.

270
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,923
It's a class to face Chigira head-on.

271
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,942
There's something I want to think
through with all of you today.

272
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,224
This whole year, I've been teaching
about the power of thought.

273
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,294
So what do you think
it really means to "think"?

274
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,033
- [chalk tapping]
- Isn't it logical reasoning?

275
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,874
[chalk tapping]

276
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,148
[Mikami] "I think this because of that."

277
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,351
Being able to clearly explain
your reasoning is important.

278
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,154
That's what's expected in essay exams.

279
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,525
But I think that's also the limit
of the kind of thinking

280
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,360
that you're taught for tests.

281
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,031
"Is war a bad thing?"

282
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,934
That's actually
a deceptively easy question.

283
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,238
- [Mikami] Shiiba.
- Yes?

284
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,872
[Mikami] What would you say?

285
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,941
Uh...

286
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:51,250
War unjustly takes human lives.

287
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,619
So it's wrong and should not happen.

288
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,120
[Mikami] Exactly.

289
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,689
But what if we phrased
the question like this?

290
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,894
[chalk tapping]

291
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,501
IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A JUST WAR?

292
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,940
Most people would probably say
such wars don't exist.

293
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,342
But can you still say that

294
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,745
after studying
the history of specific wars?

295
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,548
Invasions, terrorism, dictatorships...

296
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,119
Do you think using force
to resist those is wrong?

297
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,126
Think about it.

298
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,839
If we consider that war is,
in principle, wrong

299
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,142
then maybe no war is truly just.

300
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,911
But there are cases where
armed conflict is unavoidable.

301
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,946
We can't deny that.

302
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,418
Right. But doesn't saying that "armed
conflict is sometimes unavoidable"

303
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:03,255
contradict the idea
that war is always wrong?

304
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:09,561
And who decides whether
it was "unavoidable" anyway?

305
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,337
I don't know.

306
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:27,346
But surely, there are soldiers our age

307
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,450
wishing someone would tell them,
"You're not wrong"

308
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,353
as they fight with guns in hand.

309
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:42,060
[Sakurai] That's why war has to end.

310
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,364
[Mikami] I get that.

311
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,734
But it's not that easy to eliminate war.

312
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,535
Do you know why?

313
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,740
[Sakurai] Only vaguely.

314
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,642
[Mikami] When thinking about war

315
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,813
I believe we must not avert our eyes
from a fundamental truth.

316
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,651
[Mikami] That is,
war happens between nations.

317
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,489
In other words, it's a policy decision
made by governments.

318
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,391
That's an undeniable fact.

319
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,031
War is something decided by politics.

320
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,635
By the representatives we elect
through voting...

321
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,072
which means, it's essentially our will.

322
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:34,246
With your vote,
you might be able to stop a war.

323
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,383
Of course, sometimes that vote
may amount to nothing.

324
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,621
But it's certain that "Love & Peace"
alone won't stop war.

325
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,058
[Mikami] This is just one example.

326
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,295
The world is full
of complicated, difficult

327
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,801
unanswerable questions.

328
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
A vulture and a girl.

329
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,472
Poverty and terrorism. Euthanasia.

330
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:05,377
Thinking about those things
is extremely painful, isn't it?

331
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,417
The ability to think
isn't just about finding answers.

332
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,688
It's about the strength
to keep thinking

333
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,257
even when no answer comes.

334
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
Let's keep thinking.

335
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,431
[bright music playing]

336
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,502
Run away.

337
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,286
[Chigira] I have one, too...

338
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,291
a question without an answer.

339
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,262
That is...

340
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:35,066
My father did something he shouldn't have.

341
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,139
And Kanzaki knows about it.

342
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,719
Kanzaki, you know...

343
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,423
I was happy.

344
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,029
You didn't ignore the fact that I'm here.

345
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,334
But Kanzaki...

346
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,071
you're going to become
a journalist, right?

347
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,910
If someone like me
is involved in a story...

348
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,983
can you choose not to report it?

349
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,662
I don't think so.

350
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,435
Right.

351
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,606
Because if you did,
you wouldn't be a real journalist.

352
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,410
[Kanzaki] But...

353
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:59,918
I'll never forget that you exist.

354
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,597
It hurts.

355
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,839
Even in this moment,
just talking about it...

356
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,445
I'm overwhelmed with guilt,
like I'm betraying my own family.

357
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,582
I just want to disappear.

358
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,187
It's so painful...

359
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:45,864
[gasping] I can't breathe.

360
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,735
[panting]

361
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,817
[morose music playing]

362
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,819
[sighs]

363
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,256
[Chigira sniffles] But...

364
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,868
If this truth were buried to protect me

365
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,541
I know I'd feel just as awful.

366
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,479
[Chigira] There is no escape.

367
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:41,786
So, the only choice is not to run.

368
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,391
Right?

369
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,526
[morose music continues]

370
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,166
[Chigira] Thank you.

371
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,042
So, Kanzaki...

372
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,748
do what I can't.

373
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,387
Think only about
what journalism should be.

374
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,693
Got it.

375
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,497
I promise I will.

376
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,602
[Chigira sniffles]

377
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,206
[morose music continues]

378
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,895
Regarding what Chigira just said...

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,802
I am involved too.

380
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,857
I had no idea that all of you were

381
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:31,863
fighting this hard in this classroom.

382
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,770
Because I couldn't bear the thought
of some bureaucrat-turned-teacher

383
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,674
achieving something I hadn't,
even after decades of teaching

384
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,910
I was obsessed with dragging him down.

385
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,715
[sighs]

386
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:06,297
But after seeing today's lesson

387
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:13,938
I've realized the only thing I lacked
was the faith to believe in you all.

388
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,145
At this point...

389
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:30,755
all I can do is serve as a cautionary
example of what not to become.

390
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,493
I'm sorry.

391
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,707
[somber music playing]

392
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,747
[door rumbles]

393
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,418
[muted footsteps fade]

394
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:14,666
[Mikami] This truth that Chigira-san
and Mr. Mizohata felt they had to

395
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,403
throw away their own lives
just to bring to light...

396
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,638
is right here.

397
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:29,080
I believe I have a duty to protect
this and deliver it to the world.

398
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:34,686
Anyone who doesn't want
to be involved can leave now.

399
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,625
There's no reason for you
to be dragged into this.

400
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:48,066
For those who remain,
let's protect this together.

401
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,986
[resolute music playing]

402
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,298
- [Kodai] Mr. Mizobata.
- It's "Mizohata."

403
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,868
[Kodai] We need those subsidies

404
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:28,172
in order to take this school
from elite to ultra-elite...

405
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,674
[Mizohata] I understand.

406
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,643
That's why I'm doing all this.

407
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,580
- [Kodai] Do you really understand?
- Yes.

408
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,183
[Kodai] Then contact Mr. Nakaoka
immediately and take action.

409
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,918
[Mizohata] Understood.

410
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,820
[Kodai] Please make it happen.

411
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,493
Kanzaki, I think it's good.

412
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,660
Good work, everyone.

413
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:51,796
[Kanzaki] Thanks.

414
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,967
- [pensive music playing]
- [faint whirring]

415
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,348
Dad. Look at this.

416
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,223
What's this?

417
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,629
I was wondering if your
newspaper could run it.

418
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,567
Impossible. It lacks credibility.

419
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,572
Photos, audio data, witnesses...
All of it is there.

420
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:42,313
[Kanzaki] If you won't publish it,
I'll take it to another paper.

421
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,253
[father] Is this true?

422
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,592
[Kanzaki] Within that data
one of my classmates is named.

423
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,231
I felt so sick with self-loathing
writing that article.

424
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:08,940
But Chigira said...

425
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:14,645
"Just focus on what
journalism is all about."

426
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:23,054
So I want you to think
only about that as well.

427
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,800
[officer] Mayama, you have a visitor.

428
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,704
[clicking, creaking]

429
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,373
[faint footsteps passing]

430
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,348
[Saejima] Listen.

431
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,252
Yeah?

432
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:02,260
I wanted to put it into words properly.

433
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,570
I wrote down the things
I need to tell you.

434
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,005
I don't want to miss anything.

435
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:25,049
[Saejima] First, I'll respect
your decision regarding visitation.

436
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:33,291
Second, I want your permission
to attend all trials

437
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,795
and take the stand if needed.

438
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:46,704
Third, until you've finished
your atonement

439
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:53,411
no matter what happens,
I will live a healthy life.

440
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,583
Mom...

441
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,754
Because I want to live
and see you again.

442
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,063
So you need to live too, Yuzuru.

443
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:15,766
I want you to atone
in every sense of the word.

444
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:24,275
I want you to truly understand
what it means to take a life.

445
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:31,115
No matter how much you writhe and suffer

446
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,220
I want you to understand that
some things can never be undone.

447
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,632
[sobs]

448
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,991
I'll do that too.

449
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,395
No matter where I am.

450
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,635
[Mayama] Mom...

451
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,605
What is it?

452
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,942
I...

453
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,616
I killed someone.

454
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,286
Yeah.

455
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,489
I killed someone.

456
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,164
Yes.

457
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,966
[sobbing] I really killed someone.

458
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,644
Mom...

459
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,489
ONE WEEK LATER...

460
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,160
[Kodai] As I mentioned before,
we've decided to ask Mr. Mikami

461
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,096
to take over the position.

462
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,832
Mikami has also promised
to continue supporting us

463
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,434
even after returning to
the Ministry of Education.

464
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,105
Oh no, we still need him here
for at least another two years.

465
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,339
I look forward to working with you.

466
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,341
Likewise.

467
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:43,280
So, Mikami, about that matter,
please explain it to Mr. Nakaoka.

468
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,084
So Representative Azuma
still refuses to back down

469
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,786
on the illicit admission?

470
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:50,855
He is quite prideful.

471
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,792
Yet he holds immense sway
over budget allocations.

472
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,560
If he interferes with the subsidy
review, both the national

473
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,462
and prefectural governments
will be forced to comply.

474
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,498
It would be disastrous.

475
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,534
Still, looking at the next fiscal year,
I believe the risks are too great

476
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,670
for both the Ministry and Rintoku.

477
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:11,642
Hmm? Mr. Tsukada,
this is not what we discussed.

478
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,344
Now, now.

479
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,379
Can you at least hear him out?

480
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,886
Remember last year's
political fundraiser scandal?

481
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,722
The former Chief Cabinet Secretary, Azuma

482
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,524
wasn't even mentioned as being involved.

483
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,127
But actually, I'm close
with one of the Diet members

484
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,663
in the Azuma faction.

485
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,366
When I nudged him a bit,
he grumbled that he was

486
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,502
under extreme pressure
to meet a strict quota.

487
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,041
- [rustling]
- [Mikami] This is his note.

488
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,511
If a significant amount
didn't go into Azuma's pocket

489
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,280
it wouldn't make sense, right?

490
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,851
Are you telling me
to threaten him with this?

491
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,653
Is that not acceptable?

492
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,521
My work is based on trust.

493
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,990
It is absolutely unacceptable.

494
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,126
Shall I step in and handle it?

495
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:07,364
It won't change anything if you do,
Rintoku equals me.

496
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,934
But there's no other way.

497
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,169
[Nakaoka] Hmm?

498
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,542
Are you saying this is the
collective will of all three of you?

499
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,682
Well, from my standpoint...
I can't allow my dear friend

500
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,819
Mr. Kodai, to walk such a dangerous path.

501
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:34,692
If my reputation in Nagatacho drops,
neither of you will be unscathed.

502
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,929
I've asked you many times
to find another way.

503
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,833
After indulging so much,
you've got a lot of nerve saying that.

504
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,735
[Kodai] Indulging...?

505
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,038
What exactly do you mean by "indulging"?

506
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,978
I have not spent a single yen
for personal gain.

507
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,815
Every single yen was used for
the sake of educational ideals.

508
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,184
That's how Rintoku became
the top school in the prefecture

509
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,519
in just 20 years.

510
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,491
I'm sick of it.

511
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,494
I'm sick of seeing the face
of someone like you

512
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,229
who has no ideals about education.

513
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,998
Excuse me?

514
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,303
Give me a break with those jokes!

515
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,008
[rapping]

516
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,744
[man] Sorry, it's a bit loud in here.

517
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:30,915
[Tsukada] What? Mikami, I thought
we reserved the entire annex.

518
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,517
Yes, that should be the case. I'm sorry.

519
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,618
What?

520
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,866
Makino...

521
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,069
Long time no see.

522
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,272
I was wondering why
I hadn't been invited lately.

523
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,141
Looks like you've chosen Mikami, huh?

524
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,342
I'm hurt.

525
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,811
What is going on?

526
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,349
You were all in on this together?

527
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,791
Mr. Mikami, explain yourself.

528
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,926
I'm sure you can figure it out.

529
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,164
An article will be published in
the Tohto Newspaper tomorrow.

530
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,033
What's this about?

531
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,337
It's a story about how the corrupt
relationship between Nagatacho

532
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,941
Kasumigaseki, and Rintoku
was cultivated by a shadow fixer

533
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,278
and how it led to the stabbing
of one innocent young man.

534
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,548
It's the story of a butterfly effect
no one could have seen coming.

535
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,652
Kanzaki wrote it
and entrusted it to his father.

536
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,520
It's autonomy in action.

537
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,892
You'll get to witness
the moment your education

538
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,394
bore a truly outstanding result.

539
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,132
- Since when...?
- From the very beginning.

540
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,668
I came to Rintoku for this very purpose.

541
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,005
Stop the article!

542
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,073
I can't do that.

543
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,476
What did you say?

544
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:09,380
My students thought hard, and suffered

545
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,717
and came to this conclusion.

546
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,354
Chigira herself, who was admitted
under fraudulent means

547
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,922
asked us to publish it.

548
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,093
Kanzaki answered that request
while barely holding himself together.

549
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,666
There's no way we could
choose to kill the story.

550
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,368
Don't you agree?

551
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,641
Because bureaucrats like you
can't create a proper education

552
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,512
I've had to swallow this filth
and do it myself!

553
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,215
Even if we just provide
a normal education...

554
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,185
Even if it's a good education...

555
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,954
The students still won't be
accepted once they enter society.

556
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,059
It's a society that

557
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,261
judges human worth solely
by the university you went to.

558
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,564
It was you, the education
authorities, who created that!

559
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,433
You don't have to tell me.

560
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,435
I'll spend the rest
of my life atoning for that...

561
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,236
by changing education.

562
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,673
Without me, Rintoku will fall apart,
as will its educational culture!

563
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,008
Unfortunately

564
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,245
schools don't collapse
just because the chairman changes.

565
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,485
The ideals you built for Rintoku
are wonderful, Mr. Kodai.

566
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,522
But do you really want to
protect those ideals at the cost

567
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,926
of harming students' lives?

568
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,063
If so, you're no different
from this country's system.

569
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,133
Is that the life
you intend to keep living?

570
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,575
This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.

571
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,748
This is Mr. Fujisaki from
the Metropolitan Police Department's

572
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:52,116
Second Investigation Division.

573
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,320
[Tsukada]
You bastards. You tricked me!

574
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,558
Yes. Plan Okami Three
has been activated.

575
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,761
What the hell is that?

576
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,496
Don't mess with me!

577
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,032
That's enough, Mr. Tsukada.

578
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,438
[tense music playing]

579
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,446
[Mikami] Mr. Kodai.

580
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:30,954
I promise I will protect
Rintoku Gakuin and its students.

581
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,579

BACKDOOR ADMISSIONS
AT RINTOKU GAKUIN EXPOSED!

584
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,796
COLLUSION WITH EDUCATION MINISTRY

585
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,867
BACKDOOR ADMISSION LIST
INCLUDES POLITICIAN'S CHILD!

586
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,404
[gasping]

587
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,693
[Kanzaki] We'll also begin a serialized
article in our group's magazine

588
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,361
featuring your story.

589
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:51,501
[Mayama] I wrote a letter
to Kanako Shibutani.

590
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,571
I see.

591
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,078
Kanzaki...

592
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:03,780
What?

593
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,019
About my mother...

594
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,157
It's fine.

595
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,596
I'll visit her as often as I can,
even if it annoys her.

596
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:25,369
I hope you get a reply someday.

597
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:34,311
It's wrong to wish for that.

598
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,615
Even so...

599
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,489
[Koreeda] So there's
no changing your mind?

600
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:46,990
No.

601
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,764
I just didn't want
to graduate from Rintoku.

602
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,403
Shiiba, did you know about
the high school equivalency exam?

603
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,241
I did. She's amazing, right?

604
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,177
Truly amazing.

605
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:13,083
I want to get into university on my own.

606
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,119
With everyone.

607
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,190
- With Shiiba.
- [both chuckle]

608
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,994
I want to start as a freshman
with confidence.

609
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,764
You can definitely do it, Chigira.

610
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:32,002
[Shiiba] Yeah. In fact, I have to work
hard too, so I'm not the one

611
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,971
who ends up behind you.

612
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,708
[announcer] Thank you for gathering today.

613
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,278
We'll begin the press conference
when it's time.

614
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,849
[Kodai] You told me my educational
ideals were wonderful.

615
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,952
But to realize those ideals

616
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,489
it's the country's system
that needs to change.

617
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:59,930
And yet, using "reality"
as an excuse, before I knew it

618
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,667
I myself had hopped onto
the rails of that very system.

619
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,304
I've swallowed enough mud.

620
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,879
Even so...

621
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,283
what the reporters really want
is a story

622
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,387
about a money-hungry villain
who turned education into a business.

623
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:30,193
And stories like this are
sometimes used as scapegoats

624
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:34,965
to cover up the inconvenient truths
a nation doesn't want exposed.

625
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:41,471
Well, if that could actually lead
to an upgrade in our country's

626
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:44,408
education system,
I'd gladly be the sacrificial lamb.

627
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,978
But unfortunately, it's never that simple.

628
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,981
I'll be forgotten, and

629
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:54,851
someone else will become
the next scapegoat.

630
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,289
This country keeps repeating
the same ridiculous farce.

631
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,427
However, the ideals
of Rintoku still live on

632
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,229
in the students you nurtured.

633
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:22,012
Society and education
aren't enemies to be defeated.

634
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:27,751
They are fragile,
vulnerable things we must protect.

635
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:33,190
[Mikami] All the more reason
we need to carefully cultivate them...

636
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,627
both people and institutions.

637
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:01,585
I look forward to seeing
true education reform

638
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,488
Mr. Mikami.

639
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,728
[momentous music playing]

I'm Masahide Kodai,
Chairman of Rintoku Gakuin.

00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:41,758
MARCH, 2025

THANK YOU, OKAMI AND MS. KOREEDA!

647
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:29,172
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR GRADUATION!
RINTOKU CLASS 3-2

648
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,249
Hey, congratulations on your graduation.

649
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:49,826
[Kanzaki] There's something
I want to ask you.

650
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,428
What is it?

651
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:56,266
Okami, you came to save me, didn't you?

652
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,569
I was curious, of course.

653
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,738
Huh?

654
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,574
Ms. Isshiki told me there was
a student similar to my brother.

655
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,643
And when I actually came and saw you

656
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,747
you really were just like him.
Honestly, I though, "Uh-oh..."

657
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,018
[Kanzaki] Looking back
on what I was thinking last year

658
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,520
I can only shake my head.

659
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,856
[chuckles] Yeah.

660
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,892
But now, my brother is my brother.

661
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,062
And I only see you as you.

662
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:33,003
Thinking deeply
is not easy on yourself at all.

663
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,338
But even so...

664
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,809
I'll never let go of it.

665
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,281
And one more thing.

666
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,382
What is it?

667
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,721
I won't die.

668
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,825
No matter what happens.

669
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:04,768
Make sure you don't.

670
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,942
There you are, Okami!

671
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,479
[student chatter]

672
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,257
[Mikami] Congratulations
on your graduation!

673
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,926
It was fun.

674
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,897
It was the most fun year of my life.

675
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,534
That's not fair! I was going to say that!

676
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,440
That goes for all of us.
Probably... everyone.

677
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,908
I'm glad to hear that.

678
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,142
[Sakurai] Don't blush.

679
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:47,410
Come on, how could I not?

680
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:55,819
It was the toughest year of my life,
constantly having to deny myself.

681
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,122
I know.

682
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:04,994
But it was also a year
where I came to believe

683
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,330
that people can change,
no matter how old they were.

684
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,167
Exactly. I learned that too.

685
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,939
Our precious students
are leaving this school now.

686
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,176
And the teachers
are the only ones left behind.

687
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,351
But that means we get to be
teachers again next year.

688
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:29,886
[Mikami] Yes.

689
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:42,465
Thank you for such a wonderful year.

690
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,169
[Mikami] Likewise.

691
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,305
Thank you so much.

692
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,075
[sentimental music playing]

693
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:59,549
Mr. Okami, can you please
give us a few final words?

694
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,451
Come on. That's embarrassing.

695
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,721
You think you can run from this?

696
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,123
- [laughter]
- Please say something.

697
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:10,827
Well...

698
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,870
[sighs]

699
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:02,712
This past year, there's only
one thing I kept telling you all.

700
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:07,650
"Think with your own head."

701
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:13,356
Every time I told you to think,
I was thinking too.

702
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:19,295
[Mikami] I kept thinking,
"I'm not sure I can do this."

703
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,700
Even though you always looked
like you had all the answers?

704
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,436
[Mikami] That's the one thing
we bureaucrats are good at.

705
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,971
[soft laughter]

706
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:33,943
This year was way more
difficult than I ever imagined.

707
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:39,716
[Mikami] But every time, you all came up
with solutions that defied belief.

708
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:45,588
You might not even realize it
yourselves, but...

709
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,258
for example, for Shinonome...

710
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,527
for Shiiba...

711
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:52,829
for Chigira...

712
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,733
Every single answer you came up with

713
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:01,504
each of those answers pulled
a huge national issue into the light.

714
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:14,050
You showed me
that such things were possible.

715
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,557
"The personal is political."

716
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,394
It was the perfect embodiment
of the phrase.

717
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,332
But you know, I also think...

718
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,605
[students murmuring]

719
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,708
[chalk tapping]

720
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,680
QUESTIONS WITHOUT AN ANSWER

721
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,115
A solution based on an outcome
is a wonderful thing.

722
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,618
But what's even more wonderful is

723
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,421
that within each of you,
there are countless questions.

724
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:54,757
Questions without clear answers,
that you're now confronting

725
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,627
with everything you've got.

726
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,265
Those questions
may feel overwhelming at times

727
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,067
even make you want to give up.

728
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,002
You may even face despair.

729
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:12,108
But if in those moments,
you can remember this...

730
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:20,550
That the questions are right here...

731
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,485
inside your own minds.

732
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,356
And that someone was looking
forward to seeing how you would

733
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,690
face them more than anyone else.

734
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,829
Because those unanswered
questions inside you

735
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,298
are the future itself.

736
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:42,405
And the answers you come up with,
even through suffering

737
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,910
will surely be ones
that stand with the weak.

738
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,857
[poignant music playing]

739
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,966
You guys can do it.

740
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:14,270
I believe in you.

741
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,247
Congratulations on your graduation.

742
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,252
[uplifting music playing]

743
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,665
[Mikami]
Why did you come all the way here?

744
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,700
I have two things to report.

745
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,335
What?

746
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,038
First, Tsubuki
has decided to work hard

747
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,673
at the Ministry of Education
for at least this year.

748
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,408
Is that right?

749
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,010
And second...

750
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:33,082
I've decided to study
for a teaching license

751
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,817
through a correspondence course.

752
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,920
- What? Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

753
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,890
I also somehow forced
the higher-ups to approve it.

754
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,259
[laughs] That's reckless.

755
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,094
I guess it is.

756
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,965
I mean, how will I even
do the student teaching?

757
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,367
I'll just have to figure it out.

758
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:58,141
We're both such education nerds.

759
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,078
Because if that part doesn't change

760
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,715
Japan won't change either.

761
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,385
That's right.

762
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,831
I only made it through this past year
thanks to you, Makino.

763
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:23,733
No.

764
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,370
It's thanks to your students.

765
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,514
Yeah, you're right.

766
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,086
[upbeat music playing]

767
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:06,042
[Mikami] It was a series of changes
so small you could almost overlook them.

768
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,913
[keys clicking]

769
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,784
- [woman] Tsubuki, can I have a moment?
- Yes.

770
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:19,555
[Mikami] That place probably
can't change all at once, either.

771
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:23,726
But alongside reckless challenges

772
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,862
you were always there.

773
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,166
Look. Birds.

774
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,901
Oh, yeah.

775
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:36,472
[Mikami] There were probably
far too many things

776
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,974
I couldn't have accomplished without you.

777
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:48,684
It's probably a common twist
in stories like this...

778
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,386
thinking you're the shield, when, in fact

779
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:51,854
you're the one being shielded.

780
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,235
[clerk] Court is now in session.

781
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:08,671
Defendant, please come
before the witness stand.

782
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,490
[Mikami] In order to fully
bear the weight of your crime

783
01:05:28,157 --> 01:05:30,192
you are standing there now,
carrying the heart

784
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,794
you finally reclaimed.

785
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,281
And once again, I return
to the same question.

786
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,384
"What is education?"

787
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,538
[Mikami] And so...

788
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,042
I move forward.

789
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:21,537
"The personal is political."
The personal is political.

790
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,139
From now on, I will never look away again.

791
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,340
I promise.

792
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,942
Think.
