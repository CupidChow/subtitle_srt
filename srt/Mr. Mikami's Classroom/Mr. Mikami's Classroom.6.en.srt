1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,939
[student] Takashi,
something awful has happened!

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,941
Your brother...

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,979
[tense music playing]

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,583
[young Mikami] I heard it from a friend.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,887
He said, "Your brother's
been acting strange lately."

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,759
[tense music continues]

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,999
[boy] I feel bad
that you have to go through this

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,734
because of me, Takashi.

9
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,875
[indistinct chatter]

10
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,880
Kota! Kota!

11
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,015
Don't look.

12
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,965
Takashi, don't look!

13
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,104
[muted thump]

14
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,945
[emotional piano music playing]

15
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:36,796
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

16
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,699
[Kanzaki] I'm...

17
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,271
I'm okay now.

18
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,911
So next, it's your turn.

19
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,105
LIGHT FIT SANITARY PADS

20
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,686
THE SHOCKING PAST OF THE
BUREAUCRAT-TURNED-TEACHER

21
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,322
INVOLVED IN A SCANDAL OVER
POST-RETIREMENT JOB PLACEMENTS

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,329
[choral music playing]

23
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,299
[Isshiki] During menstruation,
emotions become unstable

24
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,468
so it's not unusual
for various things to happen.

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,839
But you can buy sanitary products
at the school store

26
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,074
and there are some stocked
in the restrooms too.

27
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:59,312
Still, I was concerned because she kept
coming to ask for them every time lately.

28
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,781
[Isshiki] I'm heading to the staff room
for a moment.

29
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,217
If anyone comes,
could you tell them I'll be right back?

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,792
[choral music continues]

31
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,483
[Koreeda]
Could it be that she couldn't afford them?

32
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,220
I think that's a real possibility.

33
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,964
You're frozen like a statue.
Are you okay?

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,367
Sorry, I grew up with a brother...

35
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,203
[Isshiki] As a teacher, you can't avoid
dealing with these issues.

36
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,574
But are those things
really that expensive?

37
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,210
At most, about 500 yen.

38
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,047
Period poverty.

39
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,316
That's what I was thinking.

40
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,486
What's Shiiba-san's home situation?

41
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,990
She lost her parents in a car accident
when she was little.

42
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,726
She's being raised now
by her paternal grandparents

43
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,327
who run a traditional sweets shop.

44
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,797
It wouldn't be surprising
if her home environment

45
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,132
has changed drastically.

46
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,834
[Mikami] That was careless of me.

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,736
I'll arrange a meeting
with her right away.

48
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,704
[knocks on door]

49
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,773
- [Isshiki] Come in.
- [Mizohata] Excuse me.

50
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,410
So this is where you were.

51
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,012
Is something wrong?

52
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,884
What is this about?

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,325
- Isn't this bad?
- Huh?

54
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,661
- [indistinct chatter]
- [grunts]

55
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,629
- [male student] Wait, what?
- [female student] What is this?

56
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,464
- [male student] What is this?
- [male student] I don't know.

57
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,565
THE SHOCKING PAST OF THE
BUREAUCRAT-TURNED-TEACHER

58
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,900
HIS BROTHER COMMITTED SUICIDE
AT KEIRYO ACADEMY 22 YEARS AGO!

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,001
[female student] Is this for real?

60
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,203
[male student] I have no idea.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,972
[footsteps approaching]

62
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,507
[male student] Oh, Okami...

63
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,879
That was over 20 years ago.

64
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,717
But for them to write about it...

65
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,119
That kind of gossip article
isn't worth taking seriously.

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,323
[school bell chimes]

67
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,857
Can we start class?

68
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,861
[school bell chimes]

69
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,974
[Shinonome] How can you stay so calm
when something like that

70
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,409
is written about you?

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,844
This doesn't concern you.

72
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,247
I can't forgive this.

73
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:52,952
Because...

74
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,621
it does concern us.

75
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,829
Okay, let's pick up
from where we left off yesterday.

76
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,365
Page 181.

77
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,101
[melancholy music]

78
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,923
[Hayato] Do you think it's true?

79
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,960
What is it with bureaucrats?

80
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,430
The spotlight only shines on us
at times like this.

81
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,632
That's so true.

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,201
You can really feel
the public's desire

83
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,737
to see powerful people fall.

84
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,974
It's a job that gets criticized
but never praised.

85
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,709
That's what being a bureaucrat is.

86
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,210
No wonder fewer people want to do it.

87
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,448
The key phrase in the curriculum
guidelines is "zest for life."

88
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,318
But teacher turnover
and student suicides are both increasing.

89
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:04,524
That key phrase
has become a bad joke.

90
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,294
It's no wonder we're being criticized.

91
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,966
[Mikami] Are you feeling okay?

92
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:23,409
Why do I have to have a male teacher
ask me about menstruation?

93
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,315
Even with my female friends...

94
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,187
it's hard to talk about that stuff.
Do you understand that?

95
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
Yeah, that's...

96
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,428
You're the very one
who hides everything about yourself.

97
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,965
Huh?

98
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,869
Telling others to open up
when you won't is violence.

99
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,513
[keys rattle, lock clicks]

100
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,815
Ouch!

101
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,385
Let's have a showdown.

102
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,654
[arcade noises]

103
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,457
[video game in English] Round one. Fight!

104
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,599
[in Japanese] Tazune was crying
the whole time during class.

105
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,767
Did you notice?

106
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,970
Is that why you called me out?

107
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,106
Yeah. Brace yourself,
because you're going to get an earful.

108
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,211
Do you know why she was crying?

109
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,216
[Tominaga] Ah, come on!

110
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,253
[grunts]

111
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,589
[video game chatter]

112
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,358
[video game in English] Round two.

113
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,692
[Mikami in Japanese] As expected.

114
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,497
[Tominaga] Think.

115
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,967
Think with your own head.

116
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,969
[Mikami] Well, this is sudden.

117
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,071
That's fine. You're not wrong.

118
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,775
What's the problem?

119
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,846
If it's between teacher and student,
this is the perfect answer.

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,017
But what about between two people?

121
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,154
We're completely bare.

122
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,958
If we're dressed in layers,
we won't be able to answer

123
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
the tough questions you throw at us.

124
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,963
Everyone's fighting unarmed,
completely exposed.

125
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,499
Do you realize that?

126
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,037
So...

127
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,509
why are you the only one
wearing a suit of armor?

128
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,147
[quirky music playing]

129
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,416
Well said.

130
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,288
I'm just built different here.

131
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,391
Everyone knows.

132
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,328
After reading that article

133
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,065
we all know what you meant
when you told us to think.

134
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,101
There isn't single person
who doesn't get it.

135
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,872
Yet you tell us
it has nothing to do with us.

136
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,976
You're still in your armor, acting cool.
It makes no sense.

137
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,144
Face it properly.

138
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,752
Maybe it's you who still
can't think of it as something...

139
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,556
from 20 years ago.

140
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,431
[video game buttons clicking]

141
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,568
This is a problem.

142
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,503
[Nakaoka] If something like this
happens again, Kodai will...

143
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,604
[Tsukada] Exactly.

144
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,375
Just when the Yuzuru Mayama
case was finally dying down.

145
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,578
What's the actual situation with Kodai?

146
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,279
Well, that's...

147
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,583
Don't tell me he is declining
the matter concerning

148
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,718
the Chief Cabinet Secretary
Azuma's grandchild...

149
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,154
- No way!
- [both laugh]

150
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,358
Well, yes.
You are actually exactly right.

151
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,128
He says with the media
swarming around the school

152
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,696
there's no way he can proceed.

153
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,097
Well, that's a problem.

154
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,701
Are you okay with making Mr. Azuma angry?

155
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,538
Next year's subsidy could be in jeopardy.

156
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,907
That's definitely a problem.

157
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,375
[Mizohata] Right?

158
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,612
None of the three of us here
will benefit from this.

159
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,920
Understood.
I'll try to convince him somehow.

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,321
[laughs]

161
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,589
- Here.
- Ah...

162
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,824
Here you go.

163
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,741
[choral music playing]

164
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,814
[Kota] Dinosaurs...

165
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,417
Because their brains
were small for their body size

166
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,554
they say when they got
their tails stepped on

167
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,858
it took them about ten minutes
before they'd go, "Argh!"

168
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,694
[laughs]

169
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,965
Isn't that just like Japan right now?

170
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,075
[Mikami] But the academic theory
has changed, you know.

171
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,979
Turns out they could move pretty fast...

172
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,281
Kota.

173
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,197
Leave the Kodai matter to me.

174
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,266
That's reassuring.

175
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,168
- Well then, shall we?
- Do you know a good place?

176
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,270
Yes, actually, I have
a place I'm close with...

177
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,205
[camera shutter clicks]

00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,241
WE SINCERELY APOLOGIZE,
BUT WE ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED.

179
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,677
Shiinoha is closed for now.

180
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,714
Do you know the reason?

181
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,318
I heard the owner's dementia has worsened.

182
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,523
Ah, I see. What about his wife?

183
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
Well, that's the thing...

184
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,261
I think it was around summer...

185
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,397
She collapsed.

186
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,101
[P.A. system dings]

187
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,537
[operator] General visiting, second floor.

188
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,741
Number 77, please proceed
to the second-floor tower.

189
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,516
I don't want to be written about.

190
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,252
I kept...

191
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,390
pretending not to see.

192
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,662
Both the inferiority complex
I had toward my father...

193
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,500
and the baseless sense
of superiority I held toward others...

194
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,439
Mr. Mikami saw right through that.

195
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,610
Me...

196
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,715
you too...

197
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,120
we can't go back anymore.

198
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,327
Are you really okay with this?

199
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,638
It's... already too late.

200
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,175
Even if it is...

201
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,012
Even if it's too late...

202
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,683
I have to write it.

203
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:02,868
SONOKO MIKAMI

- [indistinct chatter]
- [footsteps]

205
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,284
[Isshiki] Long time no see.

206
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,425
Kota, who is this?

207
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,260
Huh?

208
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,462
Sorry for calling you
to a place like this.

209
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,198
It's okay.

210
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,401
You come every weekend?

211
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,436
As much as I can.

212
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,872
Kota, who is she?

213
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,442
Do you remember Mayumi Isshiki?

214
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,386
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,459
- Is it always like this?
- What do you mean?

216
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,627
I mean...

217
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,630
She called you Kota.

218
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,934
Shall we talk over there?

219
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,673
Are you okay?

220
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,642
What do you mean?

221
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,212
Does she sometimes recognize you
as you, Takashi?

222
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,450
Not really.

223
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,752
I see.

224
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,555
I've gotten used to it.

225
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,058
You shouldn't get used to it

226
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,761
I don't think so.

227
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,365
But I have no choice.
It's been like this for over 20 years.

228
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,475
Kota was awful, wasn't he?

229
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,877
[laughs] What's the point
of saying that now?

230
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,682
I just visited Sonoko's room.

231
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,350
It looked like a jungle, didn't it?

232
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,987
[Isshiki] Even though it's been 20 years
since he passed away

233
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,024
he still dominates so many hearts

234
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,426
and even makes the news.

235
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,032
I just want to tell him
to stop hogging all the attention.

236
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,533
[chuckling] That kind of talk...

237
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,069
Isn't it the same for you too,
Mayumi?

238
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,006
True.

239
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,612
Kota, you aren't wrong.

240
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,482
Don't just say things to comfort me.

241
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,818
[melancholy music playing]

242
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,862
Still, you are amazing.

243
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,467
The school is starting to stir.

244
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,505
You're the one
who stirred things up, Mayumi.

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,308
[Isshiki] Takashi Mikami?

246
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,050
[Mikami] Even so, you've got a lot of guts

247
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,985
standing in front
of the Ministry of Education

248
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,022
telling me, "Come to our school
to expose the darkness!"

249
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,129
I saw the students who were suffering
and felt I couldn't just stand by.

250
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,069
The Ministry, Rintoku,
and Nagatacho...

251
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,673
there's definitely a connection.

252
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,309
And yet we still can't get
any solid evidence.

253
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,514
But we'll uncover the full truth,
no matter what.

254
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,951
[choral music playing]

255
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,892
And you...

256
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,329
Huh?

257
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,431
You called me here.

258
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,666
That must mean you want
to move forward, right?

259
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,669
[choral music continues]

260
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,392
[Isshiki] If you warm it up a bit,
it'll feel better.

261
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,394
[Shiiba] Thank you.

262
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,366
- [Isshiki] Come. in.
- [Chigira] Excuse me.

263
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,702
[Shiiba] Chigira?

264
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,772
I heard you
weren't feeling well again.

265
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,675
Yeah, I'm okay. Just menstrual cramps.

266
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,443
But it's been going on for a while now.

267
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,012
Yeah.

268
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,250
Sorry, Chigira...
Could you put this on for me?

269
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,586
Of course.

270
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,221
Thank you.

271
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,292
- [cell phone vibrates]
- [Chigira] Where should I stick it?

272
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,095
- [Shiiba] Lower back, please.
- [Chigira] Lower back? Okay.

273
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,430
TAKASHI MIKAMI
I WILL TALK TO THE STUDENTS NOW

274
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,566
- [Chigira] How about here?
- [Shiiba] Yeah. Thanks.

[chatter stops]

277
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,057
[Mikami] I want to talk to you
about my brother.

278
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,863
It was something I should've
shared with you... but I didn't.

279
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,032
I'd like to take a bit of your time.

280
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,884
The cause of death was suicide
as an act of protest against the school.

281
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,456
He was in the broadcasting club
and made an announcement

282
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,057
protesting against the school.

283
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,227
Then he activated a device
he built himself...

284
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,631
and died by electrocution.

285
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,137
What do you think of his actions?

286
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,714
- What was the reason?
- Reason?

287
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,752
The article didn't mention
what he was protesting.

288
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,255
Tsugimoto...

289
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,958
you've been gathering information,
haven't you?

290
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,159
You know, right?

291
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,979
The protest was about...

292
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,715
[clicks]

293
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,360
[Kota] Upon the transition
from middle to high school

294
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,633
the school rejected a student
with developmental disabilities.

295
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,170
[Kota] There was no issue
with their test scores.

296
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,307
It was most likely because the student
was considered difficult to handle.

297
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,909
So they got rid of them.

298
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:29,414
This is a serious human rights issue.

299
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,952
It goes against our school's motto
of creating an equal society.

300
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,524
[Tsugimoto] Kota Mikami started a petition

301
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,061
but at the time,
the term "developmental disability"

302
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,162
wasn't widely understood.

303
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,665
He couldn't gain the support
of his classmates.

304
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,534
He became invisible in his class.

305
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,404
His mental health declined.

306
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,006
And one day

307
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,777
he took an extreme action
no one could have ever imagined.

308
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,316
[Kota] I protest against the school

309
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,218
that created this situation.

310
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,523
I protest the cold indifference
shown toward me...

311
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,695
after I spoke up.

312
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,666
I protest the society...

313
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,837
that created this kind of environment.

314
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,044
With my death...

315
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,649
I...

316
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,685
- [knocking]
- [distant shouting]

317
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,355
[breathes deeply]

318
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,590
[knocking grows louder]

319
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,959
I will complete this protest!

320
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,933
[shattering, electricity crackling]

321
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,053
That's all I know.

322
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,322
It's patchwork of things I found online.

323
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,657
I don't even know if it's true.

324
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,827
It's okay. It matches the facts.

325
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,382
I'll say this first
because I feel responsible.

326
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,221
I understand the reason for this protest.

327
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,523
I don't think he was wrong.

328
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,025
And...

329
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,196
I find it very sad that someone
who could think that deeply chose to die.

330
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,467
We shouldn't dismiss this
as someone else's problem.

331
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,606
[ominous music playing]

332
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,146
[ominous music continues]

333
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,972
[ominous music fades]

334
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,514
Anything else?

335
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:58,356
Did the school provide
emotional support to Kota?

336
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,824
His homeroom teacher was very involved

337
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,793
and even came to our house
to talk with him.

338
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,797
But... he was unable to stop him.

339
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,400
After the teacher came, my mother,
who was overly attached

340
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,101
to my brother, learned of the situation.

341
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,404
She clung to my brother, crying.

342
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,175
[Sonoko] Stop this nonsense
and focus on your studies!

343
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,344
Someone has to do it!

344
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,379
You've done more than enough!

345
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,319
You don't need to sacrifice
your life for kids like that.

346
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:33,158
[Sonoko's sobs]

347
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,861
[sobs echoing]

348
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:43,568
[Tominaga] Okami, what do you think?

349
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,041
If you’re going to pretend that
this is just a topic for us to learn from,

350
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,142
I won’t forgive you.

351
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,493
[Shinonome] Thanks to you, Mr. Mikami

352
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,829
I was able to face
the truth about my father.

353
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,800
Though, all I can do
is lend an ear...

354
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,037
[soft grunts]

355
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:32,317
[ominous music playing]

356
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,033
[ominous music fades]

357
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,768
My brother was everything to me.

358
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,737
All of my values...

359
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,809
were shaped by him.

360
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,846
No, they used to be.

361
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,519
Even the way he viewed society...

362
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,955
I looked up to all of it.

363
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,659
Since I was a kid...

364
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,897
I lived wanting to be like him.

365
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,937
That is, until that day...

366
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,714
The model for my life
suddenly disappeared.

367
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,685
My mother broke down,
and our home collapsed.

368
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,726
After his funeral, I returned to school,
but there was no place for me there.

369
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,298
I couldn't take it
and applied to another high school.

370
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,000
[cello music playing]

371
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,235
I ran away.

372
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:03,875
Still, I didn't shut myself in.
I managed to keep living.

373
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,145
Maybe I'm just naturally numb.

374
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,418
Even that became
a source of inferiority for me.

375
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,891
I kept wondering how someone
as intelligent as my brother

376
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,860
became so warped.

377
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,466
He cared more about people
in weaker positions

378
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,034
than about himself.

379
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,974
And I knew better than anyone
that it wasn't just virtue-signaling.

380
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,680
Because my brother was...

381
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,320
someone who always prioritized my pace,
no matter what.

382
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,161
There's this phrase
"The personal is political."

383
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,430
I think someday
you'll understand, Takashi.

384
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,768
[Mikami] And yet...

385
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,906
I never even tried to understand
how my brother felt...

386
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,076
when I told him...

387
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,449
"My friend told me..."

388
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:24,088
"Your brother's been acting weird lately."

389
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,232
[Kota] I'm sorry for making you
feel that way, Takashi.

390
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,870
[Mikami] It wasn't our mother
who gave my brother his final despair.

391
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,341
It was me.

392
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,947
And now, I understand.

393
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,117
My brother wasn't warped.

394
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,022
The world was.

395
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,998
He just couldn't conform
to the distorted shape of this world.

396
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,138
So he died.

397
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,510
[melancholy music playing]

398
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,220
[Kota] But...

399
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,894
if I didn't do it, I'd stop being myself.

400
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,567
That's true.

401
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,405
[melancholy music continues]

402
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,015
I thought we must never
allow another person

403
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,216
like my brother to die.

404
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,020
To make that happen,
I believed we had to change education.

405
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,722
So l set my sights
on the Ministry of Education.

406
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,760
But what I found there was a massive

407
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,763
thoughtless organization.

408
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,703
Some small cells
were desperately trying to move

409
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,241
but the rigid body refused to budge
no matter what.

410
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,846
Then, someone told me
about his school.

411
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,083
And I knew instantly
it was where I needed to be.

412
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,388
Small cells must...

413
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,427
at least face other small cells.

414
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,170
But I realized I hadn't been
facing anything at all.

415
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,775
While...

416
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,613
all of you were facing it head-on.

417
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,027
From now on,
I will never look away again.

418
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,533
I promise.

419
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,582
[school bell chimes]

420
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,413
All right, shall we eat lunch?

421
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,982
[laughter]

422
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,383
[Tsugimoto] What?

423
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,752
Let's eat. Time for lunch!

424
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,754
[male student] All right, let's go!

425
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,557
[male student] Let's eat. Come on.

426
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,059
[indistinct chatter]

427
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,861
You eating?

428
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:24,962
Let's eat.

429
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,603
[Kanzaki] Okami.

430
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,175
What is it?

431
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,613
I met with Yuzuru the other day.

432
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,349
You saw her?

433
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,789
Yeah. That's all, really

434
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:55,993
How was she?

435
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,030
Same as ever.

436
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:02,133
But...

437
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,836
[string music playing]

438
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,572
...we talked. A little.

439
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,076
I see.

440
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,219
Well then.

441
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,491
[string music continues]

442
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,539
[Tsugimoto] Hey, Lupin.
Load Kota Mikami's profile.

443
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,742
- [computer] Loading...
- Wait, what are you doing?

444
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,411
I was just about to erase
all the related info.

445
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,249
- Erase it?
- Yeah.

446
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,318
As much as I can
from the internet too.

447
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,822
When you look at the internet

448
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,858
you really see how prone humans
are to making mistakes.

449
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,862
Yeah, totally.

450
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,768
The so-called opinions
that float around online

451
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,305
kill so many hearts and lives.

452
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,943
Right. That's the real silent killer.

453
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,613
How long has the internet
been around in Japan?

454
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,950
It's been about 30 years
since regular people like us

455
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,151
could easily access it.

456
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,888
Whoa. And this is how much
presence it has now?

457
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,857
Has the world
been completely taken over?

458
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,525
It's convenient.

459
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:39,163
So convenient that it's hard
to imagine a world without it.

460
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,700
True that.

461
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,906
Hey, before deleting it...

462
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:54,545
Hey, Lupin. Generate a photo
of Kota Mikami at age 39.

463
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,380
[computer] Understood.

464
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,986
[emotional music playing]

465
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,561
What the...

466
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,498
It's just a slightly older Okami!

467
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,135
[quiet chuckle]

468
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,607
[emotional music continues]

469
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,550
- Hey, Lupin.
- [Lupin beeps]

470
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,822
Delete Kota Mikami's profile completely.

471
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,259
[computer] Do you want
to fully delete everything?

472
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,133
[mouse clicks]

473
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,773
All right. All right...

474
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,908
All right!

475
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,280
What's with you, Jigen?

476
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,216
What's with you, Tominaga?

477
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,418
[Tsugimoto sniffles]

478
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,756
I don't need that.

479
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,859
You made the effort to go
all the way to Tokyo

480
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,661
only to say, "I'll ask him"?

481
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,496
What are you, a child running errands?

482
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,732
Well, the budget for next year
is being finalized soon...

483
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,301
So?

484
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,871
You know full well
that Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma

485
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,206
has tremendous
influence over the budget...

486
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,277
You always make
that pathetic face like a needy dog.

487
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,780
That's why they take advantage of you.

488
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,947
Excuse me?

489
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,151
If it turns out this school
is involved in misconduct

490
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,654
what do you think will happen
to the Rintoku brand we've built?

491
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:44,989
Still...

492
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,826
Both Mr. Azuma and Mr. Tsukada
want our brand.

493
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,096
That's what this is about!

494
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:56,200
We have to show them
that it's not so easy

495
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,302
to get what they want.

496
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,206
[suspenseful music playing]

497
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,544
Become someone truly worthy
of Rintoku, Mizobata.

498
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,319
[suspenseful music continues]

499
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,390
[footsteps approaching]

500
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,530
I give you credit for finding me here.

501
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,099
Yuzuru told me.

502
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,435
You were able to meet with her?

503
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,671
Yes.

504
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,775
She wrote the address on an envelope.

505
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,313
Did she read the letter?

506
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,015
Well...

507
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,320
I...

508
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,554
I see.

509
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,093
She's stubborn, isn't she?

510
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,896
Yeah.

511
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,033
She's a lot like you, Ms. Saejima.

512
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,608
Haven't you been able to see her?

513
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,748
It's okay.

514
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,384
Huh?

515
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,122
I'm sure she wants to see you.

516
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,793
No way.

517
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,497
Do people really just develop kindness
like that once they grow up?

518
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,632
Ah, no.

519
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,134
It's a built-in feature.

520
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,903
I just hadn't shown it.

521
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,377
Why did you become a teacher?

522
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,114
I already told you.
I'm no longer a teacher.

523
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,590
But your heart hasn't quit, has it?

524
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,131
Huh?

525
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,902
Because it's a job
where you get to witness

526
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,972
the moment someone changes.

527
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,214
And I...

528
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,885
I took that from you, didn't I?

529
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,928
Mr. Mikami
must be a really good teacher.

530
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,432
If you were to meet him...

531
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,437
you'd surely regret it.

532
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,707
What kind of way is that to put it?

533
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,042
You really like him, don't you?

534
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,154
Please tell me...

535
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,957
the truth.

536
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,462
If I tell you...

537
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,999
I'll stop being even a former teacher.

538
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,671
["Puppets Can't Control You"
by One OK Rock playing]

539
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,022
[bartender] Welcome.

540
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,458
Huh? Isn't Mr. Nakaoka here today?

541
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,327
[bartender] He's not here today.

542
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,964
- That's a shame.
- Right this way.

543
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,811
No going outside!
Come back inside.

544
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,913
[sighs]

545
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,082
- [Makino] One highball, please.
- [bartender] Certainly.

546
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:15,526
[ragged scream]

547
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,697
[Shiiba's grandfather]
Hey, we've got a customer!

548
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:23,567
[breathes heavily]

549
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,119
[sighs deeply]

550
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,989
[Mikami] They've been closed for a while?

551
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,359
[Koreeda] It seems Shiiba-san
is juggling several part-time jobs.

552
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,728
And caregiving
during her spare time.

553
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,499
I wasn't able to get
a good hearing from her.

554
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,803
Still, it's not something we can ignore.

555
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,706
Yes, I agree.

556
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:05,809
We need to take appropriate action.

557
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,218
Being a teacher
really is an important job, isn't it?

558
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,122
Where is this coming from?

559
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,427
After hearing what you said today...

560
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,465
I couldn't help but think...

561
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,369
if you had been there then...

562
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,874
maybe you could have stopped

563
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,176
what happened with your brother.

564
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,449
I don't see it that way.

565
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,620
Still, I thought, just maybe.

566
00:44:58,896 --> 00:44:59,997
No matter what

567
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,467
we have to make sure
Shiiba-san's life can go on.

568
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:08,839
[telephone ringing]

569
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,445
Hello, Rintoku Gakuin.
Mikami speaking.

570
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:17,915
Yes.

571
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,218
What?

572
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,787
[tense music playing]

573
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,361
[Mikami] I'll head over immediately.
Please don't contact the police.

574
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,502
Haruno Shiiba is one of my students.

575
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,709
[Kodai] She's stained
Rintoku's reputation.

576
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,879
I think what she did
warrants as much.

577
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,315
Why not draw him in while we still can?

578
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,016
[man 1] We can bury whatever we like.

579
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,186
If Ms. Saejima's protecting
someone, it has to be a student.

580
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,455
Where exactly
should we direct our protest?

581
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,859
We either bring him over to our side
or we cut him off.

582
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,762
[man 2] It's time to figure out
who to keep.
