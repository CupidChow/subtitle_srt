- [dull thump]

00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,292
- [faint squishing]
- [knees thump]

[body thuds]

00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:45,071
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,250
[man] What exactly is going on here?

12
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,554
Mr. Mikami.

13
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,625
There was a stabbing
at the general employment exam venue.

14
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,893
Was it one of the proctors?

15
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,229
No, it was an examinee.

16
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,765
I see.

17
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,377
Not interested, huh?

18
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,347
Should I be?

19
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,015
You sound aloof.

20
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,950
You're about to work in education,
and you don't care?

21
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,953
Who's aloof now?

22
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,325
Being able to teach at a school

23
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,594
is a dream for a Ministry of Education
official, isn't it?

24
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,896
I'd love to take your place.

25
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,397
No way, not happening.

26
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,833
You don't even have
a teaching license, do you, Makino?

27
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,972
[woman] Mr. Makino,
we received the advance notice

28
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,474
for tomorrow's parliamentary questions.

29
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,775
I'll be right there.

30
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,152
You know... honestly, I'm jealous.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,054
Why?

32
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,956
Because this is the first time
a bureaucrat

33
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,492
is being dispatched
to a private high school.

34
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,360
You're incredible, Mr. Mikami.

35
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,530
- [Mikami] It's a demotion.
- Mm.

36
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,034
A convenient way to exile me.

37
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,340
I was betrayed by a friend I trusted.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,841
- [tape rasps]
- [man] Huh?

39
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,446
Ah. [sighs heavily]

40
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,222
[melancholy string music playing]

41
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,358
[officer] Step back!

42
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:51,164
[Mikami] Is it fate
that the murder happened today?

43
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,102
Reforming education...

44
00:03:56,202 --> 00:04:02,308
Everyone knows it's necessary
to change this rigid society.

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,045
And yet, this place, which is supposed
to be the very heart of it all

46
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,314
is instead making a spectacle
of the incident

47
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,450
getting oddly excited,
like a crowd of onlookers.

48
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,056
No one ever thinks
they'd play a part in such an event

49
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,760
until it actually happens to them.

50
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:29,836
Right now, you alone bear the weight
of this society's distortions.

51
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,772
- [car door closes]
- [police siren wails]

52
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,674
[Mikami] You stand there,
completely alone.

53
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:40,213
[melancholy string music continues]

54
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,052
[door closes]

55
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,857
[Mikami] I will not forsake
that loneliness.

56
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,694
NATIONAL CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINEE
STABBED TO DEATH

57
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,233
[Mikami] You, too, are searching
for a place to return to.

58
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,504
[string music turns hopeful]

59
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,243
[Mikami] The potential sleeping
within all of you guides me.

60
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,913
EXAMINEE STABBING SUSPECT MAYAMA
ARRESTED IN THE ACT

61
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,957
If it means wading through
the mud, I'm ready.

62
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,704
[string music turns triumphant]

63
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:44,377
[female newscaster] The arrested suspect
is an exam taker, Yuzuru Mayama, age 22.

64
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:48,614
He stabbed fellow examinee Shibutani

65
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,352
who had just finished
and was about to leave the venue...

66
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,156
[Mikami] I will not ignore
the voiceless screams within you.

67
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:08,935
You taught me that love and hatred
exist so very close to each other.

68
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,726
[triumphant music playing]

69
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,663
[Mikami] I'm going.

70
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:49,041
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

71
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,012
[sighs]

72
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,563
Starting this term,
I've been assigned to this school.

73
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,098
My name is Takashi Mikami.

74
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,436
I will be your homeroom teacher this year.
Nice to meet you all.

75
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,804
- [student] Huh?
- [indistinct chatter]

76
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,772
[male student] Homeroom teacher?
What's going on?

77
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,277
- [Mikami] Um, I...
- [Sakurai] Excuse me.

78
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,914
Yes, what is it, Sakurai?

79
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,217
- [male student 1] He remembers her name?
- [male student 2] Oh, wow. That's freaky.

80
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,852
Does he already know all of us?

81
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,955
Why isn't Ms. Koreeda
our homeroom teacher?

82
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,759
[Mikami] Ms. Koreeda will be assisting
as the co-homeroom teacher for this class.

83
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,527
Isn't that strange?

84
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,531
Shouldn't our homeroom teacher
be the same as last year?

85
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,899
That's what I heard.

86
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,501
[male student]
I'd like to know the reason.

87
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,603
I wasn't given an explanation.

88
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,373
[female student] So they didn't even
tell you, Ms. Koreeda?

89
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,145
[sighs] I asked,
but they wouldn't tell me.

90
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,581
- [students gasp]
- That's bad.

91
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,750
[students murmuring]

92
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,052
[mouthing]

93
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,223
This is our senior year.
It's a very important year.

94
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,060
Something this irregular is unsettling.

95
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,129
I was dispatched here
from the Ministry of Education.

96
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,399
- [student 1] Huh?
- [student 2] What?

97
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,535
Ministry of Education? [chuckles]

98
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,337
Why is a bureaucrat here?

99
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,806
The Ministry of Education
believes that bureaucrats

100
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,508
should experience
the education field firsthand.

101
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,243
As such, there's a system in place
where young bureaucrats

102
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,477
are dispatched as teachers.

103
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,381
And this year, the program has been
expanded to private high schools

104
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,149
which is why I was assigned here.

105
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,686
But as a homeroom teacher?
That's ridiculous.

106
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,323
Giving a bureaucrat a fitting role...
That's basic protocol.

107
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,960
A student from this school
should at least know that.

108
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,795
The fact that I'm satisfied
being a homeroom teacher

109
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,230
shows how humble I am.

110
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,073
[male student] Can you even teach?

111
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,411
Ah, you're Kanzaki
from the journalism club.

112
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,813
Huh?

113
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,284
[Mikami] "This class has Kanzaki in it."

114
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,553
I was told you're someone
I need to be wary of

115
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,187
and that I should make sure
that I'm not taken for a fool.

116
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,455
Please stop.

117
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,225
[Kanzaki] It's fine.
I don't fall for provocations like that.

118
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,993
The one doing the provoking
is you, Kanzaki.

119
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,497
That's true, since I'm
"someone you need to be wary of."

120
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,237
Then, I might as well take the bait.

121
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,338
Huh?

122
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,440
Looking at the accuracy rate
of last year's final exams

123
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,943
it's clear that question four
was the weakest.

124
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,512
Do you remember question four?

125
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,322
This one. It asks to find
the minimum value

126
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,959
so most people try to solve it
using trigonometric functions.

127
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,730
But actually, this is a geometry problem.

128
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,900
If you draw it out, the answer
immediately becomes obvious.

129
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,010
With this method,
a certain geometric figure emerges.

130
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,247
This means the minimum value is reached
when Point P coincides with Point A.

131
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,552
Once you understand that,
the solution becomes simple.

132
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,291
What's important here
is algebra and geometry.

133
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,460
In other words, math consists
of two intertwined fields

134
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,661
functions and geometry.

135
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,263
People have this strange belief
that they are separate

136
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,966
but clinging to that idea
will make you miss solvable problems.

137
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:38,037
The reason they are studied alternately
is because they are deeply connected.

138
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,672
Don't forget this perspective.

139
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,716
[chalk rasping]

140
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,688
When people my age were in high school

141
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,524
each grade level
had about 1.1 million students.

142
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,862
Meanwhile, the number of people who passed
the national civil service exam was 1,370.

143
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,164
That means about one
in a thousand made it.

144
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,168
And that one person is me.

145
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,872
I have never failed an exam.

146
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,142
Every test I took, I passed at the top.

147
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,243
Do you know why?

148
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,579
Because I knew how to study.

149
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,817
When it comes to entrance exam strategies

150
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,319
there's no teacher
in this school who can beat me.

151
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,161
Do you all think of yourselves as elites?

152
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,466
Rintoku Gakuin has the highest
number of students

153
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,601
admitted to the University of Tokyo
in the prefecture.

154
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,306
Since most of you
aim to go to Tokyo University

155
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,176
it's natural that you
see yourselves as elites.

156
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,647
But do you truly understand
what being elite means?

157
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,753
The word "elite" comes from Latin
and originally meant "chosen by God."

158
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,290
In this country, people believe
that having a high academic background

159
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,293
a prestigious social status,
and a high income

160
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,828
makes someone an elite.

161
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,265
But that's not what being elite is.

162
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,542
That's just being
a future upper-class citizen.

163
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,253
[school bell chiming]

164
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,994
Well then, I look forward
to working with you all this year.

165
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,667
[door opens]

166
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,236
[Koreeda] Mr. Mikami, a moment, please.

167
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,605
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,706
What do you mean?

169
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,609
You were blatantly provoking the students.

170
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,011
- Is that a problem?
- Of course, it's a problem!

171
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,781
Then, Ms. Koreeda,
what do you expect from the students?

172
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:02,882
Huh?

173
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,285
Do you want them to be fearless warriors
who conquer the entrance exam battlefield?

174
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,954
That's not what I meant.

175
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,890
However, entrance exams
don't wait for anyone.

176
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,993
If schools like Rintoku
don't cultivate true elites

177
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,528
this country will collapse.

178
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,935
No matter the reason

179
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,604
calling students
"future upper-class citizens"

180
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,474
- to look down on them is unacceptable.
- [Mikami chuckles]

181
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,075
What's so funny?

182
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,912
Slow loris.

183
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,446
What?

184
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:39,151
They look cute, but they're
the only primates that carry venom.

185
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,922
Even with their tiny bodies,
which weigh just a few pounds

186
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,925
they coat their fur with toxic saliva
and fight off predators.

187
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,626
You remind me of them.

188
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,296
Are you mocking me?

189
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,164
- No, not at all.
- But...

190
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,667
You were suddenly replaced
as the homeroom teacher.

191
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,002
You should fight back.

192
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,639
[man] Mr. Mikami!

193
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,275
Ah, Chairman Kodai!

194
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,848
[Kodai] I'll consider it,
so let's talk again later.

195
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,183
- [male student] Promise?
- [Kodai] Sure, I got it.

196
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,653
- Thank you, Chairman!
- Chairman, thank you!

197
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,788
[Kodai chuckles]

198
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,458
They want to start
a "Hyakunin Isshu" club.

199
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,461
How nice. It's good to learn
about traditional culture.

200
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,897
So, they come directly
to the chairman, don't they?

201
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,736
I want Rintoku to be a school
with open communication.

202
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,837
[chuckles]

203
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,640
I try to speak with the students
as much as possible.

204
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,410
Because of that,
they come to me for everything.

205
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,880
But getting students
to reveal their true thoughts

206
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,281
isn't easy nowadays, is it?

207
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:47,019
That's right.
So, to make myself approachable

208
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,388
I casually wander around the school.

209
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,790
[female student] Chairman Kodai!

210
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,127
[laughs] See?

211
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,899
If there's anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

212
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,567
- Thank you.
- Well then.

213
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,668
See you.

214
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,173
- What's going on?
- [female student] Hello.

215
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,109
We're thinking of establishing
an e-sports club

216
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,210
under the student council.

217
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,978
[Kodai] E-sports?

218
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,248
There's something I want to ask.

219
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,518
It's about Takuto Kanzaki.

220
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,121
[Mikami] Is it true
that he exposed a teacher's affair

221
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,258
published it in the school newspaper,
and forced them to resign?

222
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,227
[Koreeda] You mean the Rintoku Newspaper?

223
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,262
It's true.

224
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,630
[Mikami] You knew about it, didn't you?

225
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,768
The teacher who resigned...
Ms. Saejima, I believe?

226
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,703
The one from the other day...

227
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,774
- Wait, you know about it?
- Yes.

228
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,213
[string music swells]

229
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,503
[indistinct chatter]

230
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,907
Things are getting interesting, huh?

231
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,243
What part of this is interesting?

232
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,379
Seeing you make that face.

233
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,183
[indistinct chatter]

234
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,385
- What do you think?
- About what?

235
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,989
- Isn't this bad?
- [chuckles]

236
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,291
His lesson was great, but...

237
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,693
being forced into submission like that
doesn't sit well with me.

238
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,263
Calling us "future upper-class citizens"
was a bit too much.

239
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,365
Seriously.

240
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,200
Well, he's the definition of a bureaucrat.

241
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,068
[grumpy student] He's so irritating.

242
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,870
I actually think he's fine.

243
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,638
[male student] What? How?

244
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,875
He didn't say anything that was incorrect.

245
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,076
[male student] Yeah, but still.

246
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,811
- Let's drop it.
- Huh?

247
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,747
Why?

248
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,750
If we start getting flustered,
we're playing right into his hands.

249
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,455
[male student 1]
Chigira, ask your dad to step in.

250
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
Huh?

251
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,861
[grumpy student] Oh, right! The only way
to beat a bureaucrat is with a politician.

252
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,163
- [male student 1] Exactly.
- [male student 3] Shut up already.

253
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,565
[female student]
Hey, what do you think, Fuyuki?

254
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,568
- Yeah, I'm curious, too.
- Just ignore the guy.

255
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,139
[Fuyuki] Just focus on submitting
your assignments properly.

256
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,842
So, everything okay?

257
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,278
Ah, Mr. Mizohata. How can I help you?

258
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,181
I want to talk about Ms. Koreeda.

259
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,949
What about her?

260
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,019
She's passionate.

261
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,689
But sometimes, just sometimes...

262
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,992
she goes too far.

263
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,527
In what way?

264
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,029
Oh. Pardon me.

265
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,769
Well, she insists on making
the exams by herself.

266
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,540
[chuckles] Right now, it's standard
for all subject teachers

267
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,975
to collaborate on creating tests.

268
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,110
So Rintoku is the same way?

269
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,047
Yes. A little personal touch
is fine, but...

270
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,817
Creating an entirely
original exam is a problem?

271
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,755
She's stubborn about it
and won't change, which is frustrating.

272
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,926
This is just between you and me, but
she comes from a distinguished family.

273
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:18,864
[Mizohata] Her parents
donated a significant sum

274
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,499
when Chairman Kodai founded Rintoku.

275
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,702
Even now, they continue
to support the school.

276
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,339
That's how she got hired here.

277
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,741
Basically, she's a nepotism hire.

278
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,478
So we can't push back on her too hard.

279
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,879
Honestly, I'm at a loss.

280
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,785
I was actually relieved
when you took over as homeroom teacher.

281
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,620
[laughs]

282
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,356
- [Mikami] It was a good exam, though.
- Huh?

283
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,493
I tried solving last year's
final exam questions.

284
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,996
- The one she made?
- Yes.

285
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,967
University entrance exams these days
test a student's ability

286
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,803
to think, reason, and express themselves.

287
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,006
Even the math questions
are needlessly long.

288
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,107
Good morning.

289
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,176
[Mikami] Some are even formatted
like short stories for no reason.

290
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,447
Ms. Koreeda's long comprehension problems
are based on that trend.

291
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,850
I think they're excellent
for testing fundamental understanding.

292
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,686
What do you think, Mr. Mizohata?

293
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,857
Well, if you put it that way...

294
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,528
Wait, don't tell me.
You haven't taken it, have you?

295
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,698
I haven't. I didn't need to.

296
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,101
Oh. [chuckles] This part in particular...

297
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,203
"Summarize from the reverse perspective."

298
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,105
Things are getting tense from day one.

299
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,973
Stop, they can hear us!

300
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,141
Did you know?

301
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,212
[Yamazoe] Mr. Mizohata failed the civil
service exam and wound up being a teacher.

302
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,713
[Yoshikawa] Huh? Really?

303
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,416
[Yamazoe] Male jealousy
sure is terrifying, isn't it?

304
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,554
...her problem really does test
deep comprehension skills.

305
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,793
You are truly impressive. [chuckles]

306
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,328
Your mindset
is on a different level from ours.

307
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,429
[both laugh]

308
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,766
Bureaucrats have to be able
to recall data instantly.

309
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,468
If not, they're called incompetent.
It's a sad job.

310
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,404
It's just a habit ingrained in me.

311
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,708
Keep stimulating the students like this.

312
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,109
[both laugh]

313
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
- [school bell chimes]
- Oh.

314
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,713
It's time for your first class.

315
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,783
[laughs] Don't make me more nervous.

316
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,620
All right, here I go.

317
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:29,194
[school bell chiming]

318
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,964
NURSE'S OFFICE
PLEASE KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING

319
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,032
Just because it's the first day
of a new semester

320
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,168
you don't have to push yourself, Shiiba.

321
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,204
If it's too much, just leave early.

322
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,475
I'll be fine after a short rest.

323
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,578
You're such a hard worker.

324
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,389
[retreating footsteps]

325
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,130
- [Koreeda] See you tomorrow.
- [student] Thank you.

326
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,231
Good work.

327
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,334
- [Enomoto] Ms. Koreeda.
- Hm?

328
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,903
[Enomoto] Is there really no way for you
to come back as our homeroom teacher?

329
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,706
I'm happy you feel that way,
but it's probably impossible.

330
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,477
That bureaucrat teacher feels like an AI.

331
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,512
- He is creepy, isn't he?
- Yeah.

332
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,950
This is what an AI teacher is like, right?

333
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,852
- Huh?
- What?

334
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,254
[keyboard keys clack]

335
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,325
[all laugh]

336
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,926
He's kind of cute when he smiles.

337
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,662
Isn't this a bit creepy?

338
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,830
I hereby name him "Okami."

339
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,766
- Huh?
- What? Okami?

340
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,436
I mean, isn't it actually harder
to read his name?

341
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,406
O-ka-mi.

342
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,608
[all laugh]

343
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,009
You're right!

344
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,613
An elite bureaucrat
with that name feels like a joke.

345
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,616
I thought the same thing. Nice one, Jigen!

346
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,252
- Right?
- [approving chatter]

347
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,989
Apparently, he already has data
on everyone in the class.

348
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,557
- Huh?
- Data?

349
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,093
Grades, desired universities,
family backgrounds...

350
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,095
That's scary.

351
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,998
Well, he is a bureaucrat.
So, he'd do something like that.

352
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,666
But still, isn't that unsettling?

353
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,272
That's unusual.
Kanzaki seems really annoyed.

354
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,240
- [laughs]
- Isn't that good, though?

355
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,243
Even the undefeated king needs a rival.

356
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,346
- Woo!
- [students laugh]

357
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,581
[Tsugimoto] Even though AI is advancing,
teaching is still considered

358
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,551
one of the seven jobs
that won't disappear.

359
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:37,222
But in Okami's case,
he is the human who's turning into AI.

360
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,929
Sorry.

361
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,567
[uneasy music playing]

362
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,979
[door closes]

363
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,451
[tense music playing]

364
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,259
What the hell?

365
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395
[chuckles]

366
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,496
What?

367
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,365
- Hello.
- Hello.

368
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,739
It's about Mr. Mikami.

369
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,441
What about him?

370
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,777
He seems different from what I was told.

371
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,645
What do you mean?

372
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,547
Like he's hiding something.

373
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,883
And there's a troublesome aura about him.

374
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,085
He seemed like a bright
and cheerful young man, though.

375
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:44,489
Really? He was completely different
when I met him.

376
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,926
Maybe it's just because
you're in battle mode, Mr. Mizobata?

377
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,961
- Huh?
- [laughs]

378
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,930
It's "Mizohata."

379
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,666
Rintoku accepted a bureaucrat dispatch

380
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:59,738
so we could receive favors
from the Ministry of Education.

381
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,543
If this backfires,
that would be a problem.

382
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,312
That's true. You are exactly right, sir.

383
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,314
Then, Principal Katagiri,
please do something about it.

384
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,949
Well... [clears throat]

385
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,284
When a bureaucrat comes in

386
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,086
you have to give them
at least a vice-principal role.

387
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,390
But Mr. Mikami humbly said

388
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,393
he wanted to face
the students as a teacher.

389
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,663
At the very least,
making him a homeroom teacher

390
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,631
was necessary to save face
with the Ministry.

391
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,200
I understand that, but...

392
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,135
If you want people to accept you

393
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,371
you need to make an effort first,
Mr. Mizobata.

394
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,142
It's "Mizohata."

395
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,678
What?

396
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,249
Kanzaki, are you planning
to put Okami in his place?

397
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,552
- Don't you think it's odd, Tominaga?
- What is?

398
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,888
The fact that our homeroom teacher
was changed.

399
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,825
Hmm. It's like those detective dramas

400
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:58,330
where the veteran detectives get bossed
around by some young elite recruit.

401
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,832
You know, adult politics.

402
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,368
And you're okay with that?

403
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,771
Not really, but...

404
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,106
Not really, but?

405
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,278
I don't know.
Okami seems kind of interesting.

406
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,647
Huh?

407
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,883
Based on what?

408
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,119
[chuckles] Just a hunch.

409
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,457
That makes no sense.

410
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,008
[Mikami] You were suddenly replaced
as the homeroom teacher.

411
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,210
You should fight back.

412
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,379
[sighs]

413
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,719
- [beeps]
- [gate whirs, clanks]

414
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,491
[soft music playing]

415
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,344
[man] There's this phrase,
"The personal is political."

416
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,713
Personal? What's that?

417
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,850
It means personal struggles
are political issues.

418
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,552
What does that mean?

419
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,787
There's a phrase like that.

420
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,057
What does that mean?

421
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,563
People's difficulties are often treated
as personal problems.

422
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,865
But in reality, they're societal issues.

423
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,802
In other words, they're problems
that politics should be solving.

424
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,972
Does that explanation make sense?

425
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,675
Hmm...

426
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,111
I get the meaning, but...

427
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,814
Yeah. It's probably still a bit hard
for you to fully understand, Takashi.

428
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,819
But it's a phrase I value a lot.

429
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,755
Mm.

430
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,858
Someday, you'll understand too.

431
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,029
Yeah.

432
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,267
[light music playing]

433
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,558
[Tsukada] Makino-kun, from now on

434
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,994
there are a lot of things
I'd like to ask of you.

435
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,431
A lot, huh? That sounds a bit scary.

436
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,468
What are you saying?
You were expecting this, weren't you?

437
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,569
[chuckles]

438
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,971
Of course.
I'll do anything you need me to.

439
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:31,309
Good. So, have you been
in touch with Mikami?

440
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,012
No, I haven't.

441
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,647
Oh? Is that so?

442
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:39,984
Yes. Apparently, he told Tsubuki
that I betrayed him

443
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,588
and sold him out to you
to get him demoted.

444
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,024
Well, I never intended for it
to be a demotion.

445
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:51,830
[Tsukada] That said, when you suggested
Mikami as the first bureaucrat

446
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,132
to be dispatched to a private school

447
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,368
I almost whistled
at how great an idea it was.

448
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,937
[whistles, chuckles]

449
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,973
[Makino] It's quite convenient
for cooling down the suspicion

450
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,875
over the "amakudari"
brokering scandal, isn't it?

451
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,178
Exactly. That's what I need
you two to make up.

452
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,781
If my subordinates are at odds

453
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,017
it reflects poorly
on my management skills.

454
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,453
Oh?

455
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,690
Are you actually concerned
about how Mikami feels?

456
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,292
Huh? What?

457
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:25,663
Mr. Tsukada, I thought you chose me.

458
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,102
[chuckles] What are you saying?
You're both my valuable subordinates.

459
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,838
I never even thought
about choosing one over the other.

460
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,275
Thank you very much. Excuse me.

461
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,443
[Tsukada] Yeah.

462
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,313
[sighs]

463
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,151
[uneasy music playing]

464
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,222
DINOSAURS

465
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,096
[clanks]

466
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,635
[light music playing]

467
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,691
As an explanation for
"The Era Without Gods"

468
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,294
people became unable
to fully believe in the existence of gods.

469
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,963
They lost their religious
moral consciousness.

470
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,668
Adding such statements
makes the answer more complete.

471
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,112
[clears throat]

472
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:54,619
As exams approach, it's easy to rely
on convenient techniques.

473
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,023
But that's exactly why
you should be engaging with good texts.

474
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,493
Simply picking out words
like "however" and "by the way"

475
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,195
is just a technique.

476
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,966
True reading comprehension
comes from understanding

477
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,934
the fundamental meaning of words.

478
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,105
Now we'll move on to an essay question

479
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,207
from the 2003 University of Tokyo
entrance exam.

480
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,445
The passage you just read
is closely related to this topic.

481
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,913
[male student] Why did Okami come in?

482
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,749
Apparently, he's been going around
observing classes.

483
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,352
Yeah, I saw that mentioned
in my club's group chat.

484
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,555
He just randomly shows up,
regardless of grade level or class.

485
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,357
Oh. How unsettling.

486
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,225
Could he be a spy
from the Ministry of Education?

487
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,227
Honestly, that's a real possibility.

488
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,698
Rintoku probably accepted him
to get grants and other benefits

489
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,001
from the government.

490
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,103
But it seems like it's backfiring on them.

491
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,371
Is that what happened?

492
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,107
Hey, Kanzaki, what do you think?

493
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,044
Don't know, don't care.

494
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,879
Kanzaki, are you leaving already?

495
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:55,980
The school prep course is still going on.

496
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,082
I get enough from regular classes.
Tokyo University is no big deal.

497
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,451
Oh, excuse me!
Unlike you, some of us are attending

498
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,221
both school prep and cram school
and still not making the rankings.

499
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,989
That's not my fault, is it?

500
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,724
Huh?

501
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:07,992
Wow.

502
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,861
He went there.

503
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,197
[student] Bad timing, huh?

504
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,136
Mr. Mikami, can we talk for a moment?

505
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:27,245
[light music playing]

506
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,461
[light music continues]

507
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,414
[door opens]

508
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,016
Mr. Mikami.

509
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,119
If you're going to show up,
at least give me a heads-up.

510
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,420
Was it a problem?

511
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,756
Did Mr. Mizohata tell you
to keep an eye on me?

512
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,925
No, I just wanted to observe.

513
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,561
- That's quite sarcastic.
- Sarcastic? Why?

514
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,329
Because...

515
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,832
Is this how things work now?

516
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,000
What do you mean?

517
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,336
Students grading their teachers.

518
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,706
[Koreeda] It even affects
our performance reviews.

519
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,576
Teachers get salaries, so it makes sense.

520
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,747
[Mikami] You are rated
overwhelmingly high, Ms. Koreeda.

521
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,250
Yes, because I work incredibly hard.

522
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,425
- Ah, a honey badger.
- You know what this is?

523
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,328
It's said to be the world's
most fearless animal

524
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,663
so aggressive that it even
steals food from lions.

525
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,434
Are you saying that I'm a honey badger

526
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,037
and the food I stole
was the homeroom teacher's position?

527
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,838
Yes, that's right.

528
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,008
So is this you fighting back?

529
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,078
Huh?

530
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,815
- I'm not your enemy.
- I know that.

531
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,284
Then maybe you should take
a lesson from the slow loris.

532
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,320
I don't understand what you mean.

533
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:22,226
Even a weak creature can win
if it knows how to fight.

534
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,099
[approaching footsteps]

535
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,734
Ms. Isshiki?

536
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,540
Oh, could this be...

537
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,042
Yes, this is Mr. Mikami.
He has been sent to this school

538
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,445
as a bureaucrat
from the Ministry of Education.

539
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,615
- I'm Isshiki, the school nurse.
- Nice to meet you.

540
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,018
Seniors tend to be emotionally unstable.

541
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,686
Let's work closely together.

542
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,488
Yes, looking forward to it.

543
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,423
Now if you'll excuse me.

544
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,670
Shall we have some tea?

545
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,939
[chuckles] Yes, please.

546
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,611
THIS YEAR'S FACULTY ASSIGNMENTS

547
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,912
CLASS 2
HOMEROOM TEACHER TAKASHI MIKAMI

548
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,314
ASSISTANT HOMEROOM TEACHER
FUMIKA KOREEDA

549
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,917
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

550
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,853
[chuckles] What is that?

551
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,826
- Do I look like this?
- Huh?

552
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,896
I do, don't I?

553
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,365
No, you don't. But...

554
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,901
What's going on with you?

555
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,972
He showed me this picture
and said that's what I look like.

556
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,941
Then he told me to stand up and fight
after I was unfairly demoted

557
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,243
from my position as homeroom teacher.

558
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,046
[Koreeda] His coming here
is the reason I got replaced

559
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,482
so how can he even say that?

560
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,018
And he keeps provoking the students too.

561
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,688
It's rare to see you get this worked up.

562
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,395
I'm frustrated.

563
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,467
I finally got to be
a homeroom teacher in my fifth year.

564
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,438
I wanted to see them through
to graduation.

565
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,142
I completely understand that.

566
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,381
Honestly, I don't know.

567
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,720
Is he an enemy or an ally?

568
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:32,924
[mouse clicks]

569
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,528
[sighs]

570
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:41,299
How is that going?
Anybody came to your counseling room?

571
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,135
[chuckles] Quite a few, actually.

572
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:49,140
Even at a school
full of rich kids like ours

573
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,377
there are plenty of students
with complicated family situations.

574
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,282
Some tie their self-worth
to their test scores.

575
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,420
Some are crushed under their parents'
overwhelming expectations.

576
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:07,158
But they all try so hard.

577
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,929
All I can do is listen to them,
and that frustrates me.

578
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,966
So, it's because of this...
[continues indistinctly]

579
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,469
[Isshiki] Yet, the Fundamental
Law of Education starts with

580
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,373
"Education must aim to cultivate citizens

581
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,675
who are mentally and physically healthy."

582
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,448
Completely unfazed by the changes
in the past 80 years

583
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,783
with no consideration given
to issues like declining birth rates

584
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,318
or the pressures of entrance exams

585
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,221
a robust educational curriculum
has been established.

586
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,691
Three years in an environment
where showing any weakness...

587
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,826
TRADITIONAL CONFECTIONERY
SHIINOHA

588
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,162
...whether in grades
or family background, means losing.

589
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,299
Of course, their mental health suffers.

590
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,768
It's no surprise.

591
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,306
APRIL 10 IS TEXTBOOK DAY

592
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,842
Even if you don't understand Mr. Mikami...

593
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,412
perhaps you can at least believe
in the word "fight."

594
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,719
[indistinct chatter]

595
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,492
[tense music playing]

596
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,529
[clears throat]

597
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,066
Hey, can I ask you something?

598
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,603
It's about that new teacher, Mr. Mikami.

599
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,571
[indistinct chatter]

600
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,073
What would you like?

601
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,342
Thank you for waiting.

602
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,576
[Mikami] Thank you.

603
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,012
Long time no see, Mikami.

604
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,481
I'm not in Kasumigaseki anymore.

605
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,716
What? You got transferred?

606
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,017
It's not exactly a transfer.

607
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,019
It's more like a bureaucratic dispatch.

608
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,621
I'm teaching at a high school.

609
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,456
Really?

610
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,625
The Ministry of Education
sure does some interesting things.

611
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,759
Yeah, I guess.

612
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,728
[customer] Hello!

613
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,862
Welcome.

614
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,732
[Makino] Hey, Mikami.

615
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,202
What are you doing here?

616
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,706
[Mikami] I had some business in the city.

617
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,809
Dinner? Or a late lunch?

618
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,178
Late lunch, unfortunately.

619
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:11,315
Why don't you join us? Can we get a table?

620
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,516
[woman] Of course.

621
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,054
[chuckles]

622
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,426
[dish sizzles]

623
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,661
So, how's school?

624
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,698
It hasn't even been a week yet.

625
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,067
Teaching still feels like playing pretend.

626
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,871
Oh, you're already teaching?
Makes sense, I guess.

627
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,506
Yeah.

628
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,976
Good thing my subject is math.

629
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,278
[Tsubuki] Does that matter?

630
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,348
It's a super elite school, with lots
of kids who came back from abroad.

631
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,717
If I were teaching English,
there'd probably be students

632
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,753
who are better at it than the teachers.

633
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,488
That sounds terrifying.

634
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,990
No matter how smart they are,
I bet you are smarter, Mikami.

635
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:54,658
I wonder.

636
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,364
Rintoku has been the top school
in the prefecture for years, right?

637
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,900
In terms of students
getting into Tokyo University, that is.

638
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,001
Yeah.

639
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,437
It's only been around for 20 years or so.

640
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,706
That's pretty remarkable.

641
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,410
Yeah, the founder, Mr. Kodai,
has been praised

642
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,913
as a charismatic chairman.
He's been on TV a lot lately.

643
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,782
But there's a reason for it.

644
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,450
A reason?

645
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,953
After school, the school itself
runs prep courses.

646
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:24,622
They call it an "on-campus cram school."

647
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,793
[Tsubuki] Oh, I've heard of those.
They've become more common lately.

648
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,729
The school buys lectures from cram schools

649
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,399
so students can take prep courses
without leaving campus.

650
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,936
[Mikami] Rintoku actually started
as a cram school

651
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,272
called "Rintoku Seminar."
They provide full support

652
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,340
so it's way more extensive
than other schools.

653
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,276
Now is the time!

654
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,678
That's why it's so popular now.

655
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,747
No wonder Rintoku is so competitive.

656
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,584
Look, enough about that.

657
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,121
Instead of talking about a school
that buys its way into Tokyo University

658
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,290
shouldn't you be focusing
on something more interesting?

659
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,825
What?

660
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,095
Is that really what you think about
the school you were assigned to?

661
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,803
- [Mikami] Thanks for the meal.
- Are you leaving already?

662
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,138
I got it.

663
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,573
We're celebrating your new position.

664
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,708
Huh?

665
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,944
You got that post
by selling me out, didn't you?

666
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,445
So I should congratulate you.

667
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,348
- [woman] It's 4,500 yen.
- [Mikami] Here you go.

668
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,718
- See you.
- Thank you.

669
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,656
He's got a bad attitude.

670
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,594
Was he always like that?

671
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,697
Well, he was never
the super friendly type.

672
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,032
Considering how much he wanted
to see things on the ground

673
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,268
he should be grateful, if anything.

674
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,372
Um...

675
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,573
Yeah, what?

676
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,644
You weren't the one
who reported Mr. Mikami, were you?

677
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:01,352
And if I was, would there be a problem?

678
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,687
Well...

679
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:04,822
[laughs]

680
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,290
I'm kidding.

681
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,959
But with that attitude,
even the mild-mannered Mr. Makino

682
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,394
would get irritated.

683
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,764
Come on. Don't scare me like that!

684
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,969
[melancholy music playing]

685
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,449
I'm home.

686
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,785
Hi, Fumika. Have you eaten?

687
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,920
Yes, I have.

688
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,289
If you're eating out, let us know.

689
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,491
That's common sense.

690
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,592
Yes.

691
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,927
[Mr. Koreeda] It's fine.

692
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,330
As someone in a teaching position

693
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,465
you need to conduct yourself accordingly.

694
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,270
I apologize.

695
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:06,116
[melancholy music continues]

696
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,790
[sighs heavily]

697
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,667
[buttons clacking]

698
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,279
- [coins clink]
- [video game music plays]

699
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,147
Hm?

700
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,318
Shall we?

701
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,253
[knuckles crack]

702
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,957
[video game music plays]

703
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,559
[video game announcer] Round one, fight!

704
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:52,863
[game character grunts]

705
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,032
[buttons clacking rapidly]

706
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,434
[video game music playing]

707
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,407
[game character grunts, groans]

708
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,610
[video game announcer] You win! Perfect!

709
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,045
All right!

710
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,449
Huh?

711
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,153
Do you come here often?

712
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,023
Wait, were you following me?

713
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,290
No, of course not.

714
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,794
Since we're here, can we talk for a bit?

715
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,198
Buy me a crepe.

716
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,376
[keyboard keys clacking]

717
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,415
- [Mikami] Here you go.
- Thank you.

718
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,417
- No problem.
- Let's eat!

719
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,520
Mm.

720
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,822
Mmm.

721
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,557
[Mikami] Do you play games every day?

722
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,292
Is that bad?

723
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,194
[chuckles] No, I didn't say that.

724
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,131
It's not like I don't have
a place at home

725
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,733
so you needn't worry.

726
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,570
For me, this is just
to shift gears up here.

727
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,140
Fighting games stimulate
the brain, you know?

728
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,342
- Especially when played face-to-face.
- Mm.

729
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:17,548
But right now, Okami, you're not
stimulating my brain cells at all.

730
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,649
Wait, Okami?

731
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,117
Your nickname.

732
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,352
If you're a bureaucrat with a name
like Mikami, it's bound to happen.

733
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,688
Everyone calls you that behind your back.

734
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,327
[chuckles] Okami, huh? Really?

735
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,598
Ah. Makes sense.

736
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,502
So, is this about Kanzaki?

737
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,639
- You two were childhood friends, right?
- Yeah.

738
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,843
But that doesn't mean
I have anything to say about him.

739
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,813
You probably already have
more data on him than I do.

740
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,117
Was he always like that?

741
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:56,019
No way. If there was a kid
like that, it'd be terrifying.

742
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,190
So there was a time when he was innocent?

743
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:04,261
No, I don't think I ever saw
an innocent side to Kanzaki.

744
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:06,730
So he acted like an adult?

745
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,766
Not quite that either.

746
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,970
He was good at wearing
the mask of an adult?

747
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,506
Wow, that's a stylishly perfect answer.

748
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,677
[Mikami] You're worried about him,
aren't you, Tominaga?

749
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,679
[Tominaga]
Well, we were childhood friends.

750
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,483
Kanzaki doesn't really understand himself

751
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,019
so it's nerve-wracking to watch him.
He's always acting tough.

752
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,190
Care for a rematch?

753
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,027
Sure. But you'll have
to step up your game.

754
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,730
If you don't, it won't be worth it for me.

755
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,831
Got it.

756
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,802
Thanks for this.

757
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,344
[foreboding music playing]

758
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,122
[indistinct chatter]

759
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,997
- Good morning.
- Morning.

760
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,270
[female student] Wait. He's a criminal?

761
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:25,075
[tense music playing]

762
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,215
- Mr. Mikami!
- Yes?

763
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:32,816
[Koreeda] Come with me.

764
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,453
Is this true?

765
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,526
Please explain what this is about.

766
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,862
- I'll explain in the classroom.
- Huh?

767
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,700
- No way!
- Seriously?

768
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,436
- That's nuts!
- [indistinct chatter]

769
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,537
Look at this!

770
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,208
I knew it.

771
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,043
It was only a matter of time.

772
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:01,144
What's going on?

773
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:10,587
RINTOKU NEWSPAPER
MR. MIKAMI IS A CRIMINAL!

774
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,191
THE DARKNESS WITHIN
THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

775
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,666
[male student] Hey, Okami is coming!

776
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,870
[tense music playing]

777
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,945
Good morning.

778
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,348
I'll get straight to the point.

779
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,952
This article is mostly true.

780
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,855
- What?
- [students murmuring]

781
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:49,826
Are you aware of the news from last year
about illicit retiree placements

782
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,030
from the Ministry of Education
to a private research institution?

783
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,434
It didn't lead to criminal charges
due to lack of evidence

784
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,237
but someone in the ministry leaked

785
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,306
that I was the one
brokering those placements.

786
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,242
So, it was decided
that I'd be placed at this school

787
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,744
through the bureaucratic dispatch system
until the situation settles down.

788
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,985
The person who wrote this article...
was you, Kanzaki.

789
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,589
Is there anyone else
who could have dug this deep?

790
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,458
How did you get this information?

791
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,127
A journalist never reveals their sources.
It's basic journalism.

792
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,265
Well, in a school like this,
I'm sure there are bureaucrats

793
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,500
among your parents, siblings, and alumni.

794
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,644
Kanzaki, what exactly
do you want to achieve in journalism?

795
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,580
Huh?

796
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,250
Your father is a renowned
newspaper journalist, isn't he?

797
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,586
Hold on, that's personal information...

798
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,155
He is the one who brought up
my personal information first.

799
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,560
[Kanzaki] So what if he is?

800
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,998
Are you writing articles like that
out of rebellion against your father?

801
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,135
You know about the press clubs, right?

802
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,236
[Mikami] Of course.

803
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,972
There are press clubs

804
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,074
in both the National Diet
and the police force

805
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,944
where the media sits obediently,
waiting for official announcements.

806
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,980
They then publish near-identical articles

807
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,483
just with slight variations in wording.

808
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,019
Of course they would, right?

809
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:24,154
After all, they all have the same source.

810
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,357
Exactly. It's Japan's unique
and wonderful system.

811
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,427
Thanks to that, Japan ranks
dead last in press freedom

812
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,029
among the G7 countries.

813
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:36,600
[Kanzaki] My father spends his days
just standing around

814
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,535
waiting for news in one of those clubs.

815
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:39,870
There's no point in rebelling
against someone like that.

816
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:40,971
So?

817
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,141
I refuse to be like that.

818
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:49,112
Press clubs are ridiculous.
They need to be abolished.

819
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,680
If things could be changed
with ideals alone

820
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,049
they would have changed already.

821
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,151
How will you change a system
that has remained unchanged

822
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,819
for over a hundred years
dating back to the Meiji era?

823
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,323
By conducting proper investigations
and writing original articles.

824
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,093
By becoming a journalist
worthy of signing my own name

825
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,594
at the end of my articles.

826
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,863
By doing that, I will change
Japan's press system.

827
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,732
You claim to have such high ideals

828
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,968
yet you didn't bother
to interview me or fact-check.

829
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,205
What you wound up writing
was this gossip article.

830
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,840
Don't you think that's strange?

831
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,744
Gossip article? What part of it is gossip?

832
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,579
Why don't you interview me now?

833
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,147
I'll answer anything.

834
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,251
What? This is ridiculous.

835
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,621
A bureaucrat willingly answering anything?

836
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,090
That's quite the rare opportunity.

837
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,593
Are you really
going to dismiss it as ridiculous?

838
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:01,852
Earlier, you said,
"Most of it is true," didn't you?

839
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,621
Then which parts aren't true?

840
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,924
It's true that I took responsibility
for the illegal retiree placements

841
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,359
and came here.

842
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,897
But strangely enough,
I have no memory of actually doing it.

843
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:15,966
Do you really think
that lie is going to fly?

844
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,368
Think about it.

845
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,171
Huh?

846
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,742
If what I'm saying is true,
what really happened?

847
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,478
Are you suggesting someone framed you?

848
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,880
It's a reasonable assumption.

849
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,748
Then why did you accept it?

850
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,017
Because I wanted to stay
in the Ministry of Education.

851
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,852
[Kanzaki] Why did you want to stay?

852
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,523
I joined the Ministry of Education
to reform the education system.

853
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,792
I wasn't going to leave
without accomplishing anything.

854
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,062
I see.

855
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,232
And yet the first thing you did
was cover for someone else's corruption?

856
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,735
Isn't that contradictory?

857
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:56,506
Like I said before,
if ideals alone could change things

858
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:57,874
they would have already changed.

859
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,345
If a bureaucrat wants to climb the ranks,
they can't do it with clean hands.

860
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,081
They need to master
bureaucratic doublespeak

861
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,150
and handle political orders instantly.

862
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,987
They push their ideals aside
to finally earn the right to participate

863
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,024
in this country's administration.

864
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,128
Maybe.

865
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:29,439
Kanzaki, the things you exposed
aren't some grand conspiracy.

866
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,876
[sighs]

867
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,945
They're just everyday occurrences.

868
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,817
Like those morning
routine videos on YouTube.

869
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,954
- [snickers]
- Shh.

870
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,658
When it's as plain as day,
you don't call it "darkness."

871
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,638
Let me ask all of you something.

872
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,409
The female teacher
Kanzaki exposed for having an affair...

873
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,613
She resigned voluntarily
and later got divorced.

874
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,681
Meanwhile, the male teacher

875
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,883
was merely transferred
to an affiliated prep school.

876
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,054
Why was it the woman
who had to leave and not the man?

877
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,190
What does that have to do with anything?

878
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,259
It's about the life you destroyed.

879
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,228
I couldn't care less about the life
of a teacher who has an affair.

880
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,666
"The personal is political."

881
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,535
Huh?

882
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,139
The personal is political.

883
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:39,976
I know that phrase.

884
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,580
Then why did you just spread gossip?
Why didn't you use your imagination there?

885
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,124
I already told you.

886
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,094
This so-called "elite"
you're striving to become

887
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,230
is just a future upper-class citizen.

888
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,336
How do you all feel
while studying for these exams?

889
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:14,177
You push through
an impossibly brutal competition

890
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,379
and at the end of it,
the life you've "earned"

891
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,814
is just that of an upper-class citizen?

892
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,119
I told you before.

893
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:27,324
"Elite" means "chosen by God."

894
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,893
And why are they chosen?

895
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,798
Because they can resist
the desires and egos

896
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,966
that would make an ordinary person falter.

897
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,602
Because they can dedicate
themselves to others

898
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,304
and to a greater cause,
not just their own gain.

899
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,408
And to that, I'd like to add
one more thing.

900
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:53,950
The true elite should dedicate themselves
to helping the weak.

901
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:59,289
[choral music playing]

902
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,825
A political journalist
who panders to politicians

903
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:05,195
and a journalist who dismisses the life
of a teacher caught in an affair...

904
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,333
I don't see how they're any different.

905
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,770
[dramatic music playing]

906
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,879
I'm done with this farce.

907
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,716
Kanzaki, don't you want
to reveal the darkness?

908
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:27,951
[door thuds]

909
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,755
[Kanzaki] Huh?

910
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,424
If you do, you couldn't find
a better source than me.

911
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,563
Don't let me go.

912
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,738
If you really want a glimpse
into the darkness

913
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,175
meet me here after school today.

914
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,925
I sincerely apologize.

915
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,428
I never expected this
to be exposed in such a way.

916
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,964
- What did the parents say?
- They haven't arrived yet.

917
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,566
This won't just go away.

918
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,303
Should we have him step down
as homeroom teacher?

919
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,072
That's not an option. I told you already.

920
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,174
Yes, I understand.

921
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:28,945
[sighs]

922
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,580
Put out this fire.

923
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,117
Otherwise, there will be
no reason for you to be here.

924
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,653
- Understood.
- Mm.

925
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:42,459
[school bell chiming]

926
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,361
[teacher] That's all for today.
See you next week.

927
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,832
[students] Thank you very much.

928
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,969
Will I be okay for the test?

929
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:58,908
So, Kanzaki is really leaving, huh?

930
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,611
After getting called out like that, yeah.

931
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,317
[Makino] Someone from Mikami's
homeroom class did this.

932
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,452
Wow, impressive.

933
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,021
They've got great investigative skills.

934
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,159
But if we just let this go

935
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,261
Pandora's Box might open, don't you think?

936
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:23,199
Huh? Pandora's Box? What do you mean?

937
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,235
Oh, I think you already know.

938
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:30,740
The box that contains
all misfortunes and calamities...

939
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,909
[laughs]

940
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,277
Oh, you're devious.

941
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,815
Don't say such ominous things.

942
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:43,186
So, before it opens, I'll take care of it.

943
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,122
All right.

944
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,893
There's someone I want you to meet.

945
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,495
I think they can be of help.

946
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,634
Understood, sir.

Bureaucrats really are the worst, huh?

950
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,747
[male student] Wasn't it Kanzaki
who broke the scoop again? He's amazing.

951
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:49,085
[female student]
But is this really a scoop, though?

952
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,787
[male student] It's a huge scoop.

953
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,324

Have a seat.

960
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,739
How was that even gossip?

961
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,211
I've sat through countless
press conferences in my line of work.

962
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:59,415
No bureaucrat would be kind enough
to tell you the truth

963
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:00,817
if you ask like that.

964
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:07,390
But now, I happen to be
an exceptionally kind teacher.

she was forced out of the school.

and now she works there.

the life you dismissed as insignificant

970

is still quietly going on.

971
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,670
So what?

972
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,775
You've heard about the murder
that occurred

973
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,277
during this year's
national civil service exam, right?

974
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,847
Some third-rate university student

975
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,183
took the exam she had no chance of passing

976
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,986
and ended up killing a Tokyo University
student who was a shoo-in to pass.

977
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,991
What if that case
is connected to your article?

978
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,061
Huh?

979
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,564
I realized something...

01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,634
there, in the darkness.

981
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,905
That that incident,
my misconduct, this school...

982
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,774
and the Ministry of Education...

983
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,845
might all be connected.

You've heard of it, haven't you?

987
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,458
A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil

988
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,828
and a tornado forms in Texas.

989
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:56,966
Small events can trigger a chain reaction
leading to something much bigger.

990
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,102
It's a well-known chaos theory.

991
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:05,908
But the most important part
is that the butterfly in Brazil

992
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:10,446
has no idea that its wings
might have caused a tornado

993
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,316

996
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,462
Because the butterfly
is just flapping its wings.

Let me think about it with you.

1011
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,445
This should be considered

1012
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:04,180
