1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,772
[tense music playing]

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,144
Is Mr. Mikami here yet?

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,614
Ms. Koreeda, is it true
that Mr. Mikami is leaving?

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,417
I'm not entirely sure myself.

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,058
Sir, is it true that you're going back
to the Ministry of Education?

6
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,427
I see word spreads fast.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,496
Could you please explain?

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,898
My colleague collapsed
and they can't manage the workload

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,901
so the Ministry approached the school
and requested that I return.

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,740
I'm going to talk to Mr. Mizohata.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,609
- [Mikami] Why don't we talk about first?
- But...

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,377
There's more.

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,381
It was implied that I might be
removed as homeroom teacher

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,482
if I don't go back.

15
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,284
Why?

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,854
[Mikami] It might be because
your test scores are dropping.

17
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,356
What? No way.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,726
[Mikami] Apparently some parents
are raising concerns.

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,163
Well, since you're all exam students,
it's a legitimate reason.

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,231
But if that happens...

21
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,367
I either get forcibly transferred
back to the Ministry of Education

22
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,036
or stay on as assistant homeroom
teacher with Ms. Koreeda taking over.

23
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,438
[Koreeda] Hold on a second.

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,675
I've been prepared to take over
as lead teacher at any time.

25
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,178
But accepting such an arbitrary
personnel decision

26
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,579
from the school is a different issue.

27
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,416
[Sakurai] Ms. Koreeda is absolutely right.

28
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,718
We absolutely must not allow a precedent
to be set where a homeroom teacher

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,454
is replaced just because
the class's grades aren't improving.

30
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,722
Weren't you the one who wanted
the teacher changed?

31
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,958
Are you still sticking with that act?

32
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,030
You're right. Let's talk.

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,711
[Mikami] The fact that this issue
is coming up

34
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,481
probably means you've developed
the ability to think.

35
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,416
What do you mean?

36
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:00,620
[Mikami] Why hasn't thinking-based
education as a goal taken root?

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,425
It's because when you try to move away
from rote memorization and cramming

38
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,229
quantifiable academic performance,
meaning test scores, temporarily drops.

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,167
The transition from a cram-free education
to its abolishment is a good example.

40
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,337
They couldn't manage the extra time given,
and when grades dropped, they panicked.

41
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:21,708
They labeled it as a failure
and reverted back to cramming.

42
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,210
But it's you guys who made that system.

43
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,845
[Mikami] True, that's right.

44
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,315
But adults now didn't receive
analytical-based education either.

45
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,519
Meaning, today's adults lack the ability
to think critically, right?

46
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,589
Those adults are the ones creating
education to foster thinking skills?

47
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,391
I think that's really difficult.

48
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,960
Being inside the system made me realize

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,963
that to reform this country's
education system

50
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,366
we are severely lacking
the very ability to think critically.

51
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,172
We are thinking seriously, though.

52
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,241
That's something you taught us, isn't it?

53
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,310
I don't think of it as me
teaching you anything.

54
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,046
But since I came to this school,
even though it's only been six months

55
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,116
it's true that you've all changed
at an incredible pace.

56
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,654
But as a result,
our test scores have dropped.

57
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,291
That's the part the school
is focusing on, right?

58
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,093
We have no choice but to get
good scores in the next exam.

59
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,599
What do you all think?

60
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,077
Right now, even if it's for Okami...

61
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,714
I can't bring myself to raise
my grades for someone else.

62
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,815
[Chigira] If I'm going to do it...

63
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,721
I want to believe it's for myself.

64
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,825
Right?

65
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,262
[Shiiba] Yeah.

66
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,731
[gentle piano music plays]

67
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,100
I don't want to participate
in some point-scoring game

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,636
just to prove the school wrong.

69
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:06,045
There's something Okami said
that stuck with me.

70
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,651
That what we're aiming for
is to become "upper-class citizens."

71
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,955
If I were on my deathbed
and someone told me

72
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:21,294
"You were an upper-class citizen,"
I think I'd be humiliated.

73
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,131
A "true elite"...?

74
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,235
It's not that I want to be
someone chosen by God or anything.

75
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,772
But if I only get one life

76
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,143
part of me wants to be someone
who's at least useful to others.

77
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,416
Entrance exams are not the goal,
they're the means.

78
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,386
But...

79
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,955
or rather, because of that

80
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,759
I think it means something
that we, who understand that

81
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,394
aim for the University of Tokyo.

82
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,597
I think so too.

83
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,501
And I couldn't care less about
my personal pride.

84
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:07,273
I just want these next three months
of your lives to be meaningful.

85
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,443
That's my only wish.

86
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,946
[emotional string music playing]

87
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,919
There's something I've been
thinking for a while now.

88
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,788
[Koreeda] Will you share it?

89
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,858
Lately, I've been wondering

90
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,228
could we share
study methods with each other?

91
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,731
[Wakui] I want to enrich
the experience of studying itself.

92
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,801
If that's the case,
I have a lot I'd love to share.

93
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,104
That's a good idea.
I want to do that. I want to try it.

94
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,607
[Tsugimoto] Let me summarize.

95
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,945
We'll come up with our own study methods.

96
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,415
And while we're at it, we'll save Okami.

97
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,983
How does that sound?

98
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,885
[all] Sounds great!

99
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,088
You'll help us, right?

100
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,290
[Mikami] If needed, of course.

101
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
You too, Ms. Koreeda?

102
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,132
[student] All right, let's do this!

103
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,668
[boy] Let's go for it.

104
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,572
[triumphant orchestral music playing]

105
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:21,881
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

106
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,720
Mizohata, you understand
this is your last chance, right?

107
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,923
Of course I understand.

108
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,293
Now that you've played the card

109
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,295
of demoting
a bureaucrat-appointed teacher

110
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,464
there's no turning back.

111
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,500
Is that clear?

112
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,769
Yes, sir.

113
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,203
Okay.

114
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,411
[Kodai writing]

115
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,512
Chairman Kodai.

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,815
[sighs] What is it?

117
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:03,356
Chairman, you once
asked if there was a way

118
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,658
for me to be saved if you collapsed.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,430
When I heard that, I thought...

120
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:16,135
would there ever be a case
where I collapse

121
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,805
and only you walk away clean?

122
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,508
So what about it?

123
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,981
I know a lot of things.

124
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,286
You can't just cut off the lizard's tail

125
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,823
and expect that to be the end of it.

126
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,360
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,466
If everything came to light,
it would be a big problem, wouldn't it?

128
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,939
For me you mean?

129
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,544
Or a problem for all of us?

130
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,585
[Makino] Isn't that too extreme?

131
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:09,188
"Come back to the Ministry or be
replaced as homeroom teacher."

132
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,727
Makino, are you worried about
something if Mikami returns?

133
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,496
[tense music]

134
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,965
No, not at all.

135
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,201
It's just that both internally
and externally, the optics will be...

136
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,871
[chuckles] What are you trying to say?

137
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,808
If he were to come back
only halfway through his post

138
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,077
it's like admitting that
the Ministry's bureaucrat placement

139
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,779
in a private school was a failure.

140
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,084
So then if we do bring him back

141
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,120
we will have to pair it with
an extraordinary promotion.

142
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:43,823
What?

143
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,059
Oh? Was that the real issue all along?

144
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,032
Well, I kind of get how you feel.

145
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,304
If Mikami gets promoted here,
he'd become a division chief.

146
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:03,209
Which would make him the highest-ranking
among your cohort.

147
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,415
But you know, what's best for
the whole system is more important.

148
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,452
You understand that, don't you, Makino?

149
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,691
[Makino] Of course, sir.

150
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,565
Anyway, once he's back at the Ministry,
he can still be of great use.

151
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,168
You know that better than anyone, right?

152
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:37,043
Hey, now's not the time to be
worrying about others, Makino.

153
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,681
Excuse me.

154
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,316
Yes.

155
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,520
[tense music continues]

156
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,702
Yes, I've spoken with Makino.

157
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,238
He seemed pretty flustered.

158
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,408
[chuckles] He's quite the ambitious man.

159
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,178
I've spoken with Mizohata too.

160
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:17,917
From here on out, no matter who stays,
Mizohata is not an option.

161
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,153
[Kodai] But, well, he does have a mortgage

162
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,323
and his child is preparing for
elementary school entrance exams

163
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,127
so I don't think he'll go blabbing.

164
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:33,099
If we can't bring Mikami in,
then I guess it'll have to be Makino.

165
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,768
The question is what to do about Nakaoka.

166
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,504
Eventually, they'll all
become troublesome...

167
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,474
these men who know too much.

168
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,479
[door opens]

169
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,081
- I'm home.
- Takuto.

170
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,251
What?

171
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,288
Have you been visiting Yuzuru Mayama?

172
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,358
Huh?

173
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,832
This came in the mail.

174
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,834
YUZURU MAYAMA

175
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,976
Stop playing newspaper reporter right now.

176
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,812
What gives you the right to say that?

177
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:20,946
This is...

178
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,053
This isn't something to
halfheartedly dig into.

179
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,763
I'm not doing this halfheartedly.

180
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,978
[Mayama] To Mr. Takuto Kanzaki

181
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:59,185
I'm not confident I can calmly tell you
this within the limited visitation time

182
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,489
so I wrote out
the story of my life up to now.

183
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,629
To be honest, remembering it is so painful

184
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,668
that I even start to wonder
if I'm just writing endless lies.

185
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,139
But even so...

186
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,877
this is everything I can recall

187
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,781
and it is my truth.

188
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,589
My very first memory is of
my father hitting my mother.

189
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,458
- [thumps]
- [breathing heavily]

190
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,663
- [grunts] Stop it, please. Yuzuru is...
- Don't talk back!

191
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,398
[yells, sobs]

192
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,068
[Saejima panting]

193
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,537
[gasps] Yuzuru.

194
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,808
Yuzuru... It's okay. You're okay.

195
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,578
[somber music playing]

196
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:18,197
[Mayama] I always got overwhelmed
and couldn't organize my thoughts.

197
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,467
That started in my freshman year
of high school.

198
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,302
[indistinct chatter]

199
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,647
"You're disliked for a reason."

200
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,717
That was a painful thing to hear.

201
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,858
But what hurt even more
was knowing it was true.

202
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,863
Why am I hated?

203
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,034
I didn't know how to talk to people.

204
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,637
But I was proud...

205
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,109
and I couldn't function
unless I believed I was special.

206
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,178
[sobs]

207
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,747
[ominous music playing]

208
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,756
[Wakui] Could you pass this to the back?

209
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,393
[indistinct chatter]

210
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,300
[chatter continues]

211
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,073
- Good morning.
- [students] Good morning.

212
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,775
I heard you all gathered early
for a strategy meeting.

213
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,278
Mind if I record this?

214
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,913
[all] Sure, go ahead.

215
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,183
[camera clicks, beeps]

216
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,752
- [Wakui] All right, let's begin.
- Yes.

217
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,223
In this class, the basic
academic ability is there.

218
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,791
You've also completed your Exam Matrix

219
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,793
and have a better understanding
of your academic abilities, right?

220
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,696
[Wakui] But your grades are stagnant.

221
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,165
Why do you think that is?

222
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,135
[Sakurai] That's what's puzzling.

223
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,938
- We're just getting started.
- Thanks.

224
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,940
[Tokumori] It's not a mystery.

225
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,478
Our study time has drastically decreased.

226
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,813
[Muraoka] But is that the only reason?

227
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,883
[Tokumori] Why do you say that?

228
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,090
Personally, I don't feel like
my academic ability has dropped.

229
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,092
That's because you've actually
been studying, Muraoka.

230
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,194
So do you think your ability
has declined, Tokumori?

231
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,701
In absolute terms, probably not.

232
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,437
But my rank is slowly slipping.

233
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,309
Ah! I actually analyzed that a bit.

234
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,183
I had some people share their test results

235
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,685
and I broke down the data.

236
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,556
According to the analysis,
it's not that our scores are dropping

237
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,094
it's that we've stayed
the same since our junior year.

238
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,832
Meanwhile, other students
are studying hard and improving

239
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,968
so naturally, our standings drop.

240
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,405
Go ahead. Keep going.

241
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:17,209
We'll map this into the Exam Matrix.
[clicks fingers]

242
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,412
[students] Whoa, that's cool.

243
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,716
[Tsugimoto] And from that, each person's
current issue becomes clear.

244
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,519
Basically, it means we need to get
back to the fundamentals of studying.

245
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,390
But won't that just become
studying for the sake of studying again?

246
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,726
[Tsugimoto inhales sharply] Exactly.

247
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,328
[Wakui] But we also want
short-term results

248
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,163
so we still need to focus on efficiency.

249
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,401
How do you study, Wakui?

250
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,371
[Wakui] Honestly,
it's probably pretty inefficient.

251
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,975
"Happy Henry Likes Beer
But Could Not Obtain Food."

252
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,345
That's a famous mnemonic
for memorizing elements, right?

253
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,015
But I don't really use that method.

254
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,616
[Tsugimoto] Go deeper on that.

255
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,819
For example, when the Big Bang happened

256
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,123
only hydrogen and helium
appeared in the universe.

257
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,824
Hydrogen's symbol is "H"

258
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,261
and the word "hydrogen" comes from Greek,
meaning "water's origin."

259
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,531
[Wakui] The Hydra is the sea serpent
from Greek mythology.

260
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,665
That's amazing.

261
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,303
Just from hydrogen, you get the origin
of the universe, history, and myth.

262
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,041
And if you think of hydrogen as energy,
it connects to environmental issues too.

263
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,509
It can go anywhere.

264
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,244
Wow.

265
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,548
It's said that memory peaks
when you're young

266
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,651
and that's true, but the brain
actually gets better as you age.

267
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,186
[all] Really?

268
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,554
As your knowledge accumulates

269
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,524
your synapses extend
and connect brain cells.

270
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,359
That moment of connection
is called "understanding."

271
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,129
And they say real comprehension
deepens after age 30.

272
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,965
[Mikami] Though that means

273
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,301
you have to put in a lot of effort
while you're younger.

274
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,473
One book I read said how you
approach turning 30 is crucial.

275
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,308
How exactly is it important?

276
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,013
Well, I'll be turning 30 soon, so...

277
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,648
[Koreeda and students chuckling]

278
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,750
[Mikami] For example,
if you spend that day reading a book

279
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,985
you'll be able to build a lifelong
relationship with language

280
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,620
and read deeply.

281
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,623
[Koreeda] That feels doable.
I'll give it a try.

282
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,258
Whoa, 30, huh?

283
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,227
I'd better watch out
or I'll end up wasting it carelessly.

284
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,496
- [boy] That's true!
- [laughter]

285
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,531
So, Okami, how did you spend that day?

286
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,201
[Mikami] I was writing
Diet replies at work

287
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,103
and before I knew it, it was the next day.

288
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,471
That's awful.

289
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,040
Everyone else had gone home,
and I was alone on that floor

290
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,210
thinking about the future
of Japan as I turned 30.

291
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,812
[Mikami] As a bureaucrat,
that was the most luxurious birthday

292
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,080
I could've asked for.

293
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,615
Sounds like sour grapes.

294
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,817
[students laughing]

295
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,821
[Kanzaki] That is a luxury.
Don't you get it?

296
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,324
What's wrong, Kanzaki?

297
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,101
Nothing.

298
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,440
Sorry.

299
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,744
[Tsugimoto] Kanzaki.

300
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:11,917
Hey, Kanzaki, I'd like you to take
charge of the essay questions.

301
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,057
Got it.

302
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,061
All right then, let's start
right after school today.

303
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,863
[students] Okay.

304
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,998
[boy] Let's do it.

305
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,333
[indistinct chatter]

306
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,373
[somber music playing]

307
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,178
And there's this principle.

308
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:43,649
Even vague things like human senses
can be explained mathematically.

309
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,785
- Huh? Logs are kinda cute.
- [laughter]

310
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,854
[Wakui] Right?
When you look at it that way...

311
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,890
Instead of starting at one English word
until you memorize it

312
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,526
it's better to study like a quiz game.

313
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,130
Because it includes
the process of recalling...

314
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,099
- [in English] Oh, active recall!
- Yes.

315
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,269
[in Japanese] And adding game elements,
neurologically speaking

316
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,938
boosts motivation.

317
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,372
[Tsugimoto] Okay, let's start right away.

318
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,508
The students seem energized.

319
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,244
I've got to update
my teaching methods too.

320
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,581
Ms. Koreeda, when you
were in school, were you...

321
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,953
Just as you imagine, I used to
stare down at my vocabulary book

322
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,589
and wouldn't sleep
until I finished my quota.

323
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,557
- Pure grit.
- Yes.

324
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,393
[chuckles] Looking back now,
I feel like a fossil.

325
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,097
Like a platypus.
You know what I mean, right?

326
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,867
The platypus hasn't changed
since prehistoric times.

327
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,770
In other words, it's an animal
with strong persistence.

328
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,806
One could also say it's inflexible.

329
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,574
Nice bit of self-deprecation.

330
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,011
That's critical thinking.

331
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,381
In order to update oneself,
it's essential, isn't it?

332
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,784
Okami, what is "kyubo-shita" in English?

333
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,853
[in English] Indigent.

334
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,088
[students in Japanese] Oh, nice.

335
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,389
How about "genshoku no"?

336
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,490
[in English] Incumbent.

337
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,859
[Tsugimoto in Japanese] Wow, impressive!

338
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,164
[Mikami] Ms. Koreeda, do you know
what animal has the most endurance?

339
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,399
I have no idea.

340
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,468
[Mikami] Prepare to be surprised.
It's humans.

341
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,969
What? No way.

342
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:15,607
No animals can run 26 miles
faster than a human.

343
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,344
We really ought to put
that endurance to use.

344
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,546
Here's another story.

345
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,783
There used to be a zoo
that had a cage for humans.

346
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,585
And on the plaque, it said...

347
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:27,686
Okay.

348
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,691
"Among all animals in the world,
the strongest and the weakest

349
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,092
is the human."

350
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:44,836
Right now, I feel like I'm looking
at the strongest creature on Earth.

351
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,407
I agree.

352
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,109
[sentimental music playing]

353
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,514
Let's protect them, no matter what.

354
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,089
[birds chirping]

355
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,030
[exhales deeply]

356
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,808
[Koreeda] Thank you for the tea.

357
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,795
[Koreeda's mother] You should
come to lessons once in a while.

358
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,666
It's embarrassing if my own daughter
doesn't know her manners.

359
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,572
About what we discussed earlier...

360
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,942
I've decided not to get involved
in the school's management.

361
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,278
But you still donate regularly
to Rintoku, don't you?

362
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:05,283
I donate simply because I agree
with Mr. Kodai's philosophy.

363
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,120
And once you give money,
you shouldn't interfere.

364
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,621
That's what education is.

365
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,692
But if wrongdoing is involved,
that's a different story.

366
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,695
[choral music playing]

367
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,963
[chuckles softly]

368
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,166
It's only because of my credibility
that they accepted you.

369
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,837
I didn't ask you to do that.

370
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,611
You did that on your own.

371
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,149
[bird tweeting]

372
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,988
[man] Reiko-san, your student is here.

373
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,796
I ask that you refrain from
doing anything to shame me.

374
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,000
[Koreeda] I didn't choose this school
for myself.

375
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,170
But...

376
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,908
Rintoku has become a special place for me.

377
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:11,316
I want to protect it and its students.

378
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,387
[choral music continues]

379
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,967
Would you like some coffee?

380
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,715
[exhales] It's good.

381
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,617
I'm glad to hear that.

382
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,453
Your mom never drinks it.

383
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,423
She says a tea ceremony instructor
shouldn't drink coffee.

384
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,460
You're very patient, Dad.

385
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,262
Well, I did marry into the family.

386
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,164
That shouldn't matter.

387
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,002
Hey, Dad, do you know anything?

388
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,305
Hmm... not really.

389
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,876
But isn't everyone around here
donating to Rintoku?

390
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,578
Your mother takes care of all that stuff.

391
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,216
Ah, but if I'm not mistaken...

392
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,920
there was something about
Mr. Koshi from the printing company.

393
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,555
Mr. Koshi?

394
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,723
Yes, Mr. Koshi.

395
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,493
It's written with the characters
for "high" and "aspiration."

396
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,264
The previous president
really admired Mr. Kodai

397
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,233
so he brought together
everyone in this area.

398
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,202
Koshi...

399
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,972
KOSHI PRINTING COMPANY

400
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,208
- [pensive music playing]
- Koshi?

401
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,147
KOSHI PRINTING COMPANY

402
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,790
[director] Back in my father's time,
we were like a cheering squad for Rintoku.

403
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,027
But since I took over,
we haven't been in touch.

404
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,196
Did your father leave behind anything?

405
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,865
Like documents?

406
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:11,136
Oh, he was super organized,
so he kept a list, like a registry.

407
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,539
About six months ago,
someone from Rintoku came by

408
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,107
and I handed it over.

409
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,410
Do you remember that person's name?

410
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,245
Let me see...

411
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,786
This person.

412
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,589
[tense music playing]

413
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,894
- [knocking on door]
- Yes?

414
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,029
[door opens]

415
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,698
Uh...

416
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,734
Whoa! No way, it's Mr. Mikami!

417
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,302
I just happened to be nearby.

418
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,870
[chuckles]

419
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,472
I'm really happy you came.

420
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,740
[chuckling] Are you sure?

421
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,810
I thought I might be a bother,
so I wasn't sure if I should come.

422
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,944
Not at all.

423
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,982
If you like, you can read this.

424
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,651
Ah! Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

425
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,289
How's teaching? Is it fulfilling?

426
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,192
Oh... Let me tell you.

427
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,894
It really is.

428
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,098
[chuckling] Is that right? I thought so.

429
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,166
High school seniors, you know...

430
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,970
they're not quite adults,
but not kids either.

431
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,873
They're kind of strange creatures.

432
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,643
- Strange?
- [chuckling] It's hard to explain.

433
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,247
They have this strong life force,
yet they're incredibly delicate.

434
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,717
And their pace of change
is as fast as plankton.

435
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,221
You can't take your eyes
off them for even a moment.

436
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,957
Were we like that too?

437
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,127
Oh, there was that business
competition, right?

438
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,463
- Yeah.
- Actually, it really moved me.

439
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,932
Honestly, I was surprised too.

440
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,169
Seeing you surrounded
by your students afterwards

441
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,705
- I was so envious.
- [chuckles]

442
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,007
[melancholy cello music playing]

443
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,045
I actually have a teaching license.

444
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,146
[Mikami] Hmm!

445
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,882
That day, I thought if there's
ever another chance after you

446
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,550
I'd want to give it a try.

447
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,019
You should. I think you'd be a great fit.

448
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,156
Really? That makes me happy. [chuckling]

449
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,459
But first focus on having
a successful surgery.

450
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,262
- Right.
- Hm.

451
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,970
[buttons clacking]

452
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,708
[computer game noises]

453
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,244
[melancholy cello music continues]

454
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,723
[music ends]

455
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,762
So, "Yamato Takeru no Mikoto"
was you, wasn't it?

456
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,199
Where's this coming from?

457
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,935
You know Mr. Koshi, right?

458
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,172
He said you took the donor list.

459
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,209
Good job figuring that out.

460
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:13,017
The Kusanagi sword came from
the tail of the Yamata-no-Orochi.

461
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,989
And the large snake is said
to have come from Koshi's land

462
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,458
around present-day Niigata.

463
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:25,730
So, I thought perhaps
it's connected to the corruption...

464
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,735
But I'm not Yamato Takeru.

465
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,606
Still, I do have something
I want to say about the corruption.

466
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,741
- What?
- Come with me.

467
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,178
[choral music playing]

468
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,250
I'm sorry, Koreeda.

469
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
[Koreeda] What is this about?

470
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,123
It started when
a student came to talk to me.

471
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,093
She thought she might've
gotten in through unfair means.

472
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,730
Her self-assessed scores
weren't high enough, she said.

473
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,234
Then why is Mr. Mikami involved?

474
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,573
Kota Mikami...

475
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:15,446
his older brother was
my boyfriend back in high school.

476
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,016
What?

477
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,553
So when I heard the Ministry of Education
was sending a teacher

478
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,289
through that dispatch program,
I asked for a favor.

479
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:30,228
So it was you, Ms. Isshiki?
You're Yamato Takeru?

480
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,130
No, it's not me.

481
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,336
If you know this much,
why not go public right now?

482
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,039
There is no conclusive evidence

483
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,576
that Nagatacho and Kasumigaseki
gave Rintoku favorable subsidies

484
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,845
in exchange for favorable admissions.

485
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,247
[Koreeda] What about Mr. Koshi's records?

486
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,350
It's a record of donations from
local chamber of commerce members.

487
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,253
The amount was quite large,
but it was all above board.

488
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,724
So, it's not proof.

489
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,059
[Mikami] Right.

490
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,163
It's unforgivable.

491
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:11,736
[Koreeda] Saying all the right things
while making money off children's lives...

492
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,273
taking advantage of
my mother's goodwill like that...

493
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,076
[Mikami] Exactly.

494
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,448
Isn't there anything I can do?

495
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,418
This is about my student.

496
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,290
I understand.

497
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,826
There's something I'd like your help with.

498
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:35,994
[Koreeda] What is it?

499
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,897
It's "Plan Okami Two."

500
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,939
[Mayama] Kanzaki, you once told me...

501
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,745
[Kanzaki] Is your goal
revenge against your father?

502
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,014
Huh?

503
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:01,052
To get back at my journalist dad,
I exposed Ms. Saejima's scandal.

504
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,490
[Mayama] What I was thinking
at that time...

505
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:07,859
It was...

506
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:14,866
envy at you for being able
to hate your father like that.

507
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:22,040
There are parents in this world you
don't even want to feel anything for.

508
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:31,449
I came to be dominated by a single phrase.

509
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,987
It was a quote
from a certain revolutionary.

510
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:45,797
"If the world changes you,
then you can change the world."

511
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,568
I wanted to change.

512
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,439
I...

513
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,044
I so desperately wanted to change.

514
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,315
[pensive music playing]

515
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,151
[Tsugimoto] Kanzaki!

516
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,191
Wanna come to my place today?

517
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,460
I found something about that case.

518
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,870
Hey, Lupin, class roster 2019.

519
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,971
[Lupin] Sure thing.

520
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,008
Usually, when there's an issue
with a student

521
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,178
the school has them stay home
until disciplinary action is taken.

522
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,613
Shiiba was like that, right?

523
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:40,184
So I filtered out students whose
absences weren't clearly explained.

524
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,754
Over the past ten years

525
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,991
there's only one student in
Ms. Saejima's class who matched...

526
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,593
and boom!

527
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,162
[in English] Hey, Lupin, Tokura's data.

528
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,997
[Lupin in Japanese] Opening now.

529
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,603
[Tsugimoto] He was absent
for a week after finals.

530
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,906
He wasn't disciplined for anything,
but it's curious, right?

531
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,610
Send this address to my phone.

532
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,011
Uh, wait, are you going there?

533
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,313
I want to talk to him as soon as possible.

534
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,616
What is this about?

535
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,419
[Lupin] We're now nearing the climax!

536
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,634
[doorbell ringing]

537
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,177
Bringing Mikami back
and promoting him to department head?

538
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,313
No one's going to accept
such a ridiculous personnel move.

539
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,283
You were gunning for
that position, right, Makino?

540
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,018
[Makino] Of course.

541
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,955
After everything I've done,
Mikami beats me to it.

542
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,457
I'll be a laughingstock.

543
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:59,697
If I'm being honest,
I'm not about to let this slide.

544
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,537
[both chuckling]

545
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,074
[atmospheric music playing]

546
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:33,865
Are you from Rintoku?

547
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,803
You're Itsuki Tokura, right?

548
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,743
My name's Kanzaki.

549
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,814
Could I talk to you for a moment?

550
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,486
[tense music playing]

551
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,658
[phone buzzes]

552
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,261
[in English] "Verbose."

553
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,729
[in Japanese] It means... "mawarikudoi!"

554
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,764
- Oh, correct!
- Nice!

555
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,135
Okay, next... "To squander something."

556
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,236
You're not joining us, Tominaga?

557
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,704
Sorry, something's come up.
[in English] Bye-bye!

558
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,306
[all in Japanese] See you tomorrow.

559
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,675
[tense music continues]

560
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,267
[tense music continues]

561
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,171
[Mikami] Plan Okami Two.

562
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,778
[tense music continues]

563
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,489
Mr. Mizohata, do you have a moment?

564
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,529
If possible, I'd like to
speak with you in private.

565
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,435
[knocking]

566
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,238
- [Kodai] Come in.
- [Mikami] Excuse me.

567
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,842
Oh my, this is unusual.

568
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,178
- [chuckles softly] Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.

569
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,548
In the six months I've been at Rintoku

570
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,085
I've been moved
by your remarkable educational vision.

571
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,155
The school's philosophy
is deeply ingrained in every student

572
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,124
and I find myself amazed every day.

573
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:46,264
I'm surprised to hear
that you feel that way.

574
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,531
[Mikami chuckles]

575
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:07,151
[Koreeda] When I first joined this school,
it was you who mentored me.

576
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,990
You stayed close to the students
and respected their independence.

577
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:20,798
You taught me the essence
of what education should be.

578
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,672
But lately...

579
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,009
it seems like you've
forgotten those ideals.

580
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,881
But...

581
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,417
to me...

582
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,655
it looks like you're
carrying a heavy burden.

583
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:47,958
[exhales]

584
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,729
I have no idea what you mean.

585
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:10,314
[tense music playing]

586
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,515
MURDER SUSPECT YUZURU MAYAMA
IS SAEJIMA'S DAUGHTER

587
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,387
What about it?

588
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,259
I'll get right to the point.
We found out who sent this.

589
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,500
The person who sent this...

590
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,409
was you, wasn't it, Mr. Mizohata?

591
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,815
It's well known that Nagatacho
and Kasumigaseki

592
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:48,552
still use fax machines
to send sensitive documents.

593
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,323
But there's something we
bureaucrats are taught first.

594
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,594
Never send multiple faxes from
the same convenience store.

595
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,497
Especially not from one near your home.

596
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,732
The reason being...

597
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,237
[Koreeda] Because the store number
is printed right here.

598
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,909
[Mikami] And this number
matches the convenience store

599
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,811
nearest to Mr. Mizohata's home.

600
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,684
[sighs]

601
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:29,560
Is that really enough
to count as evidence?

602
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,796
I went to that store and asked.

603
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,104
They confirmed that this man
was the one who sent it.

604
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,039
[sighs]

605
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,276
Why would he do such a thing?

606
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,850
From my end, I have no intention
of making this public.

607
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,219
But...

608
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,255
But what?

609
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:05,796
Mr. Mizohata, I'd like you
to tell me everything you know.

610
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,801
I don't know what you're talking about.

611
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,837
This school is engaged
in illicit behavior.

612
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,141
[stirring music playing]

613
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,617
And all the dirty work
has long been pushed onto you.

614
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:36,160
You've endured so much
this whole time, haven't you?

615
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,769
What would someone like you

616
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,373
someone who was raised in comfort,
possibly understand?

617
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,474
I do understand!

618
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,679
I was finally entrusted
with being a homeroom teacher

619
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,349
and then I was replaced.

620
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,620
That kind of frustration...

621
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,192
no amount of money can fix that.

622
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,432
But...

623
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,670
there's no turning back for me.

624
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,374
Maybe you can't turn back...

625
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:31,582
but you can move forward.

626
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,685
[emotional music continues]

627
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,959
[Mikami] If you leave it to me,
I believe I can persuade Mr. Mizohara

628
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,595
to stand down quietly.

629
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,368
[Kodai] What's your goal?

630
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,872
To achieve true educational reform.

631
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,811
You and I share
the same educational ideals.

632
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:05,082
Let's join forces and turn Rintoku
into the top school in Japan.

633
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,385
[music swells]

634
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,468
[door closes]

[exhales shakily]

636
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,074
[audiobook plays in English]
Fantine heard.

637
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,475
You do not have Cosette?

638
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,212
Fantine's pale face
turned absolutely white.

639
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:39,116
All her strength left her
and a single tear rolled down her face.

640
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,118
THE NEVERENDING STORY

641
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,020
I shall not see my child.

642
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,289
- [doorbell ringing]
- She closed her eyes

643
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,693
and with one last breath,
Fantine's head fell limply to the side.

644
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,794
She was dead.

645
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,302
[Tokura in Japanese] Ms. Saejima.

646
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,205
It's been a while.

647
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,608
Why are you here?

648
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,077
[Kanzaki] Ms. Saejima.

649
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,313
You were protecting him.

650
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,849
You were protecting Tokura, weren't you.

00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,085

[student] Okami!

654
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,568
- [Mikami] What happened?
- It's Tominaga...

655
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,437
Is something wrong with Tominaga?

656
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,039
I just got a call.

657
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,908
[Tsugimoto] Hello?

658
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,448
Help me.

659
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,185
[Tsugimoto] Huh?

660
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,688
Where are you right now?

661
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,357
[sniffles]

662
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,659
Okami will know.

663
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,796
[cries]

664
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,067
Do you have any idea where she might be?

665
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,007
Let's go.

666
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,143
[Mikami] We can finally expose
the full scope of Rintoku's corruption.

667
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,446
[Koreeda] Saying it might have been
an illegitimate admission...

668
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,748
[Kanzaki] Isn't this decisive evidence?

669
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:20,751
YAMATO TAKERU APPEARS

670
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,287
So you're choosing Mikami.

671
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,458
Anyone without a vision for education
needs to step aside.

672
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,593
[Mikami] Deceiving the enemy
starts with deceiving your own side.

673
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,261
Are you okay just leaving it like this?

674
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,298
[Tokura] By protecting me,
she ended up doing something terrible.

675
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,100
[Kanzaki] So a deal really was made,
wasn't it?

676
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:40,003
And the real reason
why you left the school wasn't an affair.

677
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,874
[Mikami] They need to act now.
He is trying to win me over.
