1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,071
[girl 1] Ms. Saejima?

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,741
Ms. Saejima? Really?

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,110
Let's show it to everyone
in the classroom.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,578
Yeah, let's go.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,818
- [girl 2] It's been half a year.
- [boy 1] What...?

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,854
[boy 2] Hey, Ms. Saejima's here.

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,226
UNFIT TO TEACH! AFFAIR BETWEEN
ENGLISH TEACHERS EXPOSED!

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,997
[students whispering]

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,198
[tense music playing]

10
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,161
RINTOKU NEWSPAPER AFFAIR EXPOSED!

11
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,675
[gentle music playing]

12
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,600
[student] Ah, this is depressing.

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,002
I wonder if our homeroom
teacher will change?

14
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,105
Right? I mean he basically
committed a crime...

15
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,275
I felt so down,
I couldn't focus on studying.

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,944
Right? Like, give me a break.

17
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,282
[Fuyuki] I don't think he'll be replaced.

18
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,151
Huh? Why not?

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,019
Come on, there's no way they didn't know.

20
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,622
The school accepted him
fully aware of the situation.

21
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,491
[student] So, the school deliberately
took in a burden?

22
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,959
What a pain in the ass.

23
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,162
[girl 1] And as homeroom teacher
for a senior class?

24
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,197
That's seriously rough.

25
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,868
Like, what do they think our lives are?

26
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,206
After everything that was said,
that's what you're stuck on?

27
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,742
[Fuyuki] Huh? What?

28
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,945
[girl 2] When we were asked
why the one who got dismissed

29
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,548
was a woman, it's not like
any of us had a response.

30
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,251
Maybe we should think a little more
about what that actually meant.

31
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,855
If being a true elite includes character

32
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,623
then that guy is the worst one of all.

33
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,625
There's no point in taking his bait.

34
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,265
I never said
I consider myself a true elite.

35
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,568
You might as well have.

36
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,604
Fuyuki-kun

37
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,640
why don't we aim for it together?

38
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,515
[Mikami] All right, let's begin. Page 38.

39
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,752
[triumphant music playing]

40
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:54,033
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

41
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,316
[Koreeda] Excuse me, Mr. Mizohata.

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,417
What is it?

43
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,457
Do you know why Ms. Saejima was dismissed?

44
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,265
I heard she resigned on her own.

45
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,366
That's all I know.

46
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,970
Mr. Mizohata, could you
come here for a moment?

47
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,372
[Mizohata] What is it?

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,506
It's about that thing with Mr. Mikami.

49
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,041
[Yoshikawa] A parent is on the phone...

50
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,843
[sighs] All right.

51
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,144
I'll take it.

52
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,884
Hello, thank you for calling.

53
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,654
This is Koreeda,
the assistant homeroom teacher.

54
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,489
Yes. Yes...

55
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,557
[Kodai] How are things
on the parents' side?

56
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,962
To begin with, many parents
don't have a favorable opinion

57
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,298
of Kanzaki-kun, so most of
the complaints are directed at him.

58
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,634
Well, he is our school's ace.
There's bound to be some jealousy.

59
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,070
Kanzaki-kun our ace? Are you serious?

60
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,171
Quite serious.

61
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,846
Even if he seems like a nuisance now

62
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,650
a few years after graduation,
he'll bring honor to our school.

63
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,621
No one dislikes a genius
with a rebellious spirit.

64
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,556
That may be,
but regarding this situation...

65
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,925
I've had my concerns
for a while, Mizobata-san.

66
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,226
It's "Mizohata."

67
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:32,098
You need to adopt a more
long-term perspective.

68
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,501
That's the most important thing
in education.

69
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,538
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,839
[Kodai] We're done here.

71
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,275
Excuse me.

72
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,943
RINTOKU
VIRTUE IS NOT SOLITARY

73
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,978
IT IS SURE TO HAVE NEIGHBORS
INSCRIBED BY NOBUYUKI KITAYAMA

74
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,323
Thanks for going out for an interview.

75
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,960
Huh?

76
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,829
If you're going, you should go soon.

77
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,999
I know. I don't need you to tell me.

78
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,803
[tense piano music playing]

79
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,148
Thank you very much.

80
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,828
Welcome...

81
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,434
Ms. Saejima, it's been a while.

82
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,736
Please leave.

83
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,704
Can we talk?

84
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,474
When your shift ends...

85
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,476
I work the late shift.

86
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,812
Then, how about tomorrow?

87
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,917
Why the hell should I talk to you?

88
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,088
Did something happen?

89
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,190
No, sir.

90
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,459
I'm very sorry I couldn't be of help.

91
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,613
Yo.

92
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,818
[chuckles]

93
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,520
Wait up.

94
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,592
Ms. Saejima was in that
convenience store, right?

95
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,462
You knew?

96
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,130
Need some help?

97
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,999
Huh?

98
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,434
I can be useful, you know.

99
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,736
I won a top prize
in the National Mathematics Contest.

100
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,471
My specialty is programming.

101
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,673
Isn't that amazing
for a liberal arts student?

102
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,479
Look, I don't need any help, okay?

103
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,450
Wait up!

104
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,523
[Kanzaki] Just go home already.

105
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,624
[student] Home is that way.

106
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,195
AFFAIR BETWEEN
SAEJIMA AND TSUTSUI EXPOSED!

107
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,904
THANK YOU MS. KOREEDA!

108
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,373
MR. KINPACHI IN CLASS 3-B

109
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,343
[Mikami] Since J+C=0, C=1/4.

110
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,022
- [student 1] Hey, wait a sec...
- [student 2] I need more time.

111
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:21,327
[Mikami] Huh? I was just about
to give a new study hint.

112
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,662
A hint?

113
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:28,601
Write down
what you learned today on this paper.

114
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,938
Huh? At least give us problems to solve.

115
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,240
[Mikami] If I do that,
it'll be a quiz, right?

116
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,642
If you really need problems,
come up with your own.

117
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,946
Please explain the intent behind this.

118
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,750
This is what you call
"active recall," right?

119
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,019
Oh, you know about it?

120
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,221
- Give me a moment.
- [Mikami] Go ahead.

121
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,000
This was an actual experiment
conducted in the U.S.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,970
One group studied once,
another group studied twice

123
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,472
and another kept reviewing repeatedly.

124
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,407
Which group do you think
performed the best?

125
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,711
The group that kept reviewing, right?

126
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:16,315
Actually, there was a difference
between studying once and twice

127
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,819
but after that, repeating it
didn't make much of a difference.

128
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,454
[student 1] Wait, really?

129
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:26,659
And then, between those
who made mind maps and those who

130
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,228
actively recalled information

131
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,131
the ones who practiced recalling it
had the best learning outcomes.

132
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,066
[student 2] Really?

133
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,403
That's active recall?

134
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,239
ACTIVE RECALL

135
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,340
Correct.

136
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,210
So what, Wakui?
Are you Okami's apprentice now?

137
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,846
Not really.

138
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,448
If something is good,
it doesn't matter who suggests it.

139
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,289
It can be done anywhere

140
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,760
even while getting jostled
in a packed train.

141
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,264
That's it for today's lesson.

142
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,567
Whether you do it or not is up to you.

143
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,638
[school bell ringing]

144
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,078
So, differential and integral calculus...

145
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,179
Do you remember it?

146
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,996
[light pensive music playing]

147
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,667
Whoa, you scared me!

148
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,704
Hey, I need to talk to you. Come with me.

149
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,539
- Huh?
- Just come with me.

150
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,675
- What is it?
- About yesterday...

151
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,477
I'll do some independent digging too.

152
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,547
How about we report back
if anything notable comes up?

153
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,749
Kanzaki, where were you yesterday?

154
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,354
You're bothered by
what Okami said, aren't you?

155
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,592
Shut up.

156
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,695
Wait!

157
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,963
So...

158
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,813
- [students] Goodbye.
- [Koreeda] See you later.

159
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,357
[Koreeda] Mr. Mikami,
do you have a moment?

160
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,458
What is it?

161
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:44,630
Well... It's about Kanzaki.

162
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,368
- [Koreeda] I think he needs some support.
- [Mikami] Support?

163
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,072
[Koreeda] It's a crucial time for him.
It seems like he feels concerned.

164
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,512
[Mikami] Crucial time?
Oh, because of exams?

165
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,981
Isn't that a strange way of thinking?

166
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,082
[Koreeda] Huh?

167
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,985
Because there's never a time
in life that isn't important...

168
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,090
Let me tell you a story.

169
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,628
Every time a new season of
a certain famous school drama airs

170
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,597
schools all over Japan fall into chaos,
leading to classroom breakdown.

171
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,133
Wait, do you mean that drama?

172
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,804
Yes, that one.
The one you probably admired too.

173
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,876
What does that mean?

174
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,079
It created an atmosphere where
only super-passionate teachers

175
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,683
who dedicate themselves to students
are considered real educators.

176
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,320
Parents' demands on teachers escalated.

177
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,088
So ironically

178
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,224
the school drama that portrayed
the ideal vision of education

179
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,259
wound up becoming
a monster parent factory.

180
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,995
I never intended to be
a super-passionate teacher...

181
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,498
I admit, I did aspire to that a little.

182
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,270
For over 40 years,
that TV drama series has dictated

183
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,206
the image of a "good teacher."

184
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,942
Think about it.

185
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,312
There are about 250,000
high school teachers nationwide.

186
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,646
Which do you think is more realistic?

187
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,949
For all of them to become super-passionate

188
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:15,154
or for us to rethink the entire concept
of what makes a "good teacher"?

189
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,031
I never thought about it that way.

190
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,403
School and bureaucracies
are shockingly bound by precedent.

191
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,075
Education reform
cannot be achieved that way.

192
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,880
What education needs now
is not an upgrade, but a rebuild.

193
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,783
We must fundamentally
rethink and reconstruct existing...

194
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,019
systems and processes.

195
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,190
That said...

196
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,961
it's true that this moment
is significant for Kanzaki.

197
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,529
Huh?

198
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,199
The connection between
that murder case and Rintoku...

199
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,968
it's only a matter of time
before the media jumps on it.

200
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,643
We need to decide when to step in.

201
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,480
Or whether to step in at all.

202
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,650
That's a difficult question.

203
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,754
Let's think about it.

204

207
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,043
Hi, Takuto. Did you eat?

208
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,745
Yeah, I ate already.

TOKYO UNIVERSITY PREP COURSE, ENGLISH,
TSUTSUI NOW STREAMING

210
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,197
Hello, everyone.

211
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,833
I'm Tsutsui from Tokyo University
prep course's English department.

212
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:13,038
All right, let's get started
with page 23 of the textbook.

213
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,742
We'll begin by explaining question one.

214
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,612
[Mikami] Why was it the female teacher
who quit and not the male teacher?

215
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,982
[Tsutsui] You can solve the problem
without doing that.

216
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,151
Don't forget this.

217
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:30,089
Now, let's move on to question two.

218
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,693
Rearrange the given words
in the correct order...

219
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,700
I heard Mr. Mikami is doing
whatever he wants over there.

220
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,836
Huh? Where did you hear that?

221
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,871
My colleague's sister is in Rintoku.

222
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,040
Small world, huh?

223
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,875
You haven't been in touch?

224
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,410
You saw what happened, right?

225
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,412
You got your position
by selling me out, right?

226
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,913
So I should congratulate you.

227
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,518
I'm worried. I actually
like Mr. Mikami quite a bit.

228
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,587
Oh? In what way?

229
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,625
He seems cold at first,
but he's actually kind.

230
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,798
TWO YEARS AGO...

231
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,619
Hey.

232
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:41,994
Let me do that.

233
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,330
I can't. I have a Diet session tomorrow.

234
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,433
You missed the last train
again last night, didn't you?

235
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,301
Aren't you due soon? This is ridiculous.

236
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,438
But if something happens...

237
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,340
It's fine. Just go home.

238
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,844
Can you give me
just ten minutes for a briefing?

239
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,381
Sure.

240
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,086
[Makino] That's so unfair.

241
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,222
Pulling out the gentleman act
at just the right moment...

242
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,791
That's how he gets
everyone to fall for him.

243
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,861
Oh, by the way...

244
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,064
What's this?

245
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,668
You get to supervise Representative
Hasebe's grandson's homework.

246
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,206
Seriously? No, really, are you serious?

247
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,975
From Diet sessions
to a grandson's homework...

248
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,911
Anything related to education
and culture falls under our jurisdiction.

249
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,379
That's the Ministry of Education for you.

250
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,915
Oh, give me a break.

251
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,453
All right, one more task to go.

252
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,490
Man, I can't believe
we're saying that at this hour.

253
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,400
[Mizohata] Let's confirm this once more.

254
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,372
So, we can state that these claims
are completely unfounded, right?

255
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,242
Yes, as far as I can remember.

256
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,411
What's with that snarky phrasing?

257
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,081
Regardless, having an article
like this written by Kanzaki-kun

258
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,850
so soon after arriving
shows how careless you are.

259
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,954
Yes, I admit that was a lapse in judgment.

260
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,592
You sound like a bureaucrat.

261
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,329
[chuckles] Did I slip into
"Kasumigaseki Literature" again?

262
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,732
- Huh?
- Yes, it's a thing.

263
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:32,671
For example, "I do not recall,
so I have nothing further to say."

264
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,673
This isn't Kasumigaseki.

265
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,375
But it's convenient. Very flexible.

266
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,110
It can be interpreted in many ways.

267
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,747
It's the one and only literature crafted
by bureaucrats for bureaucrats.

268
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,850
I'll keep improving my skills.

269
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,159
[Koreeda] Good work today.

270
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,861
[students] Thank you very much.

271
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,962
See you tomorrow.

00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,533
I told you I have nothing to say.

275
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,236
I have something I need to ask.

276
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,073
I don't want to answer.
You understand that, right?

277
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,281
Please, just let me talk.

278
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,484
Please.

279
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,990
Not here.

280
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,094
Follow me, but keep your distance.

[thunder rumbles]

284
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,529
Here.

285
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,268
So what you wanted to talk about...
Is it her?

286
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,138
Huh?

287
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,974
You don't know?

288
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,744
About what?

289
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,415
Then why are you here?

290
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,053
It's because of my article, isn't it?

291
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,594
It's true that your article
in Rintoku Newspaper changed my life.

292
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,531
I got divorced. I quit my job.

293
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:26,271
But all you did was add the final drop
to an already overflowing cup.

294
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,274
I can't have you feeling responsible.

295
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,077
You're just saying that
to protect me, aren't you?

296
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,845
- No.
- That's a lie.

297
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,147
Don't assume things.

298
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,216
But...

299
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,018
That's all I can say.

300
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,421
And that's all I want to say.

301
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,426
That's not enough for me.

302
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,796
I don't live to satisfy your curiosity.

303
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:03,141
No matter what happens from now on,
it's not your fault.

304
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,879
Don't ever come here again.

[Kanzaki] You were following me?

I knew Ms. Saejima was working there.

But don't worry. I didn't
hear your conversation.

I'm responsible too.

312

I'm very sorry. We kindly ask
you to refrain from interviewing.

Former Rintoku Academy teacher,
Yuko Saejima.

She's the mother of Yuzuru Mayama,

325
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,321
[Mizohata] Please direct all inquiries
to the school's PR office.

326
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,491
And please refrain from
directly interviewing students.

327
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,261
[reporter 1] Is it true she resigned
because a student exposed her affair?

328
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,564
[reporter 2] Wasn't that the real
reason behind the case?

- [reporter 3] PR representative...
- [Mizohata] Please leave. Please...

332
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,615
[reporter 4] Give us a proper statement!

- What happened?
- I'll explain later.

I figured the thing about Ms. Saejima
would come out sooner or later

about the school newspaper

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,803
Chairman. What will you do
about tonight's TV appearance?

351
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,073
At a time like this? Cancel it.

352
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,242
That would be the best decision,
right, Chairman?

353
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,343
No.

354
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,814
- Stick to the original plan.
- Huh?

355
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,984
It would be strange to cancel
if we have nothing to hide.

356
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,719
As expected.

357
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,022
I'll inform the station
that we'll proceed as planned.

358
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,497
[operatic music playing]

359
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,171
Are you going to explain this
to the students now?

360
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,740
Yes, I suppose so.

361
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:14,245
Will you just say,
"There's nothing more we can disclose"?

362
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,413
Yes.

363
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,782
Shall I go with Nagatacho-style
statements this time?

364
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,820
- Huh?
- "It is truly regrettable."

365
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,190
Now, if you'll excuse me.

366
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,967
Is it true?
Their last names are different.

367
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,436
It seems she used
her maiden name for work.

368
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,604
I see.

369
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,607
[girl 1] It's already on online news.

370
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,211
[girl 2] They don't even bother
verifying things before publishing.

371
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,616
- [Mikami] Good morning.
- Good morning.

372
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,060
We will explain the commotion
at the school gate.

373
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,229
This involves events that
happened before I was assigned here.

374
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,497
That's why Ms. Koreeda is also present.

375
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,568
- Would you mind explaining?
- Okay.

376
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,807
Recently, there was a murder
at a civil service exam site.

377
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,777
The suspect arrested at the scene
is the child of Ms. Saejima

378
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,547
who resigned from Rintoku last year.

379
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,883
[indistinct chatter]

380
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,986
[Koreeda] The school is firmly
refusing any interviews

381
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,955
but reporters may continue
coming for a while.

382
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,926
Please remain calm
and handle the situation carefully.

383
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,196
If they follow you or come to your house

384
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,931
contact the school immediately.

385
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,466
[Wakui] May I ask something?

386
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,534
Go ahead.

387
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,372
What you mentioned
applies to regular classes.

388
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,073
[Koreeda] Well...

389
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,177
Our class has been together
since our junior year.

390
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,581
We're the same group as when
Kanzaki published his article.

391
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:02,687
If Kanzaki's article indirectly
led to the murder, just saying

392
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,124
"Be careful" isn't enough.

393
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,394
Wouldn't it be better
for the whole class to discuss it?

394
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,368
- You have a point. Shall we?
- Huh?

395
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,637
- [Sakurai] Excuse me...
- Yes?

396
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,640
Ever since the new term started, I haven't
been able to focus on studying at all.

397
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,776
It's been a huge inconvenience.

398
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,244
That's all.

399
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,680
Sakurai, that was a bit harsh.

400
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,649
Was it? It's the truth.

401
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,953
Ignoring it only made the problem worse.

402
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,356
If we ignore it again, won't it
just get even harder to focus?

403
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,794
[Sakurai] Do you even have
the right to say that?

404
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,663
[Mikami] Sakurai-san, you want
to become a lawyer, right?

405
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,265
Huh?

406
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,868
Would you say in court,
"You're a criminal, so shut up"?

407
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:57,075
And as far as I know,
all the professions you're aiming for

408
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,611
require focus no matter the situation.

409
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,789
All right, let's start.

410
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,036
How did you actually feel about that
newspaper article at the time?

411
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,313
Honestly, I found it kind of satisfying.

412
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,683
I thought it was outrageous
for teachers to have an affair.

413
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:44,255
To be honest, I also thought,
"Good job, Kanzaki"

414
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,028
So I don't think this incident
is entirely Kanzaki's fault.

415
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,664
I see. Anyone else?

416
00:33:56,067 --> 00:34:00,705
I couldn't believe Ms. Saejima
would do something like that.

417
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,408
It made me uneasy.

418
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,782
Go ahead.

419
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:16,921
I thought it was like those
citizen-arrest YouTubers.

420
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,223
I can see that.

421
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,526
Wait, citizen arrest?

422
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,195
There's a law that allows

423
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,231
regular people to make arrests
if they catch someone in the act.

424
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,035
But some people do it
just to post videos online.

425
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:37,708
The way Ms. Saejima was judged
one-sidedly reminded me of that.

426
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:44,449
But aren't you afraid the discussion
we're having now is the same thing?

427
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,017
That's...

428
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,054
Yeah, I get what you mean.

429
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,223
Talking about it while
Kanzaki is right here...

430
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,792
So, would it be better to
talk about it without him?

431
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,399
That would be even worse.

432
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,903
Kanzaki, what do you think?

433
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:16,013
No matter what happens
from now on, it's not your fault.

434
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,751
Nothing.

435
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,955
[shocked, indistinct chatter]

436
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,494
Do you really mean that? "Nothing"?

437
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,697
You don't actually think that, do you?

438
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,471
If it were me, in a moment like this,
I wouldn't know what to say.

439
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,412
Can I say something?

440
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,088
This photo is called
"The Vulture and the Little Girl."

441
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,190
It's famous for being one of

442
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,626
the ultimate ethical dilemmas
in journalism.

443
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,328
It was taken in Sudan

444
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,264
a country suffering from
poverty after a long civil war.

445
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:12,870
The photo won a major award,
but it also faced intense criticism.

446
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,773
People asked,
"Shouldn't the photographer have helped

447
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:20,578
the child instead of
just taking the picture?"

448
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,149
Do you know what happened afterward?

449
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:34,859
The child was later taken
to a food center and survived.

450
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,963
But the photographer,
who was criticized relentlessly

451
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,600
fell into depression
and took his own life.

452
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,570
I'm impressed.

453
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,140
I grew up in a house where that photo
was hanging in the living room.

454
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,243
[Mikami] Would you have taken the picture?

455
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,344
I would.

456
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,179
No hesitation.

457
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,882
I...

458
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,652
I wouldn't die over something like that.

459
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,490
You shouldn't overestimate yourself.

460
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,163
[indistinct chatter]

461
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,598
Takashi, it's really bad!

462
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,905
[chatter mutes, footsteps echo]

463
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,912
Now, I asked all of you this before.

464
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,549
"Why was it the female teacher
who was forced to resign

465
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,684
and not the male teacher?"

466
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,121
- Ms. Koreeda
- Yes?

467
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,090
When the current seniors were juniors

468
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,093
you were the only female
homeroom teacher, right?

469
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,662
That's correct.

470
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,065
Don't you think that's why
you were replaced by me?

471
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,236
I do.

472
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,106
[Mikami] If they needed a sacrificial lamb

473
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,041
they'd naturally pick the weaker one.

474
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,812
That's going too far.

475
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,415
So, can you say for sure that
the ones who made the decision

476
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,783
had no such bias?

477
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,791
And wasn't it the same for Ms. Saejima?

478
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:22,900
[camera clicks]

479
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,240
If Kevin Carter hadn't taken that photo

480
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,476
no one would have known
about the poverty going on there.

481
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,813
That's why I believe sometimes
you have to press the shutter.

482
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,422
But back then...

483
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,426
I didn't try to see...

484
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:55,266
the true identity of the vulture...

485
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,770
attacking Ms. Saejima.

486
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:12,116
So from now on...

487
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,758
I will catch it no matter what.

488
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,305
That'll be good.

489
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,776
See?

490
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:41,846
It wasn't "nothing" after all.

491
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,250
[gentle choral music playing]

492
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,389
[Mikami] Thank you.

493
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,998
That was a really meaningful discussion.

494
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,418
That took a while.

495
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,353
But it turned into a good discussion.

496
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:24,388
Huh?

497
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,725
He said he's going to catch the vulture.

498
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,594
- A vulture?
- Yes.

499
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:35,533
Animals that feed on rotting
flesh are called scavengers.

500
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,004
If dead animals are left alone,
diseases can spread.

501
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,442
Scavengers help to
prevent diseases from spreading.

502
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:49,513
But sometimes they also
erase evidence of slaughter.

503
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,359
That's it for today's lesson.

504
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,528
[indistinct chatter]

505
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,480
- Hey, Tominaga
- What?

506
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,348
There's something I want to talk about.

507
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,716
Can you spare some time?

508
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,817
Of course.

509
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,452
Sorry.

510
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,655
I actually love it when someone says,
"I have something I want to talk about."

511
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,823
So I'm so happy to listen.

512
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,331
What's up?

513
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,802
I came for this.
Though it pains me to admit it...

514
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:50,574
People like you who hate to lose
are exactly who I target my sales at.

515
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,454
[Koreeda] I tried to ignore it.

516
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,357
Ignore what?

517
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,394
My responsibility as
their homeroom teacher...

518
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,429
[assistant] Chairman Kodai is here.

519
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,899
[Kodai] Excuse me.

520
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:20,371
[Koreeda] Kanzaki's newspaper...
We let it slide under the excuse that

521
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,907
"students have the right to do this."

522
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,710
Because of that, Ms. Saejima
was forced to resign.

523
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,749
And when that incident happened,
all I worried about

524
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,619
was how Kanzaki-kun was feeling.

525
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,723
An innocent person had lost their life

526
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,928
but I didn't think I bore
any responsibility at all.

527
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:54,939
But Koreeda-chan,
you're taking action now, right?

528
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,513
Yeah, but this isn't enough.

529
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,650
The students were the ones
who started today's discussion.

530
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,519
Even if it isn't enough,
you can't just give up, right?

531
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,521
Both you and me.

532
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,023
Huh? You?

533
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,730
I always feel powerless.

534
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,367
There's only so much
a school nurse can do.

535
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,176
[sighs]

536
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:38,382
I guess I had no right to get upset
when he called me a slow loris.

537
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,783
What?

538
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,087
Oh, that cute little monkey?

539
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,188
Mm.

540
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,160
Teaching at such a prestigious school

541
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,999
it's easy to start believing
you're an exceptional teacher.

542
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,502
But in reality

543
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,940
I have no poison, no real weapons.

544
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:06,944
Then...

545
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,183
I just have to change myself
as much as I can.

546
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,788
That's true.

547
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,261
Let's do our best.

548
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:32,770
- I'll make some tea.
- Thank you.

549
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:38,242
[host 1] We'll be discussing the secret
to Rintoku Gakuin's success today.

550
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,846
[host 2] But first, may I talk about
the connection between the recent

551
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,950
murder at the civil service exam site
and Rintoku Academy?

552
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,422
[host 1] If you don't mind,
please go ahead.

553
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,658
Our school is not directly involved.

554
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,263
[Kodai] However, since the suspect's
mother was a former teacher at Rintoku

555
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,465
I was personally shocked.

556
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:05,669
That being said, I feel strong
resentment toward the media

557
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,604
for maliciously reporting that

558
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:12,409
she resigned because
of a student's newspaper.

559
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:19,049
We recognize it as a legitimate act
protected by freedom of speech.

560
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,819
Criticizing it could become
a human rights issue.

561
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,489
[host 1] Will there be any disciplinary
action against the students?

562
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,491
[Kodai] We never even considered it.

563
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:33,297
If anything, this proves that
the suspect's home environment

564
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,666
was far from ideal.

565
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,403
Crimes committed by young people
are often a reflection

566
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:43,440
of deeper societal issues.

567
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,611
Of course, this is just
my personal opinion.

568
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,581
[melancholy music playing]

569
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,218
[camera clicks]

570
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,452
What's wrong?

571
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,122
Nothing.

572
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,461
[camera clicks]

573
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,270
[Kodai] There's a phrase,
"The personal is political."

574
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,139
It means that individual
struggles are political issues.

575
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,878
I believe that the personal
circumstances of students

576
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:27,284
and teachers in education
should be considered

577
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,788
part of Japan's education system
as a whole.

578
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,858
So, even regarding this
difficult-to-define responsibility

579
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:40,197
I will continue to reflect on it
as an educator.

580
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,068
[host 1] Shall we move on
to the main topic?

581
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,439
Rintoku Gakuin, with its unique
education system, has risen to

582
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,410
the top ranks in Japan
for Tokyo University admissions.

583
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,979
[melancholy music swells]

584
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,452
TO TAKASHI MIKAMI

585
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,100
[keyboard clacking]

586
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,702
[man] I heard from Tsubuki

587
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,804
you and Mikami had
a pretty intense confrontation.

588
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,041
Yeah, we ran into each other
at our usual dinner.

589
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,876
It felt like a complete fallout.

590
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,812
[chuckles]
You should keep that connection.

591
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,314
You're not kids anymore.

592
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,084
- [hostess] Excuse me.
- [man] Yes?

593
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,920
Your guest has arrived.

594
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,021
Oh.

595
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,358
This is Makino.

596
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,261
Today, I wanted to introduce you
to Mr. Nakaoka.

597
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,096
I'm Makino.

598
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:48,599
I'm Nakaoka.

599
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,802
When I was younger

600
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,137
I worked as a policy secretary
for a certain politician.

601
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,341
Now, I run a small consulting firm.

602
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,743
[Mikano] I hear you have
incredible connections.

603
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,146
The man who bridges
Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho.

604
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,681
Some call you the "shadow matchmaker."

605
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,383
[chuckles]

606
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:09,386
Since Mikami isn't around

607
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,656
I'd like you to get along
with our shadow matchmaker instead.

608
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:18,395
Speaking of Mikami, I heard
he was sent to Rintoku Gakuin.

609
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:19,630
That's right.

610
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,599
It's the first ever bureaucratic dispatch
to a private high school.

611
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,670
Mr. Mikami was quite the handsome fellow

612
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,306
but you're on another level, Mr. Makino.

613
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,041
Oh my! [chuckling]

614
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,610
That kind of talk isn't in vogue anymore.

615
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,780
You mean "lookism"?

616
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,149
Of course, I'm aware of such terms.

617
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:45,022
But in Nagatachi,
appearances still matter quite a lot.

618
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,591
Just look at Mr. Tsukada.

619
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,359
[chuckles] My, oh my.

620
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,361
Well, Makino, you'd better

621
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,430
make sure the politicians
take a liking to you.

622
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:57,100
All right then, let's have a toast.

623
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,636
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

624
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,142
Ah!

625
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,912
Now then, enough small talk.

626
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,348
Since we haven't seen
each other in a while

627
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,584
a few requests have
piled up for you, Mr. Tsukada.

628
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,622
[chuckles] Come now!
The way you put it, you make me sound like

629
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,725
a cat-shaped robot that
can pull anything out of his pocket.

630
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,860
[Nakaoka] The biggest issue is Rintoku.

631
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:28,031
Ah. Let's not talk about that here.

632
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,503
My apologies.
Then let's just drink tonight.

633
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,604
[chuckles]

634
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:36,707
Let's do that.

635
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,712
- [hostess] Excuse me.
- Yes?

636
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:43,981
[man] Here they come.

637
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,315
Please make yourself comfortable.

638
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,884
- [Makino] Thank you.
- [man] That's right.

639
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,023
[Yamazoe] He's taking the morning off?

640
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,759
Mr. Mikami sure has a lot of freedom.

641
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,961
Being bureaucratic dispatch must be nice.

642
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,897
[Yamazoe] Maybe I should take
the afternoon off too.

643
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,608
Ms. Koreeda, do you know
why he took a half-day?

644
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:14,444
No.

645
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,617
[tense music playing]

646
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,259

GENERAL VISITATION

[Mikami] Yuzuru Mayama.

[footsteps approach]

[chair scrapes]

657
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:13,290
You're a bureaucrat, right?

658
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,459
[Mikami] That's right.

659
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,762
That's why I agree to meet you.

660
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,364
That's all.

661
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,508
Shall we talk about the person you killed?

662
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,713
Huh?

663
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,282
Yusuke Shibatani, 21 years old.

664
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,619
He was a junior in the University
of Tokyo Law Department.

665
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,289
He took the national
civil service exam in his junior year

666
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,559
so he could focus on the bar exam.

667
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,129
It was almost certain he would pass.

668
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:59,836
His actual test scores
were within the passing range.

669
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:03,440
- So he took it as a backup?
- You could say that.

670
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,810
His real goal was the bar exam after all.

671
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:16,019
I decided to kill the most
arrogant-looking person at the test site.

672
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:23,159
Guess my intuition wasn't wrong.

673
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,029
His parents divorced
when he was in middle school.

674
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,766
His mom raised him by herself and got him
all the way to the University of Tokyo.

675
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:35,238
It's easy to imagine that Yusuke Shibutani

676
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,008
was her everything.

677
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,684
- [students] Good morning.
- Good morning.

678
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,288
You're looking sharp as always.

679
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,822
Thank you very much.

680
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:58,328
[Mikami] And as far as I can see,
even with your life-risking actions

681
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,330
society hasn't changed at all.

682
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,501
The lawyer's chair that Yusuke
Shibutani was supposed to sit in

683
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,603
is now quietly empty.

684
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,774
Starting next year, there will be
stricter bag checks for exam takers.

685
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,075
That's about it.

686
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,079
Did you come here just to say
something so pointless?

687
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,447
Why did you kill him?

688
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,087
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

689
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:27,057
[tense music playing]

690
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,131
Do you need something?

691
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,170
Why was Ms. Saejima
the only one forced to resign?

692
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,512
Why do you need a reason so badly?

693
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,817
Kanzaki-kun, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

694
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:59,322
This academy was created
to nurture young people like you.

695
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,193
Independent thinkers
who can make their own judgments.

696
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:08,832
One has finally appeared.
It took 20 years. [chuckles]

697
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,800
I'm thrilled.

698
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,671
Was she fired because she was a woman?

699
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:20,377
We would never do something
so backward in this era.

700
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,147
[Mikami] Killing someone
in a place like that...

701
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,752
anyone but the most thickheaded
person would take that as a message.

702
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,991
[Kodai] I offered both of them a transfer
to the Rintoku Seminar.

703
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,595
It was Ms. Saejima's decision to refuse.

704
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,264
[Kodai] That's unfortunate.

705
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,768
That's a lie.

706
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:47,070
[tense music playing]

707
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,412
If that's what you think,
why not investigate it yourself?

708
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,941
[chair scrapes]

709
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,984
Maybe it's terrorism?

710
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,955
Or perhaps...

711
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,693
a revolution?

712
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,733
This world is distorted.

713
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,603
To destroy it, you need maximum impact.

714
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,140
Am I wrong?

715
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:08,184
A long time ago...
someone said the exact same thing.

716
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,189
I want to correct what's wrong.

717
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,059
And to do that...

718
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,431
I have to destroy it first.

719
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:27,103
What?

720
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,875
That person was important to me.

721
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:00,203
Are you afraid Kanzaki
will be the next victim?

722
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,005
[Mikami] Why did you think
killing just one person

723
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,307
- would be enough to change society?
- Don't compare me to those people!

724
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,210
Why did you come to this school?
For revenge? Or...
