1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,240
The fingerprint test results from the gun
that killed Ms. Lee have been released.

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Do the police know
whose fingerprints they are?

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,280
Watch out!

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
Stay away from me

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,800
if you don't want to be
the third corpse in this house.

6
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,640
Don't ever think of ditching me

7
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,040
because I have plenty
of evidence of your treachery.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
What should we do now?

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
You have to do it yourself.
We can't trust anyone else.

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,040
I bought an Unadon for you,
from your favorite shop.

11
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
Good, I'm hungry.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,320
PARIT

13
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
Yes, Parit?

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,200
I think Ms. Mon has been poisoned, Dao.

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
She's in a coma and hasn't woken up.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
So where are you now?

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
At the condo.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
That's a relief.

19
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,440
With Puwin.

20
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
Huh?

21
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,640
Dao. He might be the one
who poisoned Nichamon.

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,920
Don't eat anything
he bought for you, just to be safe.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,520
The meal's ready.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,120
I have to go, Parit.

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,840
Dao. You have to be more careful, alright?

26
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,800
- Who was that?
- My mom.

27
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,280
Did you hang up?

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,480
I have something to talk to her about too.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,920
What is it?

30
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,720
Well, I want to ask for her help

31
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,400
in finding an auspicious date
for our wedding.

32
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,720
Wedding?

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

34
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,560
I now realize that I should settle down.

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,880
Our plans have succeeded.

36
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,960
Even though
some things didn't go as expected,

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,400
but it's already good enough.

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
I was…

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,440
a greedy man.

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
Miss Dao.

41
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,160
Please forgive me.

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,680
I'll stop all of my plans

43
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,760
to have a happy life with you.

44
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,440
Will you marry me?

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,960
Why are you making that face?

46
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,240
You don't need to answer it now.

47
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,240
You can think about it.

48
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Let's eat.

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll feed you.

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Miang. How's Ms. Mon?

51
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,920
She has been transferred to the ICU.
It must be serious.

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,080
What about Dao?

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
She's at her condo,
but Puwin is also there.

54
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,560
And have you warned her?

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,000
I have, but…

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,520
It's alarming.
I want to just go to her condo now.

57
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,840
Then go ahead. I'll keep a lookout here.

58
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay. Let's keep each other posted.

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh, Buddha. I've sinned.

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,600
I did it because I was consumed by greed.

61
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
I swear that

62
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll make merits
with the money I'll be getting.

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
Sathu.

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Please don't let the police find out
that I'm the one who poisoned the food.

65
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,320
Sathu. Sathu.

66
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,040
Did the Buddha just grant my wish?

67
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh, that's not it?

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
Who is it?

69
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
The police.

70
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Oh, Buddha.

71
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,360
Did you misunderstand something?
No, this isn't what I wished for.

72
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,240
On second thoughts,
I’m more in the mood for coffee.

73
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,640
I'll just have it then.

74
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,880
What was he planning to do?

75
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Hello, Mom.

76
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>Dao. Dao. Dao.</i>

77
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,520
- <i>Help me, Dao.</i>
- What happened? Why are you crying?

78
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,200
I don't want to go to jail.
The police are here to arrest me.

79
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
Why are they arresting you?
What did you do?

80
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,760
Help me, Dao. I don't want to go

81
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,000
to the police station. I don't want

82
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,080
to go to jail. Help me!

83
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,200
I can't understand you
if you keep yelling like this.

84
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,880
Alright, I'll call the lawyer.
Go with the police for now,

85
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,240
but don't say anything
until the lawyer is there.

86
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,280
Dao!

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
- Parit.
- Are you safe?

88
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
Yes.

89
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,560
Get rid of all the food,
snacks, or fruits he bought you.

90
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,840
He brought a rice bowl for me,
but I didn't eat it.

91
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,000
That's good.

92
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,400
But he ate it all by himself.

93
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,160
Sometimes I feel like
we're being too skeptical of Mr. Pu.

94
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
After everything that happened…

95
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,760
He said he'd stop everything,

96
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
and he asked me to marry him.

97
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,920
Dao.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't listen to him.
He's the mastermind behind everything.

99
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's talk later, Parit.
I have to go bail my mom out of prison.

100
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
Wait.

101
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
What happened?

102
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't know about any of that.

103
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,160
Do you know Miss Nichamon?

104
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,840
Superficially

105
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Then you know her.

106
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,520
Yes.

107
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,040
When was the last time you two met?

108
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,520
I can't remember the exact date.

109
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
I met her

110
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,720
at the house blessing ceremony
of someone we know.

111
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Did you two ever have any arguments?

112
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,920
It can happen sometimes among women.

113
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,240
And what were you doing
in front of her house this afternoon?

114
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,600
I wasn't there.

115
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,680
Why would I be there?

116
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,280
This is footage from the camera.

117
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
Was there CCTV?

118
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,400
Oh, it's from a dashcam
of a car parked on that street.

119
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,000
That's not me!

120
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,840
That woman is a lot fatter than me!

121
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,400
And does this car with this license plate

122
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,520
belong to you, Ms. Kanta?

123
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,120
She insulted me first.

124
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,880
I was furious,
so I put some croton powder in the food

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,080
that she was about to eat. That's all!

126
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,800
Are you sure it was just croton powder?

127
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,440
Of course!

128
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,440
And did you act alone,

129
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
or did anyone else
supplied anything to you?

130
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,320
But you have to promise me one thing.

131
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,600
If anything goes wrong,

132
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,880
don't mention me

133
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
or there will be no one
who can help Dao and you anymore.

134
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
There was no one else. I did it alone.

135
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,360
POLICE STATION FOR THE PUBLIC

136
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
- Dao!
- Mom.

137
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,240
Help me, Dao.

138
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
Help me.

139
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,800
What actually happened, Mom?

140
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,560
We should talk about this later, Miss Dao.

141
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,680
Someone forced you to do it, right?

142
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,240
Do you think
I'm that senile and easily manipulated?

143
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Why did you have to bring him here?

144
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,840
You should take your restroom break.
There will be more questioning.

145
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,240
Dao. You must bail me out.

146
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,480
- I don't want to be in prison.
- Okay, okay.

147
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,360
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll find a way to help you.

148
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,600
- Alright?
- Thank you.

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,680
She never thinks before acting.

150
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Will we be able to bail her out?

151
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,880
That will be nearly impossible.

152
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
If the evidence is quite clear like this,

153
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,800
please prepare the collateral for bail.

154
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,960
I'll contact you later.

155
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
This should take a long time.
Shall we grab something to eat?

156
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,280
Someone wants to talk to you.

157
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,320
Go on, Dao.

158
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
Go sit there.

159
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Alright?

160
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,320
Take a seat, Dao.

161
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,680
You should know me better than anyone.

162
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Even if I didn't pick you as my wife,

163
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,680
I would reward you generously

164
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,400
for everything you've done for me.

165
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,640
If it's so tortuous,
then don't push yourself.

166
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,360
It's time for you to rest.

167
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,880
ELEVATOR ENTRANCE

168
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,720
Have you been waiting long?

169
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,600
I needed to clear out my to-do list.

170
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
Oh, I just got here too.

171
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Pu, I think you should hide.
Those two don't want us to meet.

172
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,800
Right.

173
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
Oh, there's Aunt Ploy.

174
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,920
Ms. Ploy.

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,360
Did something happen?

176
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,000
There's a development
in Ms. Nichamon's case.

177
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,760
It was concluded that she'd been poisoned.

178
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,280
Ms. Kanta put cyanide in her food.

179
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,000
She intended to take her life.

180
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,120
I can't believe

181
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,840
Kanta would do something like that.

182
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,640
I heard Ms. Mon's mother
will press the matter to the fullest.

183
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,359
Of course. It's her only daughter.

184
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,839
The police also refused bail.

185
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,800
Ms. Kanta is now detained at the station.

186
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
I'm not sure what she told the police

187
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,680
that made them look for
more cyanide from the source.

188
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,839
They must be quite sure
that there was an accomplice.

189
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,960
Don't tell me it was Dao.

190
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,400
I admit

191
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,840
that Jomkwan was my first love.

192
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,240
We were about to get married

193
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,640
but Ms. Lee disrupted our ceremony,

194
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
so we had to break up.

195
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,240
Kwan then had a new boyfriend

196
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,120
and became pregnant by him.

197
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
Then she lied

198
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
and said that I'm the father.

199
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,600
You're lucky to have caught her first.

200
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,520
Yes.

201
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,040
As for Nichamon,

202
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,080
she came into my life when I had no one.

203
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
It was not love.

204
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
I was just…

205
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,360
looking for someone to fill the void.

206
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,320
But we'd better not talk about her.

207
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
She didn't deserve to end up like that.

208
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
And what about Dao?

209
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
I'd meet Miss Dao at events all the time.

210
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,200
So,

211
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,760
I flirted with her
only as a man who sees a beautiful woman.

212
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,720
Our relationship is shallow.

213
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
We didn't love each other
enough to go any further.

214
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,920
But after Waythus' death,

215
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,400
her mother kept trying
to match me with her.

216
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,720
Well,

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,080
I don't know
if you'll believe what I said.

218
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,160
But just having the chance
to be transparent with you

219
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,880
is good enough for me.

220
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,520
No matter how you see me now,

221
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,120
I'm okay with it all.

222
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,480
It's too bad
you have an appointment after this.

223
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Otherwise, we would have time
for dinner together.

224
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,600
I really can't say no to this.

225
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,200
It's a farewell dinner before Parit's mom
flies back to the States tomorrow.

226
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,880
Then Miss Dao
should be there as well, right?

227
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
She wouldn't miss it.

228
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,080
She loves her teacher more than anyone.

229
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
I can go by myself from here.

230
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm glad we were able to talk

231
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
and solve many questions in my mind.

232
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,640
Right.

233
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm a lot more relieved now too.

234
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,640
Let's have a meal together sometime.

235
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,600
Of course.

236
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,360
Then, please drive safely.

237
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Dao.

238
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,080
Where are you, Dao?

239
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm at your condo.

240
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,000
<i>I'm out here at a party.</i>

241
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,560
Will you come back late?
If not, I'll wait.

242
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,680
I'm not sure yet.

243
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,640
Then no need to hurry.

244
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
I'll just sit here for a while.

245
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,360
If you don't come back,
I'll just come to see you in the morning.

246
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,520
Okay.

247
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,680
See you tomorrow.

248
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,320
He might be caught in a trap
that Ms. Ploy has planned.

249
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,560
He must be hiding
the evidence in your condo.

250
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
Hmm.

251
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,120
Then you need to check
every corner of your room tonight.

252
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,480
If there is cyanide there, we can be sure

253
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,160
that he's planning to
get rid of you and pursue Aunt Ploy.

254
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,040
That way, you can work with us
without any doubts.

255
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,920
Let's get back inside.
We're here for a while.

256
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Let's go.

257
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,880
I think there's no need for us
to hurry back. Just let them talk.

258
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,600
We can take a walk for a bit, alright?

259
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
Will it be okay?

260
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,720
It's okay.

261
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,320
Let's go.

262
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,040
Dao is here.

263
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,640
I couldn't be happier

264
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,960
when I see you
at the table with everyone again

265
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
after all this time.

266
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,600
Tonight,

267
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,640
I'm seeing the light
shining from you, my little star, again.

268
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,440
Everything will be alright.

269
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll always be
a good support for you, my student.

270
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
Please wait for me, teacher.

271
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,800
When everything is sorted out here,

272
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,760
I'll see you there.

273
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,560
Right.

274
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
I'll be waiting for you.

275
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,040
SILPTHANAKUL HOUSE

276
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,160
Whoops. Be careful.

277
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Are you alright?

278
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,120
Give me.

279
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,520
Okay.

280
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,000
Parit. Miang. Come sit with me.

281
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,320
I've got something for you.

282
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,440
You brought it
all the way from the States?

283
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,920
Of course.

284
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,720
Before coming here,

285
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,120
I needed to carefully plan
what I was going to bring.

286
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,800
We're so far apart
and the trips are expensive

287
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,520
but I don't want my son to feel ashamed.

288
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
What is it really?

289
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,000
Here. It's a ring

290
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,120
for your future bride.

291
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
Thank you, Mom.

292
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,280
You want to have it now?

293
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,480
- Parit!
- What?

294
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,280
We're here now. No need to be shy.

295
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,160
Stop right there.

296
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,400
This one is for you.

297
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,400
I want you to wear them on
your wedding day and then they're yours.

298
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,600
Hmm?

299
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
Will it be okay, teacher?

300
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,000
Have them.

301
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,120
Thank you.

302
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,520
Whoa.

303
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
But if the groom isn't me,
I want them back.

304
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
If it's not you,
I'd rather not get married at all.

305
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
You two are so madly in love.

306
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,440
Hey.

307
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Can I ask one thing of you two?

308
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,040
Yes.

309
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,600
If you want to get married,

310
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,280
please do it at least six months from now.

311
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The flights are
really expensive, you know?

312
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,880
‪Mom!

313
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,960
- I thought it was something else.
- Got it.

314
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,960
You can also move in before we're married.

315
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,160
- Parit.
- Ow.

316
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,680
Come here. Give me a hug, you two.

317
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,920
Come on. Get in here.

318
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
Come. Let's hug.

319
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,280
I'm so happy for you two.

320
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,000
Love each other very much to make up
for the time you've missed each other

321
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,600
and waited for each other
for seven or eight years.

322
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,120
Yes, Mom.

323
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,560
Come here.

324
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,800
Are you Miss Darinkarn?

325
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,960
- Yes.
- We have a search warrant.

326
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,720
- Look everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,120
What happened, Dao?

328
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,120
I don't know. They suddenly came
with a search warrant for my condo.

329
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,480
Right here, Captain.

330
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,480
Please open the safe for us.

331
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,320
It's really here, Parit.

332
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,120
What should I do with it?
Should I pour it down the drain?

333
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,280
I don't know if the police
will have a way to detect it.

334
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
Then what do we do?

335
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,280
Let's go with this,

336
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,960
you should pour it in the public restroom

337
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,280
and dispose of the container
and the lid in the different bins.

338
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,520
Officer.

339
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,040
Can I report a crime here?

340
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,320
This man

341
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,320
tricked my mother into
poisoning Nichamon's food to kill her.

342
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,040
INQUIRY ROOM 1

343
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,920
What is your relationship with Mr. Puwin?

344
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
I'm his wife.

345
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,000
It's hard for me to say.
I don't want to be disrespectful.

346
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,600
So, she's someone
I sometimes go eat and hang out with.

347
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,480
Nothing serious.

348
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,240
So, you and Miss Darinkarn are not
living together as a married couple?

349
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
How should I put it?

350
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,720
Well, I'm there when she "needs" me.

351
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,960
We're not living together,

352
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,880
but visit each other all the time

353
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,640
at my condo or his.

354
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,160
Our relationship is a secret.

355
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,080
Should we take a break, Miss Dao?
You look stressed.

356
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,159
Why? I'm not stressed.
I'm just telling the truth.

357
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
Let's continue.

358
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,320
Why is your relationship a secret?

359
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,679
Because he already has a wife.

360
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,480
I'm single.

361
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,760
I've never registered
a marriage certificate with anyone.

362
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,760
You knew that he was already married,

363
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,040
and yet still decided to be with him?

364
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I knew about it
when I was already with him.

365
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,480
He's been fooling me all along.

366
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,520
I couldn't break up with him

367
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
because I was pregnant.

368
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,239
According to our intel on Miss Darinkarn,

369
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
we found that
she had just miscarried recently.

370
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,239
That was not my child.

371
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,480
I was pregnant with Mr. Puwin's child.

372
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,040
She tried to claim that I was the father

373
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,720
be she hasn't been dating only me.

374
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,800
I'll never accept that
until we have the DNA test result.

375
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
But…

376
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,560
now she has lost the baby.

377
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,040
Are you trying to say that

378
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,960
Miss Darinkarn is now upset with you?

379
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,440
Yes.

380
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,000
She accused me

381
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,120
to get me in deep trouble.

382
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,560
His wife is the reason I miscarried.

383
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Do you know Mr. Puwin's wife personally?

384
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,080
Of course.

385
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,800
It's Nichamon, who has been poisoned.

386
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,960
And why did Miss Darinkarn accuse you

387
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
of manipulating her mother

388
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
into poisoning Ms. Nichamon's food?

389
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,120
That's nonsense.

390
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,920
Nichamon is just
another woman who's interested in me.

391
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,880
Do you get what I'm saying?

392
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,680
These women
were constantly fighting over me.

393
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,000
And Ms. Kanta was trying
to get me to marry her daughter.

394
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,720
Perhaps these two were the ones
who planned to murder Nichamon.

395
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,760
That's why I tipped you off
to search her condo.

396
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,800
Is there anything else?

397
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,360
I have a lot of work to do.

398
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,520
INQUIRY ROOM

399
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,520
- Thank you very much.
- Right.

400
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,600
You should have consulted me
before saying anything.

401
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,320
I wanted you to listen and
to find the solution, not to interrupt me,

402
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,280
because I want to bring him to justice.

403
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,880
But with a statement like that,

404
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
this case will be harder for us.

405
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
If it's too hard for you, then back off

406
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,400
so I can find a new lawyer.

407
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,440
And withdraw the lawsuit
about my Dad's company before you go.

408
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,360
Officer.

409
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,080
Did he confess?

410
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,880
He denied every charge.

411
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,120
And you just released him like that?

412
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,400
Mr. Puwin was accused
without any evidence linked to him.

413
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,720
We have to investigate further
and find more evidence.

414
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,480
- But he--
- Thank you, officer.

415
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,640
It's our pleasure.

416
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,680
Please calm down, Miss Dao.
We should talk first.

417
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,600
You can leave for now. I'll go see my mom.

418
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,360
Dao.

419
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,080
When will you bail me out?
I don't want to be in here.

420
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,800
The police denied bail, Mom.

421
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,280
They'll probably transfer you elsewhere.

422
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,320
No, Dao.

423
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Please help me!

424
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,480
I don't want to be in prison.

425
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,200
Then why did you believe him?

426
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,200
You did it behind my back.

427
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,480
I was trying to help you.

428
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,320
Stop using me as an excuse.

429
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
I can see through you.

430
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,640
You did everything for your own benefit.

431
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,680
Their daughter is in a coma now.

432
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,040
The parents wouldn't back down so easily.

433
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,080
If you tell the police
who tricked you to do it,

434
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,480
you might not have to be in jail at all.

435
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,880
I'll talk to Nichamon's mother.

436
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,280
With an attractive amount of grief money,

437
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
we might be able to settle this.

438
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,080
If it weren't for me,

439
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,840
no one would be able to help you.

440
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,920
No one tricked me into doing it!

441
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,800
I hate her
because she insulted me and you!

442
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,240
I…

443
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,040
I just put croton powder in her food!

444
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
God!

445
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,400
Mom. You can just rot in jail then!

446
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,840
Dao!

447
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Dao. Help me! I don't want to be in here!

448
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,920
Dao!

449
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,920
Parit. Any update? Can you contact Dao?

450
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,640
I can't. Her phone is off.

451
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,000
If I didn't have my own informant,

452
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,160
we wouldn't be able
to know what Dao is up to.

453
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,000
If Miss Dao confessed like that,

454
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,320
wouldn't she also be admitting that she
was an accomplice in Ms. Panalee's murder?

455
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,600
It's inconclusive now, Chawee.
We need to know what she said first.

456
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,040
She must be so upset

457
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,160
to know that Pu was trying to frame her.

458
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,920
So she tried to drag him to justice too.

459
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,600
Will she be detained like her mother?

460
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm not that stupid.

461
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,160
Dao.

462
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,800
Why didn't you talk to me first?
We have so many skilled lawyers.

463
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,360
If I hadn't done that,

464
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
he wouldn't have been
put in the spotlight, would he?

465
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,200
Dao's right.

466
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,400
Pu always tricks women into doing his
bidding without getting his hands dirty.

467
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,880
He might have done something himself
but we don't have any proof of that.

468
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,080
And what did you tell the police?

469
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,360
I confessed that Pu threatened me

470
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,680
to order a dress identical to Aunt Ploy's

471
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,000
for Nichamon to wear it
and murder Panalee,

472
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
then frame Aunt Ploy for the murder.

473
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,240
Nichamon is now the key

474
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,040
to exposing his crimes.

475
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,440
He must not want her to recover.

476
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,840
If we can't bring Puwin to justice,

477
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,040
it's possible to misunderstand that

478
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,440
you were the one behind everything

479
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,800
because you hated me
and wanted to destroy my reputation.

480
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
Can I talk with Aunt Ploy alone?

481
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,400
Alright. The mom
and the daughter want to talk.

482
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,720
Let's have some dessert in the kitchen.

483
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,840
I made plenty of bananas in coconut milk.

484
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,240
Right. I'm hungry now.

485
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,640
Let's go, kids.

486
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,960
Mr. Pu.

487
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,560
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.

488
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,120
You can see her first.

489
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,440
And we should talk outside afterward.

490
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,680
Right.

491
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,600
Mon. I'm here now, girl.

492
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,520
You have to wake up again.

493
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,560
Be with me.

494
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,040
Mon.

495
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,320
- Thank you.
- Here.

496
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Parit.

497
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,840
I'm still worried about Ms. Mon.

498
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,320
I fear she'll be silenced.

499
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,840
But Nichamon shouldn't be underestimated.

500
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,600
She might have hidden
some evidence to protect herself.

501
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,360
They were together for a long time.

502
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,800
I think they can see through each other.

503
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,520
Should we go see Ms. Mon?

504
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,000
- Let's go.
- What about my desserts?

505
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,080
We'll eat in the car.

506
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,880
But you said you were hungry.

507
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,560
Miang will feed me while I drive.

508
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
‪Well.

509
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,920
I'll just eat it myself then.

510
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,920
I…

511
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,000
I wanted to bring flowers
and officially offer you an apology.

512
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,920
But I'm ashamed of myself.

513
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,040
It will look like I'm pretending again.

514
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,080
You don't have to say it anymore.

515
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,400
I understand everything now.

516
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm really sorry, Aunt Ploy,

517
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,360
that I chose to believe people
with ill intentions toward me

518
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,200
and…

519
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,600
that I was hell-bent on hating you.

520
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,000
Forget it.

521
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,960
Forget all of that.

522
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,680
We can start again.

523
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,440
I think…

524
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,240
it might be too late.

525
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,400
That's not true.

526
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,280
It's never too late.

527
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,320
We all make mistakes.

528
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,000
But the important thing

529
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,560
is to realize it and improve ourselves.

530
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,840
You're so strong, you know that?

531
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,800
Aran

532
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,000
would be so proud of you.

533
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,240
You are very brave

534
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,360
for telling everyone the truth

535
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,680
and trying to bring
the criminal to justice.

536
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,480
I'm so proud of you, you know?

537
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,600
You're the best.

538
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,920
Do you know that…

539
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,120
I've waited my entire life

540
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,680
for you to open up

541
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,360
and accept me?

542
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,920
And today is that day.

543
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,080
I'll wait for your return.

544
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,360
We'll be a happy family again.

545
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Now, Aran might be…

546
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,840
He might be watching us from somewhere

547
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,520
and smiling with contentment

548
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,800
without any worries.

549
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,560
If there's no sign of her recovery,

550
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,760
what do you think you'll do, Mother?

551
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,400
I don't want to think about that.

552
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,320
I think you need to.

553
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,200
If she requires a tracheotomy
and is unconscious forever,

554
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
would you be willing
to let her suffer like that?

555
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,960
I think I know what she would want

556
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,240
as well as you do.

557
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,800
She wouldn't want to be a burden to you.

558
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,040
Let's do it like this.

559
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,080
If there's any sign
of her being conscious,

560
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,160
please call me immediately.

561
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,120
No matter how late it is,
don't hesitate to do it.

562
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,840
Call me right away.

563
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,080
Do you understand?

564
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,760
Yes.

565
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,200
I'll leave now.

566
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,040
It's Miang, Ms. Mon.

567
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,320
I told your mother about this.

568
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,440
You should wake up and see her.

569
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,400
If you keep lying still like this,

570
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,960
she'll be even more worried.

571
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,560
I think she can hear you,

572
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,440
but she just can't respond.

573
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,680
But if someone keeps talking to her

574
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,560
and not letting her
lie still all the time,

575
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,920
her brain might recover faster.

576
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,360
Oh, is there anything

577
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,000
that she likes
or is particularly interested in?

578
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,080
Why don't you try
talking to her about that?

579
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,320
Did you tell the gardener
to water your plants?

580
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,440
If not, your hydrangeas will wilt.

581
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,560
Miang.

582
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,360
Can you talk more about the flowers?
Looks like she's trying to open her eyes.

583
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,440
The hydrangeas
at your house are so beautiful.

584
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,040
It would be a shame if they died.

585
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,560
Do you want me to water them for you?

586
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,040
Parit. Ms. Mon is squeezing my hand.

587
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,560
Keep talking, Miang.

588
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,960
Ms. Mon.

589
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,720
You want me
to water your plants for you, right?

590
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,520
Ms. Mon. Ms. Mon! Ms. Mon!

591
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,520
Nurse!

592
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,560
Here.

593
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,000
Ms. Nichamon. Ms. Nichamon.

594
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,760
Looks like Ms. Mon
was trying to tell you something.

595
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,400
Was it about hydrangeas?

596
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,120
When you were
talking about going to her house,

597
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,840
her reaction was so obvious.

598
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,320
Did she want me to go to her house?

599
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,360
COCKY JERK

600
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,720
That cocky jerk.

601
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,000
How can I be of service, Mr. Pu?

602
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,760
Are you interested in working for me
when Ms. Kanta is away?

603
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,040
If it pays well,
I wouldn't be picky about the employer.

604
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,640
Do you remember Parit and Miang?

605
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,840
It's fine. I'll send you pictures of them.

606
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,040
And what do you want me to do with them?

607
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,400
Just follow them

608
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,760
and keep me posted

609
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,720
on where they go and what they do.

610
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,560
Easy-peasy. When should I start?

611
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,960
Right now. They're at the hospital.

612
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,360
They'll probably leave in a bit.

613
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,600
Go there immediately.

614
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,720
Parit. Ms. Mon is probably
really worried about her flowers

615
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
since she loves them so much.

616
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,360
She has them in both her house
in Bangkok and her mother's.

617
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,120
Then let's go to her house tomorrow.

618
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,840
Right.

619
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,080
How about we go tonight?
I wouldn't be able to sleep if we didn't.

620
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,200
Someone followed us
all the way from the hospital.

621
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,520
Huh?

622
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,000
Don't look.
They might notice that you know.

623
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,560
They went straight to their house
from the hospital.

624
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,640
Nowhere else.

625
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,560
Okay.

626
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,840
Follow them again tomorrow.

627
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,640
Find a place to stay nearby.
I'll pay for you.

628
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,200
Did you tell the gardener
to water your plants?

629
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,320
If not, your hydrangeas will wilt.

630
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,920
The hydrangeas…

631
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,800
What was she trying to tell me?

632
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,000
HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

633
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,160
HYDRANGEA

634
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,560
SINCE HYDRANGEAS ARE ONE OF THE PLANTS…

635
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
HYDRANGEAS ARE GENERALLY WHITE IN COLOR…

636
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,680
IN ALKALINE SOIL, FLOWERS ARE
LIKELY TO BE PURPLE OR PINK.

637
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,960
<i>Why is this one a different color?</i>
<i>They're planted in the same soil,</i>

638
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,360
<i>and how would the acidity</i>
<i>be different for just this one?</i>

639
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,960
Don't let those two get away.
I don't care if they're dead or alive.

640
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,240
I have the evidence.

641
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,800
Don't tell me Dao will betray us again.

642
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,440
After all this time,
do you really think I don't know?

643
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,160
Then watch yourself,

644
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,480
you hag.

645
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,680
Miang!

646
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
