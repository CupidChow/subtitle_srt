1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,360
You saw Mr. Pu doing well

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,040
and want to change
your child's father now?

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
- Kwan?
- Who the hell is she?

4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,560
I'll tell everyone the truth
that the two of us

5
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
are together.

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,080
What are the police doing here?

7
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,760
Maybe there are some developments
on Ms. Panalee's murder.

8
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Will you give
Dad's company back to me now?

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
I won't.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
Why? Do you intend to take both my man

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,120
and my company for yourself?

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,520
I did everything for our family.

13
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,960
Ms. Ploy. Mr. Puwin is here.
Would you like him to leave now?

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
- Tell him to wait.
- Yes.

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
No need to have manners.

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
He brings trouble every time he's here.

17
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Ms. Ploy.

18
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,240
Please sit. What brings you here
so early in the morning?

19
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,920
There's a development in the case,

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,240
so I'm here
to inform you as quickly as possible

21
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,960
to make you feel better.

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,920
Please get on with it.

23
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,680
The investigation results
from the CCTV footage are in.

24
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,880
It's quite clear that…

25
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,960
you and the person who shot Ms. Lee

26
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,200
are two different people.

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,120
The experts commented that

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,240
the characteristics of that person
in the footage and yours

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
are different.

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,320
And about the dresses,

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,480
the color and
the overall design are very similar.

32
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
However, after a thorough investigation,

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,960
the experts discovered some discrepancies.

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
It's possible that the suspect

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,920
intended to dress similarly
to frame you for the murder.

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,600
Of course, since I didn't do it.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Is there anything else?

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,280
The fingerprint test results
from the gun that killed Ms. Lee…

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880
have been released too.

40
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
Do the police know
whose fingerprints they are?

41
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
Whose fingerprints they really are?

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,640
The fingerprints are smudged

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,520
and couldn't be identified.

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
- Are you scared?
- What the hell are you playing?

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Why did you go through my stuff?

46
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,760
Thank you for the good news.

47
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
<i>You were lucky this time.</i>

48
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,440
<i>Trying to frame me?</i>
<i>It's not going to be easy.</i>

49
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm moving to the condo.

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,360
Suit yourself.

51
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,760
Anything else you want to tell me?

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,680
Are you still upset with me?

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
I can explain everything.

54
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,040
Can we make some time for lunch together?

55
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,040
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>if Dao is willing to work with us.</i>

56
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,760
<i>Please don't let Puwin find out</i>
<i>that we know he's with Dao yet.</i>

57
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
Please pretend that you're into him.

58
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Just play along for now.

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Sort out the problems at your house,

60
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,600
and then let me know when and where.

61
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,480
Thank you so much, Ms. Ploy.

62
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,080
Is that all?

63
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes. I won't bother you anymore.

64
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
- Set up the table.
- Yes.

65
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,200
Where is it? It was here yesterday.

66
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,920
She's off the hook.

67
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,920
Who'll be the one that shot Panalee now?

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,680
It could only be the real murderer.

69
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't keep helping to conceal it,

70
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,000
or I'll also be linked to the case.

71
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,320
Did Nichamon know about this?

72
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
Were you really the one
who shot Ms. Lee like they said?

73
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,320
That's not true.

74
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,640
There must be
some kind of misunderstanding.

75
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,760
But Mr. Pu seemed so sure
that you were the one who shot Ms. Lee.

76
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,960
He also told Miss Dao

77
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,080
that he won't continue to protect you

78
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
because he might be linked to the case.

79
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Someone must have faked
the evidence that led him to believe it.

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,720
I didn't murder Ms. Lee, really.

81
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
I said I don't want to eat anything!

82
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,960
I said I…

83
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
It's me.

84
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Teacher…

85
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,200
That's enough.
You don't have to talk about it anymore.

86
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
Parit told me everything.

87
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,440
Let's try to fix
all the problems together.

88
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
You are desperate for love,

89
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,200
and people with ill intentions
exploit that weakness to manipulate you.

90
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,880
If we can hold him responsible,

91
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,240
you might be able
to avoid serious charges.

92
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,800
Dao. Listen to me.

93
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,240
Don't get yourself into more trouble.

94
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,960
Even if we don't see the light
at the end of the tunnel,

95
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,320
we can be the light ourselves.

96
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,320
If we can get through all of this

97
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,640
and you feel uncomfortable

98
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,920
to face everyone here,

99
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
you’re welcome to live with me in the USA.

100
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Go pursue a master's or even a PhD.

101
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,880
Go do anything.

102
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,600
I'll take care of everything for you.

103
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
I don't want you to go back yet.

104
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,840
Can't you stay here a bit longer?

105
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,680
What about my husband?

106
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I'm only here for a while
and he asks me to go back every day.

107
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,400
You're so lucky

108
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,200
to have found someone who loves you.

109
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,520
Dao. I really believe that

110
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,640
someday you'll find
the one for you as well.

111
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,120
I promise that I'll come visit every year.

112
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,040
Please keep your promise.

113
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,560
Don't let me wait
seven or eight years again.

114
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
I'll keep my word.

115
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,760
Parit is now settled here.

116
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,560
You'll have a way to contact me.

117
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Watch out!

118
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,960
Dao! Dao! Are you okay?

119
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,360
Dao. Hang in there.

120
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,720
Dao!

121
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,960
Mom. How's Dao?

122
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,520
I'm waiting for the doctor.

123
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,120
Did a motorcycle taxi in the alley do it?

124
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,000
I couldn't see properly,

125
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
but there was no orange vest.

126
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,920
After hitting Dao,
he rode off immediately.

127
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
Did you two walk on the street?

128
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,360
We were right next to the curb.

129
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,360
Mom.

130
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,280
Do you think it looked like
he was trying to run you over?

131
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
But teacher had just come back.

132
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,160
She shouldn't have
any problems with anyone.

133
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,240
I think Dao was the target.

134
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm sorry.

135
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,120
Did she miscarry?

136
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,240
Yes. I've done a pelvic examination,
and there's no need for uterine curettage.

137
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,720
But I recommend staying in the hospital
to monitor the condition.

138
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,680
Yes, doctor. Thank you so much.

139
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
Aunt Ploy will be here in a bit.
I'll go sort something out.

140
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
Where are you going?

141
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,120
Parit.

142
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,480
I'll go with him.

143
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
Someone's here to see you, sir.

144
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,120
Parit. Calm down.

145
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,200
What kind of person are you?

146
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,640
- What are you talking about?
- Don't act stupid!

147
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,000
- I'll call security.
- No need!

148
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,440
There must be a misunderstanding.

149
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,240
Will you let go of me?

150
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,560
Get off!

151
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,040
- Leave us.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,600
You sent someone to hurt Dao, didn't you?

153
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Are you crazy?

154
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
Why would I hurt a pregnant woman?

155
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,000
You want Miss Dao to miscarry,

156
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,560
so you won't have to take responsibility.

157
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,920
You make it sound like I got her pregnant.

158
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,000
She miscarried.

159
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,280
Wait.

160
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm confused now. What really happened?

161
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,560
Miss Dao walked Parit's mother home

162
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,839
and someone on a motorcycle ran her over.

163
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,720
Miss Dao pushed her out of the way,

164
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,880
so she was the one who got hit.

165
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,440
If anything happens to my mother,

166
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,599
I won’t let it go.

167
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,320
I assure you

168
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,880
that I have nothing to do with it.

169
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
If you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do about it.

170
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,400
Actually, both of you
should suspect those women

171
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,080
who are fighting to be my wife instead.

172
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
Give her my condolences.

173
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,480
Looks like he really didn't know about it.

174
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,040
Is it possible that Ms. Mon did it?

175
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,200
She might want revenge
after being betrayed by Miss Dao and Pu.

176
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,440
Why weren't you more careful?

177
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
Who would have known

178
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,040
that your daughter would push her away?

179
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,240
How was Dao? Was she injured?

180
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,360
I saw her fall down on the ground.

181
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,360
Oh my god!

182
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,080
<i>I barely hit her.</i>
<i>She won't see God from this.</i>

183
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,600
And didn't you tell me
she doesn't like her stepmother?

184
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Then why did she help her?

185
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,440
How did Ploysaeng look when you saw her?

186
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,040
It must have been the wrong person!

187
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Karma has finally
caught up to me, hasn't it?

188
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,840
How can things continue if Dao miscarries?

189
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
She'll be cast aside without her baby!

190
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,480
God. I'm stressed now.

191
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,880
I have to go now.

192
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,840
- Ms. Mon, welcome.
- Oh.

193
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Where's Mr. Pu? Isn't he home yet?

194
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,680
Not yet. He said he had some work to do

195
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,640
and let Ms. Kwan have dinner alone.

196
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
Was she supposed to eat with him?

197
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
What a bitch.

198
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,880
And did that
big-bellied bitch go to sleep?

199
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,160
She's outside. Someone called her
and she went out right away.

200
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Did you hear her conversation?

201
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,280
I heard it.

202
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,280
What about the voice
at the end of the line?

203
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,320
Was it a man or a woman?

204
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,520
It sounded like a man.

205
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,320
- Was it her lover?
- I'm not sure about that.

206
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,920
Did you hear where
they were going to meet?

207
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,120
It's her old workplace.

208
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,800
Old workplace?

209
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,560
<i>A convenience store</i>
<i>at the corner of the street.</i>

210
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,200
Kwan.

211
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,920
Are you asleep?

212
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,840
I'm not.

213
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
Can I talk to you inside?

214
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,440
You're home so late tonight.

215
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
Aren't you getting ready for bed yet?

216
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,480
I was about to. I dozed off for a bit.

217
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
Who really is the father of your baby?

218
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
Why are you asking that?

219
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,200
<i>Why are you here?</i>

220
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
I'll get caught.

221
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
I missed you and our child so much.

222
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't you want a better life for us?

223
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,720
I can't wait anymore.
It'll be months before our baby is born.

224
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,640
If you want him to have a good life,
you must be patient.

225
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
Thinking of us won't kill you.

226
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,160
But poverty won't help our son survive.

227
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,240
Then when can I see you and our son again?

228
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
Mr. Pu promised me

229
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,800
that he would give me a huge amount
of money as a birthing gift.

230
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
It's… I…

231
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,520
I don't want to hear anything!

232
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,520
I'm asking you only one question.

233
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,080
Do you love your new husband more than me?

234
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,840
I'm sorry.

235
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,360
I had to make up my mind.

236
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,160
- I…
- That's enough!

237
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
I don't want to hear it.

238
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,080
Do you realize

239
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,720
that you've made the wrong move?

240
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
You shouldn't have fooled me.

241
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,360
When you told me
you were having a hard time,

242
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,840
I was willing to help you with anything.

243
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,480
You've taken my kindness for granted.

244
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,640
I've worked hard

245
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
and faced many hardships.

246
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
I've done everything…

247
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,640
just to be with you again.

248
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,520
You were the only woman…

249
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,800
that I loved!

250
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,240
And I thought…

251
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,600
you would love me with all your heart too.

252
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,840
Don't touch me!

253
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't… touch me.

254
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
I'll just think

255
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,360
that I have everything I have now…

256
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,480
because of you.

257
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
Stay away from me…

258
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,880
if you don't want to be
the third corpse in this house.

259
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,080
Go!

260
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,120
Get out!

261
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,280
Go away!

262
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,160
Go away! Don't let me see your face again!

263
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
Get out of here! Go!

264
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,120
It was you, wasn't it?

265
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Yes.

266
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,000
It's my job
to protect my husband from your lies.

267
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't blame others
for exposing your ugly truth.

268
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,960
You should blame yourself
for your own disgusting plan.

269
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,120
You betrayed Mr. Pu's love

270
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
when he loves you more than anything.

271
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,440
Why don't you call your husband
to pick you up?

272
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,720
He'll be so happy,

273
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,880
since he missed you so much
he was about to die.

274
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,440
Where's teacher?

275
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,520
She is downstairs buying something.

276
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,680
Dao.

277
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm sorry for your loss.

278
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,680
It's good that the baby is gone.

279
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
Someone who wasn't
born out of love, like me,

280
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,120
shouldn't have been born
in the first place.

281
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,480
I really believe that.

282
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,920
No one wants them anyway.

283
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,120
They'll just be a burden for everyone.

284
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,640
No need to say it anymore.

285
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,360
You know

286
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
that I understand you, right?

287
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Hmm?

288
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,680
Aunt Ploy.

289
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,480
No need to say anything.

290
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,760
I…

291
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,400
Dao. How are you doing?

292
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
If you're done, leave her alone.

293
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,960
You're in the way.
We'll talk among our family.

294
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,640
I'll leave now.

295
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,400
Right.

296
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,680
She must be thrilled to see you miscarry,

297
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,240
so she can have Mr. Pu all to herself.

298
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,160
She doesn't even know who the father was.

299
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,440
What are you defending her for?

300
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,280
And how did you know that I was here?

301
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,640
I asked Chawee, that's how.

302
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,080
And why did you call her to ask about me?

303
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,920
I was just worried about you.

304
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,160
And how did you know I was in an accident?

305
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,840
I didn't even tell you.

306
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,520
What's with these questions.
Are you a lawyer?

307
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,280
You sent someone to hurt me, didn't you?

308
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,760
Why would I do that?

309
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,520
Then how did you know? Who told you?

310
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,640
Mom.

311
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
Ugh.

312
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,160
It was a mistake!

313
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,680
My guy thought the person
who was with you was Ploy.

314
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Mom! Isn't everything
messed up enough already?

315
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,680
Dao. I really did it for you.

316
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,520
I care about you.

317
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,440
I intend to help you get rid of

318
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,080
all of Mr. Pu's women.

319
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,320
- I…
- Mom! That's enough!

320
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't ever do anything
behind my back again.

321
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,280
I'm sorry.

322
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,720
I didn't mean to hurt you.

323
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,960
Your child was also my grandchild.

324
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,960
I'm no less upset than you are.

325
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
You can leave.

326
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,960
I want to get some sleep.

327
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,440
What are you doing here?

328
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
It's our bedroom, so I'm going to bed.

329
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,880
It's time for the lady of the house
to claim her position.

330
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,280
Since Mr. CEO is so charming,

331
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,200
there will be
more women trying to have him.

332
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,200
Don't ever think of ditching me

333
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,680
because I have plenty
of evidence of your treachery.

334
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,320
If I got arrested,
you wouldn't survive either.

335
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,440
Whether you want to
have a good life together

336
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,760
or be in prison all our lives,

337
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,240
it's your decision.

338
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,440
She could lose
both her man and her company.

339
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Darn it.

340
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,880
Is my life going to be hard
towards the end?

341
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,560
Hello, Mr. Pu.

342
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,440
Did you know what happened to Dao?

343
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,920
No one wanted that to happen.

344
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,480
Well…

345
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
She's feeling better.

346
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,600
I heard she can go home tomorrow
in the afternoon if everything is fine.

347
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,800
I'm calling because I need your help
with something, ma'am.

348
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
<i>What do you need me to do, Mr. Pu?</i>

349
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,160
You can tell me. No need to be shy.

350
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,600
Nichamon is about to move into my house

351
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,360
and I don't like it.

352
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,360
I don't like it either!

353
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,640
Do you want me to just yell at her?

354
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,440
It's my specialty.

355
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,440
That wouldn't be enough, I don't think.

356
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,440
After she moves in,
I probably won't be able to kick her out.

357
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
That's right.

358
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,640
I've prepared
the bride's family gifts for you too.

359
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,840
There's land, and also cash

360
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,600
to repay you for raising Dao.

361
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,400
You were going to give me

362
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,800
the land and money?

363
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,440
Yes.

364
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,040
What should we do now?

365
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,440
I actually thought of something

366
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,800
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

367
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,080
What is it?

368
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,400
You have to do it yourself.

369
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,320
We can't trust anyone else

370
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,160
including Bomb.

371
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,320
I'd do anything for you

372
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,640
if you promise that you'll marry Dao

373
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,240
and stop pursuing Ploysaeng.

374
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,560
For your peace of mind,

375
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,600
I can give all the gifts to you in advance
after the work is done.

376
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,360
When would you like me to do it?

377
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,680
But Mr. Pu seemed so sure
that you're the one who shot Ms. Lee dead.

378
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,960
He also told Miss Dao

379
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,560
that he won't continue to protect you

380
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
because he might be linked to the case.

381
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,920
Where were you?

382
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,680
I couldn't sleep.

383
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,000
I was thinking about you.

384
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
What were you thinking about me?

385
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,520
Tomorrow,

386
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,440
why don't you go pack up your things

387
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,680
and move them all here?

388
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,240
Really?

389
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,080
I gave you my word.

390
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,280
I'll send the company's truck over
to help move your stuff tomorrow.

391
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,120
In the end, you're the only one
who truly loves me.

392
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,520
You've always been by my side

393
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,560
through thick

394
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,200
and thin, through hardships and happiness.

395
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
Thank you so much.

396
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,160
And…

397
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,080
aren't you mad at me
about Jomkwan anymore?

398
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
I should even thank you…

399
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,360
for opening my eyes.

400
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,400
What time do you think
you'll finish packing up,

401
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,800
so I can call the truck to your house?

402
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
I think around 1 p.m. is fine.

403
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,800
I want to have Aunty's food
for the last time.

404
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,960
For the last time?

405
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,480
What are you talking about?
You'll have other chances.

406
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,360
I said it correctly,

407
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,080
since I'll move
into this house permanently

408
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,800
and won't live there anymore.

409
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,480
Then, let's have dinner somewhere tonight.

410
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,000
Consider it a welcome dinner.

411
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,440
Sounds good.

412
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Drive safely.

413
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,640
How long will you be living at the condo?

414
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,680
Indefinitely.

415
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,960
Are you going to
visit Aunt Ploy sometimes?

416
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm not sure about that yet.

417
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,040
But I won't accept a monthly allowance
and dividend from her anymore

418
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,920
because they're not from Dad's company.

419
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,080
So how will you support yourself?

420
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,000
I'll find a job.

421
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,600
Miang doesn't have
as much as me and she's doing fine,

422
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,560
and why wouldn't I be alright?

423
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,240
If you can do it, I'm happy for you.

424
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,240
You can stop here.

425
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Thank teacher for me, for her advice.

426
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,720
I know how
I'm supposed to fix everything now.

427
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
What are you planning to do?

428
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,640
I can drive to the condo myself, Parit.

429
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,720
Thank you for helping me with my stuff.

430
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,120
Can I have my car key?

431
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,720
The delivery is here, Mr. Pu.

432
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,520
Yes, Mr. Pu?

433
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,640
I just sent the wardrobe designs for you
to choose. The ones here won't be enough.

434
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,120
I texted you the catalog.

435
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,280
Pick one right now,
so it can be delivered by the evening.

436
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,680
Alright.

437
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,760
My god. Why does it have to rain now,
of all times?

438
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,040
I like the first one,

439
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,840
but the third one
looks to be more practical

440
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,240
and can store a lot of stuff.

441
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,360
Do you prefer the looks
or the practicality?

442
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,440
Oh, which one should I pick?

443
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,000
I think I'll go with the practical one

444
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,280
<i>in case we get more clothes</i>
<i>and there's not enough storage.</i>

445
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,320
<i>Please tell them to deliver it right away.</i>

446
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,280
Okay, Mr. Pu. See you in a bit.

447
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,080
Yes, ma'am?

448
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,240
It's done, Mr. Pu.

449
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Okay.

450
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,040
Yes, Mr. Pu?

451
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,560
I've arrived.
The truck is ready in front of her house.

452
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,280
There's no one moving her stuff, right?

453
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,240
No, sir. But I saw a middle-aged woman

454
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,640
take the delivered food hung at the gate

455
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,920
and return it just a while later.

456
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,560
Seems like she might be a little off.

457
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,160
Was the dashcam able to record her?

458
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,280
Yes, it was.

459
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
Did someone get the food at the gate?

460
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,720
She came out to get it, sir.

461
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,640
Okay. Go park right in front of the house.

462
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,840
Someone will come out and ask
for your help moving stuff in a bit.

463
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,680
CALLS

464
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,920
MR. PU

465
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,600
NICHAMON

466
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,800
You shouldn't have
threatened me like that.

467
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,880
I won't allow everything
I've worked for all my life

468
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,840
to be ruined by you.

469
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,720
NICHAMON

470
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,920
Hello, Ms. Mon.

471
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
MIANG

472
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,480
Help me…

473
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,440
Ms. Mon, what happened?

474
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,600
Ms. Mon? Can you hear me?

475
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,280
Ms. Mon. Where are you now?

476
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Home…

477
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,000
<i>Ms. Mon.</i>

478
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,760
Ms. Mon!

479
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,640
There's an emergency.

480
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,120
Someone is unconscious, unknown cause.

481
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,840
The address is…

482
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,480
I can't bring myself to call her mother.
I don't know where to start.

483
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,920
I found it a bit strange.

484
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,360
Why did she call you instead of Puwin?

485
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,120
Yeah, why?

486
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,640
Or did she know he did it?

487
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,000
Is he planning to get rid of
the women one by one, except Aunt Ploy?

488
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
Jomkwan is out.

489
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,360
And now Ms. Mon is out.

490
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,040
Miss Dao is the only one left now.

491
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,880
I think we must warn Dao
to be more careful.

492
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,800
- Are you Ms. Nichamon's family?
- No, I just know her.

493
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,880
But I have her mother's number.

494
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,720
Can we have her mother's contact?

495
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,000
Right.

496
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,920
I brought some food for you.

497
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,200
Good, I'm hungry.

498
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,440
I bought an Unadon for you,
from your favorite shop.

499
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,720
I'll just get it out on the plates.

500
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,880
Thank you.

501
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,080
PARIT

502
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,720
Yes, Parit?

503
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,360
I think Ms. Mon has been poisoned, Dao.

504
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,440
She's in coma and hasn't woken up.

505
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,480
So where are you now?

506
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,480
At the condo.

507
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,640
That's a relief.

508
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,680
With Puwin.

509
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
Huh?

510
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,880
Dao. He might be the one
who poisoned Nichamon.

511
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,280
There's a development
in Ms. Nichamon's case.

512
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,320
They're quite sure
that there was an accomplice.

513
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,560
Don't tell me it was Dao.

514
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,480
I've waited my entire life

515
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,600
for you to open up

516
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,320
and accept me.

517
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,320
This man tricked my mother into
poisoning Nichamon's food to kill her.

518
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,120
You want me
to water your plants for you, right?

519
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,200
<i>Looks like Ms. Mon</i>
<i>is trying to tell you something.</i>

520
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,360
<i>Is it about Hydrangeas?</i>

521
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,760
Nichamon is now the key

522
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,720
<i>to exposing his crimes.</i>

523
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,560
<i>He must not want her to recover.</i>

524
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,440
