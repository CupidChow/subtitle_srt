1
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,680
- Dao!
- I'd like to stay like this for a while.

2
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,120
I'd even be happy
if you loved Miss Dao back

3
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
and it makes her…

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,720
Ma'am!

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Ma'am.

6
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Parit, I've found important evidence.

7
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,240
Put that cake down
and come home with me right now!

8
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,720
You brat!

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,080
You already know I despise Ploysaeng.

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,320
But it seems like you two are
really in love now. I won't allow it.

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
If I'm doing this for the land
to extend our market,

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,960
will it be worth allowing?

13
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
Please register at the lobby,

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
and then you can relax at your leisure.

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,760
The seminar will start around 3 p.m.

16
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
- Thank you very much.
- Right.

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
- Let's take a picture for Aunt Ploy.
- Yeah, let's do it.

18
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,520
One. Two.

19
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,320
- Okay. Is it good?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,760
- Okay.
- Is it alright?

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,120
- It is.
- Okay.

22
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll go ahead and register,
so we can check in to the rooms.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
- Please do it for me too.
- Of course. Be right back.

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
Are you going public
with your new boyfriend?

25
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,240
You can also hit on Aunt Ploy, can't you?

26
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you jealous?

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,320
We both are doing what we need to do.

28
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,600
For me, yes.
I’m sticking to the plan we made.

29
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,920
What about you and that Parit?

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm doing it to convince everyone,

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,320
so Aunt Ploy will really believe
that I've turned over a new leaf.

32
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,000
And she would open up to you more easily.

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,720
I'll try to believe this nonsense.

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320
Suit yourself. Don't let your pettiness
ruin our grand plan.

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,920
We've never loved each other anyway.

36
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
Let's go inside, Mom.

37
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,080
I'll go now, Mom.

38
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,800
What? Aren't you going to
sit down for a bit?

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
I have urgent work to do.

40
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,760
Don't forget
to take your medicine, alright?

41
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,160
I'll come and take you there again
around the appointment date.

42
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,080
Got it. Drive safely then.

43
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Right.

44
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
See you.

45
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800
- Good luck.
- Don't forget to take the medicine.

46
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,720
I know.

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
Oh. That's Mr. Patchek.

48
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
He's a rising businessman

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,240
who prospers at everything he does.
That's why Aunt Ploy wants his investment.

50
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
Ah.

51
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
He's alone now. Should we go talk to him?

52
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
Let's go.

53
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
Good morning, Mr. Patchek.

54
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,680
My name is Puwin, CEO of Tharnthong Group.

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
Nice to meet you.

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
How is Ms. Panalee doing?

57
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,400
She's doing well.
She still acts as my consultant.

58
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
Do you play golf?

59
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm not very good at it.

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Are you looking for someone
to play a round of golf with, sir?

61
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,520
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,160
We're from Camellia.

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
Parit here is the general manager,
and I'm Ms. Ploysaeng's daughter.

64
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,040
Ah.

65
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

66
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,520
Do you usually play golf?

67
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
Ah.

68
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,640
When I was working in the USA,
I played with the management all the time.

69
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,720
We still have a lot of time.
Do you have anything else to do?

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
Uh, Parit is free.

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,040
Yes.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
So, how about we go
stretch our muscles a bit?

73
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
Of course.

74
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,280
See you in the lobby in 15 minutes then.

75
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Right.

76
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Please go get changed in your room.
I'll prepare the equipment for you.

77
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay.

78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,600
Wasn't it too shameless?

79
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,040
I've just started working at Camellia,

80
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,880
so I'll need to achieve something
and impress Aunt Ploy.

81
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,800
Talk to you later.

82
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,600
Who is that?

83
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,480
Coming.

84
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Oh, dear.

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,360
It's me, Mon's neighbor.

87
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Right. I told you
my house was easy to find.

88
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,080
Next time you come,
no need to bring any gifts.

89
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,440
Too bad Mon has just left for Bangkok.

90
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
I missed her by just a moment.

91
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,360
Yes. Come on inside.

92
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
Come.

93
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,679
Come on in.

94
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,640
- Take a seat. I'll bring you some water.
- Thank you.

95
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,160
That's it.

96
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you looking at?

97
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,960
Then why didn't you go practice?!

98
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,840
It's a sport for executives. You should
have been able to play to socialize.

99
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,840
Why couldn't you think of
something this easy, Pu?!

100
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,240
<i>I'm being humiliated as well.</i>

101
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,640
You are the CEO, Pu.

102
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,800
How could you let
an assistant manager under probation

103
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,960
take your golden opportunity to
get close to a revered businessman away?!

104
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,400
<i>And about English too.</i>
<i>You're not good at it, are you?</i>

105
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,520
And what would you do
if there were foreign investors?!

106
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,200
That Parit has studied abroad too.

107
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,080
<i>They've got us. This is a disaster!</i>

108
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,920
Pu. Listen to me. From now on,

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,200
don't you do anything
that makes me lose to Ploysaeng!

110
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,480
Do you understand?!

111
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,680
This is the same photo.

112
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
Yes, I've seen it on your phone.

113
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,240
That's why it felt familiar.

114
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,800
But I just realized that Mon is married.

115
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
She's been married for a few years.

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
Really?

117
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,640
And her husband looks really good.
Is he from Bangkok?

118
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,280
But he's working abroad right now.

119
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,080
He comes home only a few times a year.

120
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
Really?

121
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,520
Hmm. And did they register
a marriage certificate together?

122
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,680
They didn't.
We had a small wedding with our family.

123
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,200
Anyway, do you want to see
the photos of their wedding day?

124
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,840
I do.

125
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,200
Wait a moment.

126
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
On the wedding day,

127
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,480
Mon was really beautiful.
Everyone said that about her.

128
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
You won't be able to trick Ms. Ploy.

129
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,600
- Enjoy.
- Yeah. Thank you very much.

130
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Thank you.

131
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,720
- Okay. Take your time.
- Please excuse me.

132
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,600
Why did you have to drag
Mr. Phiphop into that circle?

133
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,960
I have to achieve something too.

134
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,120
And who prevented you from being there?

135
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
You already know my English isn't good.

136
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
I haven't been studying abroad like him.

137
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,360
You're scared to talk to him
because he has blond hair?

138
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,560
He can speak fluent Thai
because he's been here for over ten years.

139
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,560
Why aren’t you as confident as usual?

140
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,960
Or are you losing self-esteem
because of someone more talented?

141
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,120
Don't worry. If he asks you in English,

142
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Parit would help you answer,

143
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,680
just like how he played golf
for you in the afternoon.

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,760
Are you planning to ditch me?

145
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,680
That won't be easy.

146
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,600
MIRIN

147
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,280
<i>Ms. Ploy, are you asleep?</i>

148
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
I was already asleep. What's the matter?

149
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,080
<i>Then, I won't keep you up.</i>

150
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,840
You've woken me up. Tell me what you want.

151
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,360
<i>I'd like to meet with you.</i>

152
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,760
I don't want to say it over the phone.

153
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you have any free time tomorrow?

154
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,480
I can do it in the afternoon.

155
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
That works.

156
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,960
And where do you prefer to meet?

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Yes, I remember. The coffee shop.

158
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,520
What time
should I be there to wait for you?

159
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,720
Right. Please get plenty of rest.
See you tomorrow.

160
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,960
You can't continue
to trick Ms. Ploy anymore.

161
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,760
I've only just started
and have many things to learn.

162
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,040
Mr. Patchek is actually my idol.

163
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,120
You honor me too much.

164
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,040
- I need to get this.
- Please feel free.

165
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,440
Please excuse me.

166
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,920
- Alright. Take your time.
- Please feel free.

167
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
You're welcome.

168
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,040
- Miss Namwan.
- Yes?

169
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,200
Have you seen Miss Dao?

170
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,440
I haven't seen her. I was just here.

171
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,400
It's okay. Wait. What about Mr. Parit,
a manager from Camellia?

172
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,680
I haven't seen him either.

173
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Alright.

174
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,560
Pathetic.

175
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,160
- Careful. Okay, one more step.
- Ooh.

176
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,560
One more. Careful. Okay.

177
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh, easy.

178
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,839
I told you not to drink that much.

179
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,119
Don't scold me, Parit.

180
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,520
I still want to be there.

181
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,119
Okay, okay.

182
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,599
Be careful right here. The steps are high.

183
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,680
Can I have your key card?

184
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,080
Yeah.

185
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,640
Be careful right here.
There's a step. Okay.

186
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,160
- I want you to stay with me.
- Okay, Hang on. Dao.

187
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Can you?

188
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,480
Hmm?

189
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,880
Wait here. Careful.

190
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,280
Take a seat.

191
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,440
Okay. Hold your balance, okay?
Don't fall asleep yet.

192
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,680
Okay.

193
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,320
Come. Easy there.

194
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,560
Stand up slowly. Easy.

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,120
Sit down. Slowly. Oh, Dao.

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,800
There's the pillow. Careful. Slowly.

197
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
Get some sleep now.
I'll wake you up tomorrow, okay?

198
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
Dao!

199
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
I won't let you go anywhere.

200
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
Dao. Let go of me.

201
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,720
Mr. Puwin. Mr. Puwin.

202
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,520
I've been looking for you everywhere.

203
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
I saw you talking to your friends,

204
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,120
so I didn't want to interrupt.

205
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,360
Mr. Pu. I want some more details about
the new mall project of Tharnthong Group.

206
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,720
But if you're tired, you can rest
and talk about it with me tomorrow.

207
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm not tired at all.
We can talk right now.

208
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,680
Then, let's get back to the ballroom.

209
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
Right.

210
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,560
Dao, let go.

211
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,720
I'm a man.

212
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,920
I can't be alone with you in the room.
It's inappropriate.

213
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,640
I don't care what anyone thinks.

214
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,800
Dao. Dao.

215
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,680
You're so drunk and not making any sense.
Let go of me.

216
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
Dao.

217
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
What a nuisance.

218
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,400
MIANG

219
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
POWER OFF

220
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,640
POWER OFF

221
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,680
I want my phone back, Dao.

222
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,760
If you want it, come get it.

223
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,800
Dao. Don't do this.

224
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,840
Dao. Give it to me!

225
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,120
Dao.

226
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,160
Did you just turn off your phone on me?

227
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,080
If I were someone else, you’d be getting
hundreds of texts and missed calls.

228
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,160
But I won't do it.
I'll just switch off the light and chill.

229
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,360
You turn off your phone? Alright.

230
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,920
Hey! Why are you attacking me?

231
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,480
Ungrateful bastard. I'll tell Ms. Ploy
that you've harassed Ms. Dao.

232
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Are you worried on behalf of Aunt Ploy?

233
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,880
Or are you jealous?

234
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,040
Do you want both
the daughter and the mother for yourself?

235
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,920
Watch your damn mouth.

236
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Stop!

237
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
What are you two doing?!

238
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,480
It's nothing. They're drunk.

239
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
Do you want to ruin
both companies' reputations?

240
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,840
Why don't you ask Mr. Puwin?
He started it.

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,400
Talk it out yourselves.

242
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
Seems like he knew about us.

243
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,960
No way.

244
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,160
You and I need to talk.

245
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,320
You didn't ask me to join you.

246
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
You were so drunk last night.
I didn't think you'd be up early.

247
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,520
I talked to Mr. Pu.

248
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
What happened last night,
we won’t talk about it.

249
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,280
And we'll act like nothing happened.

250
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,960
Are you sure it's true?

251
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes. The maid wouldn't lie to us.

252
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,560
It escalated into a fistfight?

253
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,000
They were fighting
right in front of Miss Dao's room.

254
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,760
But I don't know what they fought about.

255
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Miss Dao stopped them
at the end and they all dispersed.

256
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,320
I don't know if it was about Miss Dao.

257
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,400
How is that possible?
Pu isn't interested in her.

258
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,400
And were you able to get a hold of Puwin?
His phone is off and I couldn't reach him.

259
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,360
I asked the staff to call his room.

260
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
<i>Oh, the staff is here.</i>

261
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,080
Namwan, Mr. Puwin already checked out
earlier this morning.

262
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,080
Mr. Puwin checked out
earlier this morning.

263
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,320
What?

264
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,200
He just left
when the seminar is not even finished?

265
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,720
Thank you.

266
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,400
You're getting out of hand, Pu.

267
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
You're about to be exposed, playboy.

268
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Please take a seat, Ms. Ploy.

269
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I've been home for hours.
I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

270
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,880
<i>That's a relief. So I don't have to worry.</i>

271
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,880
Oh, tell your neighbor for me.

272
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,400
<i>If she comes to Phetchaburi again,</i>
<i>she can stop by my house anytime.</i>

273
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,760
Neighbor? Who?

274
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,000
She lied to my mom,
saying that she was my neighbor.

275
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,040
Not only did she sneak into my house
but she also went to my mom's house.

276
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,200
What did she do that for?

277
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,480
She told her she was visiting her,

278
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,520
but she actually went
to search for info about us.

279
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,480
And now she knows that we're married.

280
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,920
<i>She took photos of our wedding day too.</i>

281
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,120
She must be planning to expose us.

282
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,480
I'll be in trouble
if these two people know about this.

283
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,600
One is Ms. Lee, and another is Ms. Ploy.

284
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,240
What should we do, Mr. Pu?

285
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,840
Say something.

286
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,760
Let me think it through.

287
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I'll call you back.

288
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,000
This is Nichamon, the one who was fired.

289
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,520
- For arranging…
- I remember her.

290
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,360
Nichamon…

291
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,760
is my wife.

292
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,320
"Was" his wife.

293
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,280
Say it properly. It affects things.

294
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,240
Yes. We've separated.

295
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,680
It happened after what I did
that cost me my job.

296
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,440
We'd actually been fighting for a while,

297
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
so I decided to pull some stunts

298
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,160
to get him fired.

299
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,720
And what exactly did you want me
to come all the way here to talk about?

300
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,880
I don't understand.

301
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,880
If you see this set of photos from
someone with ill intentions anywhere,

302
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,960
please know that they're from our past.

303
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,200
Currently, we don't have
any ties to each other.

304
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,840
I'm afraid that it might be Ms. Lee's plan
to cause a misunderstanding between us,

305
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,000
so I brought Mon here
to confirm that we're divorced.

306
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,760
We're just friends.

307
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,040
We didn't part on good terms,

308
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,680
but I still don't want anyone to try to
bring him down with such a dirty tactic.

309
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,880
I didn't forget. I'm on my way.

310
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,560
I really want to know

311
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,000
who did this.

312
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,080
It must have been one of Ms. Lee's people.

313
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,160
Let's do it this way,
so I don't have to worry too much.

314
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,600
Quit your job and move back
with your mother for now.

315
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,840
That's good.

316
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,400
Hello.

317
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,240
How are you doing?

318
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm adjusting.

319
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,360
I asked Parit to give you the check.

320
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,120
I received it.

321
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
You already want to go home, don't you?

322
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,320
Yes.

323
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,640
But not right now.

324
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,920
I've got some evidence with me
and really want you to see for yourself.

325
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,520
Where did you get this photo?

326
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
It doesn't matter.

327
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,679
If you are going to accuse someone,
you should have more solid evidence.

328
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,520
They

329
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,560
separated after Nichamon hired someone
to disrupt the festival at Camellia.

330
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
They don't know it's you yet.

331
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,920
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

332
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,960
To catch someone in the act,
the evidence must be strong enough

333
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,360
to leave no openings
for them to take advantage of.

334
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,040
And if you want to expose someone again,

335
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,000
make sure the evidence you have is legit.

336
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,520
I can't keep protecting you every time.

337
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
Is that all you want with me?

338
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,560
How long have you known about this?

339
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,640
Let's just say I knew it before you did.

340
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,680
Anything else?

341
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,000
What a waste of time.

342
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,720
Thank you for taking good care of me.

343
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,880
Hmm.

344
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,120
I really want to go to seminars
with you again. I had such a good time.

345
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,240
But Aunt Ploy might be happier than we are

346
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,760
to know that Mr. Patchek wants to
discuss more with us at the office.

347
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,960
- Right.
- Uh.

348
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,560
I'll go home now.

349
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Bye.

350
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,320
A reward for my lovely brother.

351
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Uh…

352
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,080
Thank you.

353
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,040
We're going to need it for our long talk.

354
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you like to plant hydrangeas?

355
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,480
Uh-huh.

356
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,000
I knew it. Your mother's house
in Phetchaburi also has them.

357
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,280
So it was you.

358
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
What do you want?

359
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll be honest.

360
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
I happened to be interested in Mr. Puwin,

361
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
so I decided to do some background checks.

362
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,640
- You did it out of curiosity?
- Yes.

363
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,760
Are you afraid that I might expose you?

364
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,480
Or is your marriage to Mr. Pu

365
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,800
still a secret?

366
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,480
It's none of your business.

367
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Now that you know he has a wife,

368
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,600
what are you going to do?

369
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,800
I don’t want anything to do
with a womanizer like him,

370
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,720
since you’re not the only one he has.

371
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,680
What did you find out?

372
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,040
Mr. Pu's been courting Ms. Ploy, my boss.

373
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,320
He's hitting on the mother
while currently dating her daughter.

374
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,600
I just can't with a man like this.

375
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,960
Wait.

376
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,680
By the daughter, did you mean Miss Dao?

377
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,400
Who else could it be?

378
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,600
I planned to stay quiet about it
because it’s none of my business,

379
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,960
but I can’t help feeling bad for you.

380
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,040
Let's say that I won't tell anyone
that you two are married.

381
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,560
But you have to keep
our talk a secret as well.

382
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
That's all I have to say to you.

383
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,400
Good luck trying to
stick a perfect landing.

384
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,240
Wait.

385
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,000
I want to know more
about Mr. Pu and Miss Dao.

386
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,720
Why? Are you trying to catch
your cheating husband?

387
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
Will you help me?

388
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,440
Only a glass of water
might not be enough now.

389
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,120
Where have you been?
Why did you just come back?

390
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,480
I had to take care of some business.

391
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,840
What could be more important than
representing the company at the seminar?

392
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,120
It was for the company.

393
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
What was it?

394
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,360
Well, I had the chance to
speak with Mr. Phiphop personally

395
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,720
and found out that he's superstitious.

396
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
And?

397
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,800
Before investing with anyone, he likes
to bring the fortune of an executive

398
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,400
to Master Suea, the fortune teller
who he's close with, to check first.

399
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,120
So, I rushed back to Bangkok
to meet with Master Suea

400
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,400
and check my fortune, just to be safe.

401
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,520
And what did he say?

402
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Our fortune and his are
a perfect match for a business venture.

403
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,480
And whose fortune did you check?
Mine or yours?

404
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,400
I've checked both of our fortunes.
But mine and Mr. Phiphop's

405
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,400
complement each other better than yours.

406
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,160
Fortune tellers just guess.

407
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,680
Right. But if he likes these things,
we'll have to play along.

408
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,480
It's better than
losing him to Camellia too.

409
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
That's true.

410
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,480
So, I'm asking for your permission

411
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,600
to let the secretary send the appointment
letter to him using my name.

412
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
Get on with it.

413
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,960
Don't lose him to Camellia too.

414
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,560
Yes, Ms. Lee.

415
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,520
You're off the hook this time.

416
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,960
Next time you do anything,
report to me and don’t just disappear

417
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,440
Do you think you're the company owner?

418
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,400
I wouldn't dare to.

419
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,680
Good.

420
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,000
Keep in mind

421
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,720
that you are

422
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,240
merely my figurehead.

423
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,360
I'm always aware of

424
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,400
who has given me

425
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,640
everything I have today.

426
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,080
It's good that you are aware of it,

427
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,800
so I can be merciful to you
for a long time.

428
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,200
Yes, Ms. Lee.

429
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,680
Go do whatever you want.
I'll go to the party with my friends.

430
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,920
I'm in a good mood now.

431
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,680
Let me clear things up just a bit longer

432
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,760
and you'll have your long rest.

433
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,400
If they can anticipate my moves,
I'll have to change my game plan

434
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,880
by resorting to something basic

435
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,880
like a wife's wrath.

436
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,840
But I hope Nichamon
doesn't tell Mr. Pu right away.

437
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,440
I don't think she will.

438
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,400
Parit.

439
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,160
I think their marriage

440
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,920
must be top secret.

441
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,920
Because if Ms. Lee knew about it,
she'd speak of it in front of Ms. Ploy.

442
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,640
Hmm. That's true.

443
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,680
Mr. Pu must want to keep it from her and
Aunt Ploy, so he had to tell Aunt Ploy.

444
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,640
And what they said about being divorced

445
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,640
is likely an excuse.

446
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,080
And Ms. Ploy believed them?

447
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,280
It's hard to judge.

448
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,480
We don't know how deep
his relationship with Aunt Ploy is.

449
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,680
I hope we can expose
this womanizer in time.

450
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,960
Although you were forced to separate
from Waythus because he passed away,

451
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,680
I'll honor my promise to you.

452
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,880
This is the bankbook

453
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,760
for the fixed deposit account
that Aran opened in your name.

454
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,360
I'll return it to you today.

455
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,680
Thank you.

456
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,120
I haven’t made any investments in it
due to my fear of uncertainty.

457
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
So, it remained a fixed deposit account

458
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
and earned interest every year.

459
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,160
It's only 20 million?

460
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,640
But there’s interest
that has accumulated every year.

461
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,720
Just a blink of an eye,
and it’ll all be gone.

462
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,880
You can use it all up
in the blink of an eye

463
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,760
but Aran, your father,
had to work so hard for it.

464
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,080
He poured his heart and soul

465
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,920
into building the company until
it made a profit. It wasn't easy, Dao.

466
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,440
Then I'll invest to make it grow.

467
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,280
That's the right idea.

468
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,080
Think of it as having
a free 20-million investment fund.

469
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,000
Right.

470
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,040
So, I did what I promised.

471
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,080
What about Dad's company?
Aren't you giving it to me?

472
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,920
I don't think it's the right time.

473
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
You haven't profited
from it enough, have you?

474
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,120
How cunning of you
to give me just small change.

475
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,800
Here. Miang bought you
some Khanom mo kaeng.

476
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,160
Wow. Thank you.

477
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,120
Miang must know I like it.
Did she go to Phetchaburi?

478
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,280
- Yes.
- Ah.

479
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,520
But she wants you to eat it bit by bit,
so your blood sugar won’t skyrocket.

480
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,040
Don't worry about it.

481
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,480
It's good that you're here.
I have something to tell you.

482
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,880
Ms. Ploy has given Miss Dao
her inheritance.

483
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,680
Is that true?

484
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,800
Only the cash in the account.
She hasn't handed over the company to her.

485
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,160
And what did Dao say?

486
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,600
She wasn't really happy about it,
but she kept it to herself.

487
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,160
She actually wanted the company
because it makes a lot of profit.

488
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,120
The money that she's spending
extravagantly these days

489
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,760
is partly from the dividend
of her father's company.

490
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,760
Do you know what this company does?

491
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,120
It's a construction contracting company.

492
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,000
Do you remember the company name?

493
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,920
It's in English.
There are A and R in the name.

494
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,640
AR?

495
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,280
Does it stand for Aran?

496
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,760
That might be possible.

497
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,240
And from what they do,

498
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,280
does the name include "construction"?

499
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,760
Yes, yes. It's cons… tion.
Something like that. I can't pronounce it.

500
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,000
Right.

501
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,440
AR Construction?

502
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,440
And how can I find
anyone I can trust like you?

503
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,920
I'm worried about my mom.

504
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
I understand that you love your mom.

505
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,160
Let's do it this way.

506
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,640
When your mom gets better,
come back to work with me.

507
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,000
Of course, Ms. Lee.

508
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,160
Use it to take care of your mom.

509
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,840
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

510
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,200
Ms. Lee didn't question anything about us.

511
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,160
Then you don't have to hide
at your mother's house anymore.

512
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,600
Give it some time,
and then come back to work.

513
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,240
Got it.

514
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,360
Is Miss Dao ditching us?

515
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,200
She just got her inheritance anyway.
Why does she have to risk working with us?

516
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,760
She'd be better off
finding a new man to marry.

517
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,680
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

518
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,600
- How can I help you?
- Is this place AR Construction?

519
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,480
Yes. Are you here
to discuss a construction project?

520
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,800
Yes.

521
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,160
I'm so sorry.

522
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,040
Our schedule is really packed right now.

523
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,280
We can take on new clients again
next year, will you be able to wait?

524
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Next year? That's a long time to wait.

525
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,920
Yes.

526
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,320
Then, can I have your contact details

527
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,280
in case there's an opening
I can fit your project in?

528
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,720
- But I think it's not likely to happen.
- Right.

529
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,240
Then it's okay. I'm in quite a hurry.
Maybe next time

530
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

531
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,160
Who are you?!
What have you done to my mom?

532
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,800
I haven't done anything to her.
Your mom is upstairs.

533
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,800
- Why are you in here? I'll call the cops.
- Please wait.

534
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,240
What's the matter, Dao?

535
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,320
He's my friend.

536
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,560
Friend?

537
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,120
Well, my younger friend.

538
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,120
Go ahead if you have some place to be.
Come back later.

539
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,400
Yes.

540
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,640
Mom. Who is he?

541
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,520
I told you he's my friend!

542
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,600
More like your sleeping partner.

543
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,120
Hey. He can be my friend,
my partner, or my roommate.

544
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,000
It doesn't matter! Just let me be happy
in the remaining years of my life!

545
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,600
How annoying.
There are cougars everywhere I go.

546
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
So how many men do you have?

547
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,560
And did I poke my nose into your business?

548
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,520
Go ahead and tell me what you want.

549
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,120
Aunt Ploy returned the inheritance to me.

550
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,960
Really?

551
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,280
But not all of it.

552
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,080
What did she give back to you?

553
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,840
Just a savings account,
but not Dad's company.

554
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,240
How sly she is.

555
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,280
She knew that Aran's company
makes tons of profit.

556
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,560
I heard people say

557
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,880
that they make hundreds of millions.

558
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,520
Right.
That's why she hasn't given it to me.

559
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,560
This bitch.

560
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,040
And how much is
in the account she gave you?

561
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,360
Twenty million.

562
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,240
Twenty million?! Are you crazy?!

563
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,920
Huh?! Ploysaeng has
thousands of millions in her account!

564
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,640
She acted down to earth
and led you to believe

565
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,960
that she never expected
anything from you. But in reality,

566
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,080
she extorts money from your dad's
company every day. Don't you know?

567
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,440
This bitch is devious. That fortune

568
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,640
is your father's blood, sweat, and tears.

569
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,040
That's why
you need to take back all of it!

570
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,360
Mr. Pu and I have a plan.

571
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,840
I didn't actually want to go that far,

572
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,760
but she decided not to give it to me.
It can't be helped.

573
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,920
Come on. Are you sneaking in on me?

574
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,040
Face me. Take that.

575
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,520
- Come on in.
- Wow.

576
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,680
Ow. Whoa.

577
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,520
- Am I interrupting? You look busy.
- Ugh.

578
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,440
I'm dead. I have some time to talk.
Take a seat.

579
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,400
Let me play this game
to boost my energy for a bit.

580
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,600
I bet deadlines can do that too.

581
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,800
That hurts.

582
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,360
How can I help you, hotshot?

583
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,920
I have something to ask you about.

584
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,880
Go ahead and ask.

585
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,800
Is AR Construction our affiliate company?

586
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,360
AR Construction?

587
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,240
Not really. It's the company that
was passed on to Ms. Ploy by Mr. Aran.

588
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,600
How are their profits?

589
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,480
As far as I know,
they make a profit every year

590
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
but…

591
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,680
it’s rumored that they’re
using construction work as a front

592
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,280
and actually doing shady business.

593
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,640
What do you mean by shady?

594
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,000
Shady? It's not clearly legal
or illegal, but falls in the gray area.

595
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,040
Could you be more cryptic?

596
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,160
I still want to work here, man.

597
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,600
<i>Meet me at my room, 7 p.m.</i>

598
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,800
Dress beautifully.
I like well-dressed girls.

599
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,640
Thank you for looking out for me,

600
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,600
but I can take care of myself.

601
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Tell me right now who the father is!

602
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,520
Mr. Pu already has a wife.

603
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,360
What? You didn't know?

604
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,160
Ms. Ploy knew about this.

605
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,760
How did you do this to me?

606
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,160
Change of plan.

607
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,680
For Ms. Lee, you can do
whatever you want. Bye.

608
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,680
It won't be that easy.

609
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,680
