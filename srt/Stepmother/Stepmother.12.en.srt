1
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
- That's it.
- What are you looking at?

2
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,680
I've got some evidence with me and
really want you to see with your own eyes.

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll tell Ms. Ploy
that you harassed Ms. Dao.

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Do you want both
the daughter and the mother for yourself?

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,880
Watch your damn mouth.

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Mr. Pu's been courting Ms. Ploy, my boss.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,160
He's hitting on the mother
while currently dating her daughter.

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
I want to know more
about Mr. Pu and Miss Dao.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,160
Keep in mind

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,720
that you're merely my figurehead.

11
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,480
Let me clear things up just a bit longer

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,640
and you'll have your long rest.

13
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
I haven't seen you for weeks.

14
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
I thought you'd already moved out.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,520
I'll move out at the end of this month.

16
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,320
Why?

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
I ran out of money.

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
He dumped me. His wife caught us.

19
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm sorry for that.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
It would be nice
if you could give me some work

21
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,240
instead of saying sorry.

22
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
I found out

23
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,200
who took our wedding photos
and tried to expose us.

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
Who?

25
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,200
It was Miang, the girl Ms. Ploy took in.

26
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,960
I caught her in the act.

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
She went to your house again?

28
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Yes.

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,440
She wore a long-haired wig
and tried to look inside from the gate.

30
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
When I confronted her,
she confessed everything.

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
What does she want?

32
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,600
She's suddenly interested in you.

33
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,240
I don't know when she met you.

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,360
She saw me when I went to see you
at the condo, so she followed me.

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,440
But I lied to her,

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
saying that we were divorced.

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,800
Stop being too charismatic.

38
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,640
What are you talking about?

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
You already know

40
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,360
that I want only you.

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
I hope that’s true

42
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,880
So… what would you like to do?

43
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
I can do anything.

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm not picky.

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,880
If I'm happy about it, I can do it.

46
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,160
Meet me at my room at 7 p.m.

47
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,120
And we'll find out how I can help you.

48
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
Noted.

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,920
See you at seven o'clock.

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Dress beautifully.

51
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,400
I like well-dressed girls.

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,080
Right.

53
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,040
MIANG

54
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,240
Hello, Miang. I was about to call you.

55
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,680
Could you come to my condo?

56
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Why? Do you need something?

57
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm not sure what he really wants,

58
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,000
but I don't have a choice.

59
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,520
And we won't get this chance every day.

60
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Wait. Hold on.

61
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,720
I don't agree with this plan, Miang.
It's too risky.

62
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
That's why I want you here in my condo.

63
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,440
It's really rushed.
What if I'm not available?

64
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
Alright, listen to me.

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
Wait for me in your room.

66
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,480
If I'm not there in time,
you must not go and meet him, okay?

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,880
Let's talk when I'm there.

68
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay.

69
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
DAO

70
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Hello, Dao.

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,760
Are you almost home?
I'm waiting here to jog with you.

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
Sorry. I can't go anymore.
There's something urgent I must do.

73
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,720
You're going somewhere
with Miang, aren't you?

74
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
I can jog alone. I don't need you.

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
When I call you,
you have to go right away.

76
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,320
Do you have any other outfits?

77
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,680
Parit.

78
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,680
I thought you were
going to say I look beautiful.

79
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,159
You look beautiful.

80
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
But it's too revealing.

81
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,440
It's not too revealing.
It's just unfamiliar to you.

82
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,640
If you want to get a tiger cub,
you have to enter the tiger's den.

83
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,840
Oh, I fear you'll be eaten by the tiger.

84
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,400
Let him try.
I'd tell Ms. Ploy immediately.

85
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm sure she'd despise
a womanizer like him.

86
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,760
Uh-huh.

87
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,520
But if you're in there for too long,
I'll break into the room.

88
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Calm down, Parit.

89
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,560
I think he wouldn't dare to do anything.

90
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,960
At best, he might

91
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,400
negotiate something with me for a job.

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
It's time. I have to go.

93
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,960
- Miang.
- Yes?

94
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
Use your senses.

95
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
If it doesn't feel right,
call me immediately.

96
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
Right.

97
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
I'll go now.

98
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Be careful, Miang. I’m anxious about this.

99
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,480
You're acting
like I'm going to a battlefield.

100
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Time to go.

101
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
Did you come to the wrong room?

102
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Come on in.

103
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,200
You look so beautiful…

104
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,440
I almost couldn't recognize you.

105
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
I did it so I could impress you.

106
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,720
What do you want from me?

107
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,160
What can you give me?

108
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,960
Why are you being like this?

109
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Ms. Ploy.

110
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
We already have enough problems
between our companies.

111
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,800
I don't want to start a new one.

112
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,840
You're shameless.

113
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,280
You use your body,

114
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,880
instead of the skills
and experience you have.

115
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,520
You're misunderstanding me.

116
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,760
- He tricked me into coming here.
- Wait.

117
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,000
Who's the tricky one here?

118
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Well.

119
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,480
I thought I wouldn't have to expose you.

120
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,480
<i>I don't want you to tell anyone I'm here.</i>

121
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,840
<i>Why? Do you have a secret?</i>

122
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,360
<i>You could call it a secret.</i>

123
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>But I don’t want to be the gossip</i>
<i>of anyone in Ms. Ploy’s house.</i>

124
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,280
<i>Why?</i>

125
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
<i>Did you see the man</i>
<i>I was with in front of the elevator?</i>

126
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
<i>- Your boyfriend?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

127
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,800
<i>But he's someone else's husband.</i>

128
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,680
<i>I tried to leave the house for a long time</i>

129
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
<i>but couldn't find a good reason.</i>

130
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,880
<i>What he offered me</i>
<i>was too good to turn down.</i>

131
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,720
<i>I wouldn't be able to</i>
<i>make that much in my whole life.</i>

132
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,280
<i>You must be looking down on me</i>

133
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,560
<i>and wondering why</i>
<i>I agreed to be a mistress.</i>

134
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,320
Enough, Pu.
I don't want to listen anymore.

135
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,360
Sorry for being rude

136
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
and recording our conversation.

137
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
But as the CEO of Tharnthong Group,

138
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
I needed to do it

139
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,480
because I can't let anyone damage
our reputation anymore.

140
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,680
Do you have an excuse?

141
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,360
Don't believe him, Ms. Ploy.
He's a womanizer.

142
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,200
If I'm a womanizer,

143
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
then you're a man-eater.

144
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,440
Ms. Ploy, if you don't believe me,

145
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,240
you can go check her room.

146
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,520
I'm sure she's hiding
another man in there.

147
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,160
Aunt Ploy!

148
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,960
We need to talk.

149
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,880
I owe you an apology, Pu,

150
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,080
for all the trouble my people have caused.

151
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
It's all fine.

152
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,320
As long as you don't misunderstand me,
I’ll be relieved.

153
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,400
Then, please excuse me.

154
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
Mr. Pu.

155
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Yes?

156
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,680
There was a new tenant
who asked about you today.

157
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
Who was it? What did they ask you about?

158
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
We’re in different leagues.

159
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,680
You've broken my trust, Parit.

160
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,480
You were supposed to guide her
in doing the right thing.

161
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
And what is this?

162
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,000
You supported her in carrying out
this nonsensical scheme.

163
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
It was all my fault.

164
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,960
Parit tried to stop me,
but I didn't listen.

165
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,320
We can't blame Miang
for all of it, Aunt Ploy.

166
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,760
I wasn't being firm enough with her.

167
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,240
No need to take the blame.
You both are at fault here.

168
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,320
It's fortunate

169
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,960
that Mr. Pu has some respect for me.

170
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,600
If this happened to anyone else

171
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,160
and they held a grudge,
we'd all be humiliated.

172
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
And Camellia's reputation
would be damaged as well.

173
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,520
If I told you that everything
in the audio clip Mr. Pu played

174
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,280
was a story I made up,
would you believe me?

175
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,480
I knew from the first time
that it was a made-up story.

176
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I know you well enough.

177
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,360
But I had to play along

178
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,480
because you're wrong
no matter how I think about it.

179
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,120
I had to end it as quickly as possible.

180
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,400
From now on, stop bothering Mr. Pu.

181
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
I don't see any real evidence

182
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,160
to prove that Puwin is dating Dao

183
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,280
and planning to trick me with her
as you've claimed.

184
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,400
But I'm certain both of them…

185
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,520
Enough.

186
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,400
Stop everything,
before it gets out of hand.

187
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
But he can't be trusted.
His intention isn't…

188
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,880
This is my order. Move out of this condo

189
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,440
and come back home.

190
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,040
I will no longer give you any freedom.

191
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,280
For work, you can take a break

192
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,240
and go back when you're ready.

193
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
Parit.

194
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
You have to keep an eye on her

195
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
and don't let her cause any more trouble.

196
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
If she doesn't listen to you,

197
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,760
then tell me. I'll handle her myself.

198
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
Yes, Aunt Ploy.

199
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,240
Thank you for looking out for me,

200
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,720
but I can take care of myself.

201
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,200
Move back home tonight,

202
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,680
so you won't do anything stupid again.

203
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,120
I think

204
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,320
that was a punishment delivered with care.

205
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,560
I already told her

206
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,920
not to water the plants outside
when there's bright sunlight.

207
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,240
- She didn't listen. Now she's collapsed.
- I said I'm okay.

208
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,720
There's no need to bring me here.

209
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,640
Then, please take my mom
to the examination room.

210
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
Could you also call me when it's done?

211
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,320
Yes.

212
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,840
Miss Darinkarn,
the doctor is ready to see you.

213
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
This way please.

214
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,840
- What are you doing?!
- I want to know

215
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,560
why you are seeing the obstetrician.

216
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
What I do is none of your business.

217
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,080
- Give it back!
- No!

218
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,120
- Mon! You don't have any right to do this!
- Let go!

219
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
- Let go of me!
- Give it to me!

220
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Ma'am, could you please be careful?
She's pregnant.

221
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,040
Are you back?

222
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,280
I thought you were all high
and mighty, but you're just a failure

223
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
who had to come home.

224
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
Stop mocking her

225
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,680
and explain yourself.

226
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,800
What did you do at the hospital?!

227
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,200
It's exactly what you've been told.

228
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,760
My god. It's the truth?

229
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,960
Who got you pregnant?!

230
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm sure it's not Waythus.

231
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,200
Stop messing with me, Dao.

232
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,480
Tell me right now

233
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,480
who the father is!

234
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,800
Who do you think

235
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,840
I went to the seminar
in Khao Yai with last month?

236
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
That's the one.

237
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,280
Miss Dao and Mr. Parit?

238
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,000
I didn't want to accuse anyone
without any proof,

239
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,080
but Mr. Pu can confirm
what happened that day.

240
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,680
Good.

241
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,880
If that's the case,

242
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I'll call both of them here right now

243
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
so we can know the truth.

244
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
Perfect.

245
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,360
‪-Chawee.
‪-Yes.

246
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
Hold on to both of their phones,

247
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,200
so they can't plan
anything with those two.

248
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,440
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,880
<i>What did you do?</i>

250
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,880
Who got Miss Dao pregnant?

251
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
How should I know?

252
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,080
Ms. Ploy summoned me to her house.

253
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,720
Go wait for me at your house.

254
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
We have a lot to talk about.

255
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,640
And you…

256
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,040
Actually, I didn't want to say
anything about this

257
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,640
because it's none of my business.

258
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,880
But as it has turned out like this,

259
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,120
I'll have to explain.

260
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm sorry, Miss Dao.

261
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,400
Say what you want.
I have nothing to lose now.

262
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,080
Tell me what you saw.

263
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,520
Yes, Ms. Ploy.

264
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,160
So, on the first night of the seminar

265
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,960
was the welcome party.

266
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,520
It seemed like Miss Dao had a lot to drink
and got really drunk.

267
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,640
The staff at the resort

268
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,080
said that they saw Parit
taking her to her room.

269
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,160
I noticed that they had disappeared
for too long, so I tried to find them.

270
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,040
Then…

271
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,360
I saw Parit

272
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
come out of Miss Dao's room.

273
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,800
We had an argument
and it escalated into a fight,

274
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
so Miss Dao came out to stop us.

275
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,160
Parit didn't tell me any of that.

276
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,360
Gentlemen

277
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,480
don't kiss and tell.

278
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,200
I don't think we need to go into details
about what happened in the room.

279
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,720
It should be clear now

280
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,000
who the father of my child is.

281
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
I won't listen to
your side of the story alone, Dao.

282
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,440
I'll hear the truth from Parit first.

283
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
What Dao said is true.

284
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm the father of her child.

285
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,960
I'm glad

286
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,760
that you're taking responsibility
for your actions.

287
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,200
It is easy to find out

288
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,640
whether it's Parit's child or not.

289
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
Are you saying that
I'm a slut who sleeps around

290
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
and doesn't know
who the father of the child is?

291
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,960
You said it yourself.

292
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,840
I'm well aware of what you think about me.

293
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,280
Enough. No more fighting.

294
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,480
If Parit and Dao

295
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
are so sure about it,

296
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,080
then let's believe that's what happened.

297
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,120
I don't believe it.

298
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,080
It was a lie, right, Parit?

299
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,480
I didn't miss your call
and turned off my phone that night

300
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,360
because the battery died.

301
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,440
It was because Dao and I were…

302
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,160
If there's nothing else I can help with,

303
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,440
I have to get back to work.

304
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,160
Thank you so much, Pu, for stopping by.

305
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,120
With pleasure, Ms. Ploy.

306
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,960
And what are you two going to do?

307
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm fine with anything.
I'll leave it to your judgment.

308
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,680
If you admit that

309
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,600
you're the father of the child,
you'll have to marry Dao.

310
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,960
Sure.

311
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,480
Can I say something, Ms. Ploy?

312
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,760
Should we check first

313
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,640
if Mr. Parit is really the father?

314
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,000
Chawee. Are you saying
that I was sleeping around too?

315
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,280
No need to be afraid
if you're sure about it.

316
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
That way, there will be no doubts.

317
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,840
How could we do that?
She just got pregnant.

318
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,120
It's too dangerous.

319
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,720
We should wait until the child is born
and do the DNA test if we must.

320
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Do you want me to go through
this pregnancy without a father?

321
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll be humiliated.

322
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,640
And don't you even think about Mr. Parit?!

323
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,120
I'm willing to do it, Chawee.

324
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,160
Parit is willing to do it,

325
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,440
and what's your problem?

326
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,520
It's okay, Chawee.

327
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,880
If they're willing to marry each other,

328
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,800
then so be it.

329
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,480
Yes, Ms. Ploy.

330
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,600
So, I'll check for
an auspicious wedding date for you.

331
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,480
It’s better to tie the knot
before the bump is too noticeable.

332
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,120
And after

333
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,720
the baby is born, we can talk more
if you want to check

334
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,520
if it really is your child.

335
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Thank you, Aunt Ploy.

336
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,880
Thank you, Aunt Ploy.

337
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,600
Wait, Parit.

338
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,720
I knew

339
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
you would be a gentleman

340
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,920
and do anything to protect my reputation.

341
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,320
Thank you so much.

342
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,240
Dao!

343
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,240
You're too drunk. Go to sleep.

344
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,600
If I were Miang, you wouldn't have
pushed me away like this.

345
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
Yes.

346
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
Because Miang
wouldn't do something like this.

347
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,120
Right. She’s always the good one

348
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,720
in your eyes, compared to me.

349
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Go to bed now.

350
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,160
We have the seminar in the morning.

351
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,560
If you don't stay with me
until I fall asleep,

352
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,520
I'll go back to the party.

353
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,920
And if I'm drunk
and cause any trouble for the company,

354
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,680
you can come up
with excuses for Ms. Ploy yourself.

355
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,160
I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep, okay?

356
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,880
You have to hold my hand all night too.

357
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,240
Come.

358
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,480
Here.

359
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
Easy.

360
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,800
I love you, Parit.

361
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,160
Dao.

362
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Aren't you going to ask me

363
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
who the father is?

364
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,080
If you wanted to be with him,
you wouldn't choose me.

365
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,320
You've made the right decision to help me.

366
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,120
So, see you.

367
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,760
Yeah.

368
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
Parit.

369
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,320
Did it hurt?

370
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,400
It still hurts.

371
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm sorry.
I feared it wouldn't be convincing.

372
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,960
Does it hurt much?

373
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,280
I think you're making it worse, Miang.

374
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,640
I was afraid you wouldn't get my signal.

375
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I lost it when you mentioned
the battery dying.

376
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,240
But nothing really happened
between Dao and me.

377
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,960
Don't worry.

378
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,840
I trust you no matter what.

379
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,080
You're the best. Thank you.

380
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,720
But whether he loves Dao
or just her money,

381
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm sure…

382
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,960
he would never let me
be the father of his child.

383
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,040
Mr. Pu will definitely get involved.

384
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,360
Dao is probably using me
to make people think

385
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
she and Mr. Pu are not together.

386
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,880
Miang.

387
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,080
Aunt Ploy will have me marry Dao.

388
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,160
But I'm sure…

389
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,000
that Mr. Pu
won't let us have this wedding.

390
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,480
He has to do everything
to prevent it from happening.

391
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,880
The only thing left to do is wait

392
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
to expose him in front of Ms. Ploy.

393
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
You're such a genius.

394
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,080
Next time you're going to do anything,
ask me first!

395
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,720
We're on the same side.
If you start a beef like this,

396
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,400
how are you supposed to
work together now?!

397
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,680
Are you sure you aren't fooling me?

398
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,760
Why do I have to?

399
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,400
I just went to
clear everything up with Ms. Ploy.

400
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,160
Miss Dao and that new manager

401
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,160
were sleeping together
while they were in Khao Yai.

402
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,520
She got pregnant right away.

403
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
He wants her money.

404
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,920
Fine, if that's really the case.

405
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,720
But don't let me find out

406
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,240
that you’re after that mother and daughter
and planning to ditch me.

407
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
Otherwise,

408
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,280
I'll prove to everyone that I'm your wife.

409
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,880
I'll just make it all fall apart.

410
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,640
I'm not just threatening you,
I'd really do it.

411
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,440
Why do I lose so many times?!

412
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm tired of it.

413
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,640
Chawee?

414
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
CHAWEE

415
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,920
<i>Ms. Kanta, did you know</i>
<i>about Miss Dao's pregnancy?</i>

416
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Pregnancy?!

417
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,960
<i>Mr. Parit is the father.</i>

418
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,000
<i>Ms. Ploy is checking</i>
<i>an auspicious date for their wedding.</i>

419
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,120
<i>Don't tell anyone I told you this.</i>

420
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,520
Damn you.

421
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,160
Are you marrying my daughter

422
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,120
to that pathetic neighbor?

423
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,200
I won't allow it!

424
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
I'm so sorry, Miang.

425
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,720
I didn't mean to take Parit from you.

426
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,120
But I already got pregnant,
so I want the best for my child.

427
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,240
We can do the DNA test
to confirm if it's really his child

428
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,560
and it still won't be
too late for you to say sorry.

429
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,480
Then I'll give the marketing manager
position back to you.

430
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,960
I'm pregnant now,
and might not be able to work.

431
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,080
But I actually feel bad for you, Miang.

432
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,360
You've lost your loved one
and your job at the same time.

433
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,320
It would be too cruel for you.

434
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,600
Do I have to thank you?

435
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,880
Pregnant or not,

436
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,640
you wouldn't be able to do it.

437
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,080
This job is beyond your ability.

438
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,520
Then good luck catching Mr. Pu…

439
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,720
Oh?

440
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,240
That's not it.

441
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,640
Good luck hitting on Mr. Pu.

442
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm not interested in a man

443
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,560
who already has a wife.

444
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
What are you saying?

445
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,360
It wasn't hard to understand.

446
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,520
Mr. Pu already has a wife.

447
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,920
They've had their wedding ceremony.

448
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,680
What? You didn't know?

449
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,640
Ms. Ploy knew about this.

450
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,960
She knew before I did too.

451
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,280
Wait. Walk slowly.

452
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,600
You walk like you aren't pregnant.

453
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,480
That's because I'm anxious.
I have something to ask you.

454
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,040
What is it?

455
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Miang told me Mr. Pu
already has a wife. Is that true?

456
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,720
If you know that,
why are you still going out with him?

457
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,320
They're divorced.

458
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,800
He introduced his ex-wife to me.

459
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,000
There's so much I don't know.

460
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,640
Thank you so much for worrying about me.

461
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,480
I have to get to work.

462
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,000
Aunt Ploy.

463
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,880
Do you know his ex-wife's name?

464
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,680
Do I know her?

465
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,920
I’m not sure if you’ve met her.

466
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,280
Her name is Nichamon.

467
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,120
She's that woman

468
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,680
who was behind the false accusation
during Camellia's festival.

469
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,840
Here.

470
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,600
This is their wedding photo.

471
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,320
Is this your spot?

472
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,280
Don't you see the sign?
It's a designated parking spot.

473
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,920
I'm in a hurry, and there are
no spots left.

474
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,880
I'm thinking about
picking up Ms. Ploy for lunch.

475
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,400
Did you make an appointment?

476
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,840
Why do I have to?

477
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,280
We go out to eat together all the time.

478
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,800
Then you might be here for nothing.

479
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,560
She told me she'd go check for
an auspicious date for my wedding to Dao.

480
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,840
Are you trying to marry into money?

481
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,960
Even though I'm not actually the father,

482
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,320
I'll still be glad to be.

483
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,840
And I won't even do a DNA test.

484
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,440
It would be such a waste.

485
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm going to be rich.

486
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,720
And we'd be honored to have you
at our wedding party.

487
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,520
We'll just have a small wedding at home
with the water pouring ceremony.

488
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,200
But we'll register a certificate.
That's the most important part.

489
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,080
I'll take Dao's VIP parking spot then.

490
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,480
Ms. Lee.

491
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,040
You have a guest waiting for you.

492
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,720
How did they know
I was going to be in the office?

493
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,280
She called to check first.

494
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,520
You had personally
welcomed her before, so…

495
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,320
Who?

496
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,960
Do you think you can come anytime
without an appointment?

497
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,040
If you don't want to talk,
I'll just leave.

498
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,080
What do you want?

499
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,040
A well-connected individual like you

500
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,680
must have seen
the video of me in the hospital.

501
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,120
I've seen it.

502
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,160
What was that all about?

503
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,200
It's your employee.

504
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,560
She picked a fight
with me out of jealousy.

505
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,840
Nichamon? She's not married.

506
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,040
Don't tell me you don't know about it yet.

507
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,160
Say what you want to say.
Speaking in riddles is frustrating.

508
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,680
What?

509
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,440
See for yourself.

510
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,160
It's clear. No explanation needed.

511
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,280
How did you let him get you pregnant?!

512
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,120
If it was Mr. Pu, I wouldn't say a word!

513
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,880
Who told you about it?

514
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,560
You don't have to know!

515
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,600
And what's wrong with Parit?

516
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,080
My god.

517
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,680
Goodness and love

518
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,280
won't make you rich!

519
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,080
Going through hard times together

520
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,320
is not real.

521
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,520
I see it all the time.

522
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,760
If couples have money problems,

523
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,520
their marriages are doomed from the start.

524
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,080
Parit is not even poor, Mom.

525
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,800
But he's not as wealthy as Mr. Pu!

526
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,960
You've made a lot of money
from working with Mr. Pu!

527
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,880
If it goes according to the plan,

528
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,720
Tharnthong Group will be in our hands.

529
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,400
Are you only worried about your share,

530
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,280
or about my happiness?

531
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,280
Sit down.

532
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,800
Hey. From my own experience,

533
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,400
true and everlasting happiness

534
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,800
is having an account full of money!

535
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,640
You can call me money-hungry if you want.

536
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,840
money isn't true happiness.

537
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,680
But for me,

538
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,600
all the happiness that I have

539
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,640
can be bought with money!

540
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,760
Instead of being mad at me,

541
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,080
you should blame this bitch
for ruining the secret.

542
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,280
Have you seen the video
of me in the hospital?

543
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,720
Who is this bitch?!

544
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,280
I'm back, Mom.

545
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,440
What? Why are you so clumsy?

546
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,520
Why are you here, Ms. Lee?

547
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,400
The mother
of my favorite employee is sick.

548
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,280
How could I not visit her?

549
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,840
Thank you so much, Ms. Lee,

550
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,600
for everything you do for Mon.

551
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,920
She has worked for me
for such a long time, ma'am.

552
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,160
I love her like a sister.

553
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,200
You could say that I trust her the most.

554
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,800
Mon. What's the matter with you today?

555
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,880
Excuse me.

556
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,240
Your time for a checkup
is coming up, ma'am.

557
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,600
Let me help.

558
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,920
It's okay.

559
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,720
Please feel free to stay with the guest.

560
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,480
We'll handle it and bring
your mother back here when it's done.

561
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,120
Excuse me.

562
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,600
Please be careful.

563
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,360
Mon. Stay with Ms. Lee.

564
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,080
The nurses will take care of me.

565
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Let's go.

566
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Excuse me.

567
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,400
How could you do this to me?!

568
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,040
- What did I do, Ms. Lee?
- Are you seriously asking me that?!

569
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,640
Ms. Lee.

570
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,280
Please let go of me. It hurts.

571
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,880
You’re a bit hurt on the outside,
but I’m hurting really bad inside!

572
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

573
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,600
I didn't mean to…

574
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
You've had the wedding and the ceremony,

575
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,120
and you say you didn't mean to?!

576
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,960
Your mother told me all about it.

577
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,120
I saw the photos too.
How could you do this to me?!

578
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
I shouldn’t have trusted you.

579
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,640
You’ve been putting on an act
like you can’t stand Pu in front of me.

580
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,080
You lying bitch!

581
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,160
Ms. Lee.

582
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,640
Please forgive me.
I've learned a lesson now.

583
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,760
Break up with Pu,

584
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,120
and disappear from his life!

585
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,560
If you still want to live,

586
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,160
don't ever let me see your face again.

587
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,600
Yes, Ms. Lee.

588
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,040
I'll do everything you told me.

589
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,040
I was too impulsive.

590
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,160
If I took more time to think,

591
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,760
it wouldn't have all ended up like this.

592
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,280
Would you really go through
with divorcing Mr. Pu?

593
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,120
But it would go according to his plan.

594
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,160
What else can I do?

595
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,040
Miss Dao is going to
marry a manager at Camellia soon.

596
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,400
Mr. Pu will now have only one option.

597
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,440
He won't let go of Ms. Ploy.

598
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,560
I don't know what he has up his sleeves.

599
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,720
I have no one left.

600
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,440
Can you help me with something?

601
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,960
What is it?

602
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,440
Now you're here.

603
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,560
Do you have any idea how many crazy things
I had to deal with because of you?

604
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,400
Don't blame me.

605
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,400
Do you think I didn't have to do anything?

606
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,120
Who started all this? Wasn't it your wife?

607
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,200
- What are you saying?
- We’ve come this far.

608
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,600
Stop with the lies.

609
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,880
You've been lying to me all this time.

610
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,760
You're dating me
while being married to Mon, aren't you?

611
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,440
- It's not what you--
- Shut your mouth. I don't want to hear it.

612
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,160
I will marry Parit.

613
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,120
Go ahead and date Aunt Ploy if you want.

614
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,920
But I'm the father of your child.

615
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,360
So what?

616
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,320
The DNA results will show that.

617
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,600
Do you really think a gentleman like Parit

618
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,240
would go through with a DNA test?

619
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,240
There are eight or nine months left.

620
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,520
Do you really think
it's impossible for me to make him love me

621
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,280
and care about the child?

622
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,960
Change of plan.

623
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,480
For Ms. Lee, you can do whatever you want.

624
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,840
I'm done.

625
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,000
Bye.

626
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,240
It won't be that easy.

627
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,000
If you're this hurt,

628
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,640
we should do something
to put them in a difficult situation.

629
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,680
What’s your idea?

630
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,840
<i>Keep it safe.</i>

631
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,520
It will come in handy for you someday.

632
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,360
HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

633
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,680
You can't run away from me.

634
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,920
I'm the father of your child after all.

635
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,640
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before the secret is out</i>

636
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,840
Where did you keep the ring, Dao?
Please show it to my mom.

637
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,080
Wow.

638
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,160
It's really lovely. You have a good eye.

639
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,560
I won't lose
my girlfriend and my child to him.

640
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,640
I don't want him as my son-in-law either!

641
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,440
Then if the groom is gone,

642
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,320
there will be no wedding.

643
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,160
