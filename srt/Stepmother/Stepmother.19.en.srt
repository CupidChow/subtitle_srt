1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,280
There's a development
in Ms. Nichamon's case.

2
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>They must be quite sure</i>
<i>that there was an accomplice.</i>

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
Don't tell me it's Dao.

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,480
I've waited my entire life

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,600
for you to open up

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,320
and accept me.

7
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,480
This man tricked my mother into
poisoning Nichamon's food to kill her.

8
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,120
You want me
to water your plants for you, right?

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Looks like Ms. Mon
is trying to tell you something.

10
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,320
<i>Is it about hydrangeas?</i>

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,760
Nichamon is now the key

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
<i>to exposing his crimes.</i>

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,560
<i>He must not want her to recover.</i>

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Hello.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,400
We were together just a little while ago.
Do you miss me?

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
I missed you
the moment you said good night.

17
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,560
Parit.

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Do you remember the hydrangea
planting guide Ms. Mon gave me?

19
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,960
Yeah, I do. Why?

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,120
<i>Ms. Mon marked three asterisks under</i>

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,520
general properties of hydrangeas.

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,880
So, I tried to look into it
in more detail.

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,200
Did you find anything?

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
The details are fairly generic,

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,520
but there's one thing I never knew about.

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,320
What is it?

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,720
<i>The book says that</i>

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,280
if hydrangeas

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,680
are planted in soil
with different acidity levels

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,880
the flowers will show different colors.

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,760
In alkaline soil,
the flowers will be pink.

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,240
But in acidic soil, they'll turn blue.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
- That's new.
- Yeah.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

35
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,320
Other parts are quite generic.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
I think we need to go to the place
to get a clear idea of what it is.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
Right.

38
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,640
Why is this one a different color?

39
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,480
They're planted in the same soil,

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
and how would the acidity
be different for just this one?

41
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,480
He parked in front of the house.

42
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
He just went in.

43
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
They came back out together now.

44
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,520
They took something from the house.
She's carrying it in a bag.

45
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,520
<i>Follow them, and keep me posted.</i>

46
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,240
Right.

47
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
- Is he following us?
- Hmm.

48
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,920
And when did Dao leave the house?

49
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,280
A little bit before us.

50
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,640
He probably doesn’t know yet
that thing is with Dao. Let him follow us.

51
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
Ms. Ploy should be
at the police station now too.

52
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
He won't get away this time.

53
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,720
Miss Dao.

54
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,520
Are you free tomorrow morning?

55
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
Could you go to Nichamon's house with me?

56
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
What's going on there?

57
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,080
I won't go in there with you.

58
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
You can wait in the car.

59
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
How will you get in there?

60
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,240
I have the key.
Ms. Mon's mother gave it to me.

61
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
I'll be right back.

62
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm heading out, Miang.

63
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,080
It was buried in the backyard.

64
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,840
Why did she do that?

65
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,280
There are blood stains as well.

66
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
This is a man's shirt.

67
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,880
<i>I hid it in the drawer</i>
<i>under the bed. Burn it.</i>

68
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Puwin has some shirts similar to this one.

69
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,400
Puwin's man is following Parit here.

70
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll go wait for Parit,
and lure him the other way.

71
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,120
Go to the police station.
Ms. Ploy is heading there too.

72
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,240
Miang, send him the photo.

73
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
Right.

74
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
Mon.

75
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
You betrayed me!

76
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,920
- Yes?
- Are you still on their tail?

77
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm right behind them.

78
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,880
Good.

79
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,920
Don't let those two get away,
and get my shirt back to me.

80
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
I don't care

81
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,200
whether they're dead or alive,
I must have my shirt back.

82
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
Is 500,000 baht enough?

83
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Wait.

84
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Did you see Miss Dao with them?

85
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,400
I didn't.

86
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,240
<i>What is it, Bomb?</i>

87
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
I have a job for you guys.

88
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Alright, Boss.

89
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Hey, let's go.

90
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,840
Let's go, Miang!

91
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,400
Go.

92
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,240
Faster!

93
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Don’t let them escape!

94
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,840
Miang, here.

95
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
Miang.

96
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,160
Stay right here. I’ll lure them away.

97
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
- But…
- No, Miang!

98
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,160
You have to stay here.

99
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
Parit!

100
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,400
Stop right there!

101
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Where's the thing? Where is it?!

102
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,840
Hey!

103
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,360
You tricked me?! You tricked me?!

104
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,680
Go!

105
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,400
Parit.

106
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,000
Cuff them.

107
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,360
Take their weapons.

108
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,320
Let go of me!

109
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
Get up.

110
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,520
‪POLICE STATION FOR THE PUBLIC

111
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Dao isn't here yet, Miang.

112
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,520
She's not picking up my calls either.

113
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,920
Is everything okay?

114
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
Keep calling her, Miang.

115
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,880
Dao.

116
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,280
Miss Dao.

117
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
I have the evidence.

118
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,360
How did it end up with you?

119
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,480
You didn't think
this would happen, did you?

120
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
Where are you?

121
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,440
If you want your shirt back,

122
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,280
come get it where we had our first date.

123
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,680
Dao.

124
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't tell me
Miss Dao will betray us again.

125
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
That's unlikely.

126
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
Miss Dao just texted me.

127
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,840
What does it say?

128
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,760
"If I fail, the evidence is in the car."

129
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
What is she going to do?

130
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,160
She sent me her location.

131
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,480
- Ms. Ploy.
- What are you doing here?

132
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,360
I came to see Miss Dao,

133
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,040
but she's not here.

134
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,200
Are you trying to silence my daughter?

135
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,080
The evidence is clearly pointing to you.

136
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,600
You can't escape.

137
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
What are you talking about?

138
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,240
After all this time,
do you really think I don't know?

139
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,240
I might have been mistaken

140
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,000
and fallen for you for a while,

141
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,160
but I'm not blind.

142
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,160
You’re not better than everyone else,
no matter what you think.

143
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
Before accusing me of anything,

144
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,280
make sure you have the evidence first.

145
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,760
Evidence?

146
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,200
Oh, I have it.

147
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,920
I'm not afraid of you.

148
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
Then watch yourself…

149
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,560
you hag.

150
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,720
And watch your daughter as well.

151
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,720
If you do anything to my daughter,

152
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,560
whether it's Dao or Miang,

153
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,000
I won’t let you get away with this.

154
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,080
‪What is it, Miang?

155
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,880
<i>Ms. Ploy, I know where Miss Dao is now.</i>

156
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,200
Where is she?

157
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,080
That's Miss Dao's car.

158
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,760
Let's go.

159
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,960
She said the evidence was in the car.

160
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,160
And where is she?

161
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
We should split up and look for her.
She must be around here.

162
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
- I'll go this way.
- Then I'll go that way.

163
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,160
Miang.

164
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,840
Be careful.

165
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
Puwin.

166
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,080
What did you do to Miss Dao?

167
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,320
Miang.

168
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,360
It's all because of you.

169
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
You kept nosing around.

170
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,000
Turn yourself in.
You can't get away this time.

171
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,080
Turn myself in?

172
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
I'm not stupid.

173
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,720
Give me back my shirt.

174
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,480
I won't, even if it costs me my life.

175
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,760
You said it yourself.

176
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,400
You'll get what you wish for.

177
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,600
Miang!

178
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,120
Dao.

179
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
You won't survive this shot.

180
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't you see they're using you?

181
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,960
Like how you used my mother and Nichamon?

182
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
Do you think I'm that stupid?!

183
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
And do you think switching sides now

184
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,480
makes you a good girl?

185
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,040
We're as vile as each other.

186
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,760
But you can't keep getting away
with what you've done.

187
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
Give my shirt back.

188
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,120
You can't get away now.
The police are coming.

189
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,640
Do you really think
that only one piece of evidence

190
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
can do anything to me?

191
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,080
I know you're cunning and slippery.

192
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,200
You won't be in jail for long.

193
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,760
Someone like you doesn't deserve to live!

194
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,800
Don't do it, Dao!

195
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,960
Dao!

196
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,960
Trust me.

197
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,280
Don’t throw your life away
for such a disgusting person.

198
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,800
Don't do it, Miss Dao.

199
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,560
The police are coming. You're done.
Put the gun down.

200
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,160
Put the gun down?

201
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,680
Then she'd shoot me dead!

202
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,480
But if I have to die,

203
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
there's no way I will die alone.

204
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,760
Dao.

205
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,080
It's too late.

206
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
This is the only way I can stop him!

207
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,600
Don't, Dao!

208
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
Dao! Stop!

209
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,800
Aunt Ploy! Aunt Ploy!

210
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,280
Ms. Ploy.

211
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,960
Don't do it!

212
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,480
Don't do it, Pu!

213
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,680
Don't you dare hurt Dao.

214
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,160
Then please go love each other in hell.

215
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,480
Put down the weapon and surrender!

216
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,760
In the end, someone must die for me.

217
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,000
What are you going to do?

218
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,040
You must do it.

219
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,280
We're approaching the finish line.

220
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,160
Everything Panalee owns

221
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,080
is about to be ours.

222
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,480
You have to do it yourself.

223
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,280
Ms. Ploy.

224
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Aunt Ploy.

225
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
Mon! Mon! No!

226
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,960
Mon! Don't leave me!

227
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,560
Mon! Wake up!

228
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,600
Mon! Mon!

229
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,680
I was listening through the door.

230
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,840
I heard everything.

231
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,520
Mr. Puwin was the one
who murdered Mr. Waythus.

232
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,520
I was afraid, so I didn't tell anyone.

233
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Please don't arrest me, officer.

234
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,200
Please don't put me in jail.
I wasn't involved.

235
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,560
Here she comes!

236
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,040
Miss Darinkarn is here.

237
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,280
Please make way for us.

238
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,440
Excuse me.

239
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,400
Please move.

240
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,440
- Please move aside.
- What was the court's ruling?

241
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,400
- Can I have a question, please?
- Excuse me.

242
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,800
<i>Miss Darinkarn Kitchaphinan</i>
<i>has been charged</i>

243
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,720
<i>as an accomplice in Ms. Panalee's murder.</i>

244
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,520
<i>With mitigating circumstances,</i>
<i>the court has spoken.</i>

245
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
- <i>It sentenced her to 20 years in prison.</i>
- What did the judge say?

246
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,520
<i>It was reported that Miss Darinkarn</i>

247
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,080
<i>will not be appealing the ruling.</i>

248
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
Take as many photos as possible.

249
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm sorry.

250
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,720
I'm sorry, Aunt Ploy. I'm sorry.

251
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,040
How are you doing?

252
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,720
Have you adjusted to being here?

253
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm trying to.

254
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
But you're too skinny now.

255
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,480
You need to eat more, alright?

256
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,400
Did you see your mother?

257
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,000
She's trying to avoid me.

258
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,720
She must not want to
be involved in my case.

259
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't think about it.

260
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Don't think about what would upset you.

261
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,960
You should focus
on your mental well-being.

262
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,440
This is the most important thing.

263
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,960
I have the chance to think
about many things in here, Aunt Ploy.

264
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,640
I wonder why I was so stupid.

265
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,560
What was blinding me?

266
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Why wasn't I able to realize

267
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,000
or see the truth?

268
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,040
Seeing you realize this

269
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,800
makes me feel so relieved.

270
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,560
It wasn't too late.

271
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,880
You don’t have any prior criminal record.

272
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,480
If you behave while you're in here,

273
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,800
it won't take long.

274
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,240
It'll be a while. Just be patient, Dao.

275
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
Just a short while,
and you'll be able to go home.

276
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,960
If Parit and Miang want to visit me,

277
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,640
tell them they can come anytime.

278
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,880
I'm…

279
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm lonely.

280
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,520
Alright. I'll tell them.

281
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,560
I'll come see you a lot too.

282
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
Even more often.

283
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,120
It's funny.

284
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,080
The one I hated

285
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,640
and wanted to destroy the most

286
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
turns out to be the one who loves

287
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,080
and cares about me,

288
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,960
and forgives everything I did

289
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,160
no matter how bad it was.

290
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,560
Don't cry.

291
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
If you keep crying like this,

292
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,480
I won't come visit again.

293
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,680
I'll have to stop crying as well.

294
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,480
There is one thing Dad asked of me

295
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,920
and even after his death,

296
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,080
I still couldn't bring myself to do it.

297
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
What is it?

298
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,560
Do you want me to help you with it?

299
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,240
Dad asked me to call you…

300
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,440
"Mom."

301
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,400
When I get out of here,

302
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,720
please let me fulfill Dad's wish.

303
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,840
Of course.

304
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,200
I'll wait for you.

305
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,440
I'll wait for you.

306
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,920
Ah.

307
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,960
Okay.

308
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,600
Please forgive me, Ms. Ploy,

309
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,400
that we have to
propose to your daughter online.

310
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,240
It's Parit who couldn't wait.

311
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,200
He was afraid Miang would change her mind.

312
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,240
I don't mind it at all.

313
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,520
We talked a little bit when you were here

314
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,840
and I have no objections at all.
It's just a matter of time.

315
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,800
And I'm so happy for these two.

316
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm very happy as well.

317
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,280
I've been rooting for them
for a long time.

318
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,960
I didn't think I would live long enough
to witness their marriage.

319
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,920
You'll witness it, Chawee.

320
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,560
You'll probably see
our great-grandchildren too.

321
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,920
<i>My son is such a show-off.</i>

322
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,640
If your father were still around,

323
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,400
he would come to congratulate you.

324
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,520
I'm lucky enough

325
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,760
to have you and Chawee.

326
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,680
If not, I would feel like
I was alone in this world.

327
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,920
From now on, you'll have me

328
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,760
and Mom as your family.

329
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
<i>I want…</i>

330
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
<i>four or five grandchildren.</i>

331
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,640
<i>So we'll be a big family,</i>
<i>and never be lonely.</i>

332
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,160
I can't do that, Teacher.

333
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,080
You can!

334
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,080
Parit.

335
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,440
Take care of her for me.

336
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,400
And please love Miang

337
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,280
as much as we love her.

338
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,520
You don't have to worry.

339
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,720
I'll love her
more than everyone else combined.

340
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,960
Please be the witness, Teacher.

341
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,160
<i>Please take care of Parit, Miang.</i>

342
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,920
<i>If he's stubborn, you can spank him.</i>
<i>I grant you permission.</i>

343
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,920
Huh?

344
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,680
I kept my promise, Maratee.

345
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,360
Please rest assured.

346
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,640
Love each other for a long time to come.

347
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,760
Hey, someone is sitting here
with tears in her eyes.

348
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,240
I wish

349
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,480
the two of you
all the happiness in your marriage.

350
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,320
Live together

351
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,960
with kindness
and help each other in times of need.

352
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,440
Yes, Chawee.

353
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,200
- Thank you.
- Right.

354
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,080
<i>Miang.</i>

355
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,280
<i>I love you, Miang.</i>

356
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,920
This is one of
the happiest days of my life, Maratee.

357
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,880
It feels like

358
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,840
I can get one of my daughters
to the next stage of her life.

359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,240
Congratulations.

360
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,880
Too bad I can't go to the wedding.

361
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,280
When you're out of here,
we can celebrate together again.

362
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Let's do that.

363
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,520
I wish you two a long-lasting love

364
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,240
and all the happiness.

365
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,640
Thank you.

366
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,400
My mom sends you regards.

367
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,120
She said she'll visit you
when she comes to my wedding.

368
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,520
Thank you.

369
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,800
Have kids soon, so I can have someone
to play with when I'm out of here.

370
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,280
Oh.

371
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,160
Boys or girls, you can tell me
which you want.

372
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,280
Wow, are you able to manage that?

373
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,360
Miss Dao.

374
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,840
I have something for you.

375
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,040
I saw that it was left in your room,

376
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,320
so I kept it for you.

377
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,520
I didn't want you

378
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,560
to leave our bonds behind.

379
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,160
All this time,

380
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,240
no matter how good or bad things were,

381
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,360
I don't have any other siblings.

382
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,120
I have only you.

383
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,680
Whether we love or hate each other,

384
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,720
I still want us to stay together
as we always have.

385
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,960
Miang. If you're like this,

386
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,840
I won't allow you to visit again.

387
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,080
Be empathetic

388
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,920
and be kind to each other.
Take good care of her.

389
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,280
You're all grown up now.
Talk nicely to each other.

390
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,720
Love each other forever.
Always forgive each other.

391
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,920
Yes, Mom.

392
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,160
I wish you all the happiness, Parit.

393
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,600
Take good care of Miang.

394
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,480
Today is my happiest day.

395
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
I wish you nothing but happiness.

396
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,800
The Chief Advisor is here to see you.

397
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,000
Aunt Ploy.

398
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

399
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,080
How are you doing? Are you tired?

400
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,000
It's quite challenging.

401
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,640
That means he's tired.

402
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,480
But I'm so glad
to have you working for the company.

403
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,800
Yes, Aunt Ploy.

404
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,600
And what about you?

405
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,720
Where did you two go?

406
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
We went for the ultrasound
to check the baby's gender.

407
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,000
Huh?

408
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,920
Did you find out
if the baby is a boy or a girl?

409
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,360
I won't tell you.

410
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,640
What?

411
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,120
I don't know.

412
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,240
What? Can't you tell me?

413
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,200
- You won't tell me?
- I won't tell you.

414
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,320
You won't?

415
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,400
What?

416
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,000
- Parit.
- Are you going to tell me?

417
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,320
- That's enough.
- I'll just kiss you in front of Aunt Ploy.

418
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
- Enough already.
- Are you going to tell me now?

419
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,440
YEARS LATER

420
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,600
PROHIBITED AREA

421
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,040
Dao.

422
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,680
Are you going to miss Grandma?

423
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,920
Mom must be so excited.
She won't be lonely for years to come.

424
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,840
Or she might want her quiet life back.

425
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,480
If I was a bit younger,
I would go with you.

426
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,920
- Wow.
- Oh, you wish.

427
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,120
I would be so worried about the house.

428
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,280
Right, boy?

429
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,560
I'll be away for a month.
Will you miss me?

430
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,400
I'll miss you so bad.

431
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,480
Miss Dao. Graduate quickly,

432
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,920
so we can work together.

433
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,400
Only if I don't meet someone
in the States first.

434
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,400
I didn't know
you had a thing for white boys too.

435
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,400
Let's go, Dao. I'll wait in the car.

436
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,720
Right, Mom.

437
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,920
Have a safe journey, Ms. Ploy.

438
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,240
Thanks.

439
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, Grandma.

440
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,760
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

441
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,520
Bye-bye.

442
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,400
Come on.

443
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,240
<i>I've never taken pride</i>
<i>in being a stepmother,</i>

444
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,600
<i>a role I was reluctant</i>
<i>to take on for over ten years.</i>

445
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,880
<i>I took care of Dao and Miang</i>
<i>because I needed to.</i>

446
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,840
<i>I saw it as nothing more than a duty.</i>

447
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,240
Are you going to wear it now?

448
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>But now, that has completely changed.</i>

449
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,640
- Yeah, good boy.
- Yeah.

450
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,160
<i>Even though I've never been pregnant,</i>
<i>given birth, breastfed,</i>

451
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,240
<i>or experienced true motherhood,</i>

452
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,160
<i>I now understand</i>
<i>what it feels like to be a mother.</i>

453
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,200
<i>How I spend every breath</i>
<i>worrying about my children.</i>

454
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,520
<i>How I care about them</i>
<i>without expecting anything in return.</i>

455
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,800
<i>So this is what it feels like.</i>

456
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,200
<i>Now I'm incredibly happy and fulfilled.</i>

457
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,000
<i>It's the first time in my life</i>

458
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,560
<i>that I'm proud of my role as stepmother.</i>

459
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,680
<i>This must be what they call true love.</i>

460
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:14,040
THE END
