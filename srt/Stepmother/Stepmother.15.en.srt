1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
If this is what you want,

2
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,720
just don’t cry over it later.

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,840
If I can groom you,
I can destroy you as well.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
Wait for it, Pu.

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,120
<i>Enjoy it while you can.</i>

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,640
Tonight, you'll smile for the last time.

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,240
I'll kill you. Ploysaeng!

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,960
How could you do this to me?!

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Stop! Don't!

10
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,240
<i>Update.</i>

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,040
<i>The CCTV footage</i>
<i>provided quite clear evidence</i>

12
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
<i>that the one</i>
<i>who brutally murdered Ms. Panalee</i>

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
<i>might be a well-known business rival,</i>

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
<i>Ms. Ploysaeng Kitchaphinan.</i>

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,600
I can't do it.

16
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,040
But I don't trust anyone, except you.

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,320
This is serious.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,880
You're ordering me to kill someone.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
Listen carefully.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Everything in my plan is in place.

21
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,120
If you do as I say,

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,560
there will be no evidence
connected to you.

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
What about Khaosuay?

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
She's not home. I've taken care of it.

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
But the CCTV was just installed.

26
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
You don't have to worry.

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,000
I've prepared everything.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,920
All you have to do

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
is play Ploysaeng.

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,200
It's too much for me. I can't do it.

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,720
You must do it.

32
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,080
We're approaching the finish line.

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
Everything Panalee owns

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
is about to be ours.

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,680
We're going to be happy together.

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,680
You need to be the last puzzle piece

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,680
for both of us.

38
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,840
You…

39
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
Stop! Don't!

40
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Don't.

41
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,520
You did the best you could.

42
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,040
No need to worry about anything.

43
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
From now on, we'll be well off.

44
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,240
No one would dare to abuse us.

45
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
Don't cry.

46
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
Tonight's job was the most crucial move

47
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,280
and it needed to be done
by you who I trust the most

48
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,040
What about the gun? Where do I put it?

49
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Hide it in your house.

50
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,080
The police won't make
any connection to you.

51
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,280
If you're afraid
and want to lay low in the countryside,

52
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
you can do it.

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,160
Don't worry.

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,800
We've been through hard times together.

55
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,760
I won't abandon you.

56
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,280
POLICE STATION FOR THE PUBLIC

57
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
- Excuse us.
- The CCTV footage.

58
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,520
- Was that really you?
- Were you two friends from college?

59
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
You'll have a chance
to interview the lawyer.

60
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Please make way for us.

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,680
Can you answer our questions?

62
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,200
What did you
tell the police, Ms. Ploysaeng?

63
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,440
Can I ask you a question?

64
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,960
Excuse me. Please move.

65
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,240
- Ms. Ploysaeng.
- Please talk to us.

66
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,440
What did you tell the police?

67
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,480
Excuse me, Ms. Ploysaeng.

68
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,880
Ms. Ploysaeng!

69
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,280
<i>Ms. Ploysaeng was granted bail</i>

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,960
<i>secured by two million baht.</i>

71
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,760
Well, you finally show up.

72
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm pregnant, remember?

73
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,800
Your tummy is tiny compared to mine.
Come and sit here.

74
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,200
Sit down.

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,880
You aren't involved
in this murder, are you?

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,880
I knew a little bit about it
but didn't get involved.

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,280
Then why was that dress

78
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,040
identical to your stepmother's?

79
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Did you manage that?

80
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,280
My friend said if that's the case,

81
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,040
you'll be considered
an accomplice in this murder.

82
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
Whatever, Mom.

83
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,720
Pu won't drag me into all the trouble

84
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,760
because I'm pregnant with his child.

85
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,919
Let's hope that's really the case.

86
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Even if he betrays me,

87
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
I can just say that
I'd been threatened into doing it.

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
And I needed to do it for my child's sake.

89
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,840
If Ploysaeng was bailed like this,

90
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,120
she'll definitely find
the evidence to defend the case.

91
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,360
Just be careful.

92
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
Let's worry about that later.

93
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,640
It's time to make our move now.

94
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
And what do I have to do?

95
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,720
The CCTV footage
has so many weird details.

96
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,120
That's right.

97
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,880
The other cameras were conveniently
broken so we have only one angle.

98
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,640
It's like the scene was set beforehand.

99
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
But the identical dress is bugging me.

100
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
That means

101
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,400
it has to be someone close to Ms. Ploy
to know the event date

102
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,880
and what she was going to wear.

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
I saw Miss Dao at the dressmaker's

104
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
when I went
to pick up this dress for Ms. Ploy.

105
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
Should we go ask the shop?

106
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,680
- Yes.
- Let's go.

107
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
There's only one.

108
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
Ms. Ploy personally
picked the design and fabric herself.

109
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,400
I made it for her by order.

110
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
Can this dress be bought anywhere else?

111
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,600
There are some with similar designs.

112
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
But for the details,

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm sure that dress
can't be found anywhere else.

114
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,280
Do you remember
all the details about this dress?

115
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Of course.

116
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,440
I made it with my own hands.

117
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,120
Right.

118
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,480
And why was Miss Dao here the other day?

119
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,400
Ah, she was looking to
order a maternity dress.

120
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,200
She asked to take a look
at Ms. Ploy's dress as well.

121
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,200
She said it was beautiful
and took some photos of it.

122
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh, and she asked
for the dress pattern design too.

123
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,680
What was she going to do with it?

124
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,200
She said she wanted to have

125
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,120
matching dresses with Ms. Ploy for events.

126
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,840
But I couldn't make it in time,

127
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,800
so she took
the design to the other tailors.

128
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,040
PANALEE KIATTHARNTHONG

129
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Her family went bankrupt

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
and she has nothing.

131
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,480
She's with you for money!

132
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
She doesn't even actually love you!

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,040
She tricked you! Don't you see?!

134
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,840
She tricked you!

135
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,520
MAKKHAWAN RANGSAN BALLROOM

136
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
You have the courage to face me now?

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
Why wouldn't I?

138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,560
Shameless.

139
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,760
Still better than a whining loser.

140
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
You took my fiancé from me!

141
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,520
You destroyed my life!

142
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,840
I'll kill you, Ploysaeng!

143
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,400
How could you do this to me?!

144
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,200
How could you?!

145
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,720
When Aran was alive,

146
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,160
you already took him for yourself.

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,360
Now that only his ashes remain,

148
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
can't I be the only one
to give him flowers for once?

149
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,320
Please forgive me, Panalee.

150
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,920
I hope your soul

151
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,400
finds a better place to be.

152
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,160
This is the best I can do for you, Lee.

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,160
You loved Aran the most.

154
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,720
You deserve to be next to him.

155
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,160
In your next lives,

156
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,680
I hope you are fulfilled
with the love you want.

157
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,600
ARAN KITCHAPHINAN

158
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,400
PANALEE KIATTHARNTHONG

159
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,040
Where have you been?
Why did you turn off the phone?

160
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,920
I thought you were dead.

161
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,920
Have some respect.

162
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Haven't you done enough bad things?

163
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,640
Where are you?

164
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,320
I'm practicing dharma to cleanse my sins.

165
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
Do you think that will help?

166
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,960
It's better than doing nothing.

167
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,760
And you should make merits too,

168
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,600
so the karma
won't catch up to you so fast.

169
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm not afraid of sins.
I'll think about it when I'm dead.

170
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,920
While I'm alive,

171
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
I'll just be the happiest I can be.

172
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,720
I won't do
anything like this for you again.

173
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,920
Everything has ended.

174
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,400
I won't need you to do anything anymore.

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,720
<i>Ms. Ploy is now gathering</i>
<i>the evidence for the case.</i>

176
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,560
You should hide
at your mom's house for now.

177
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
I'll send you money.

178
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,800
If I don't tell you
to come back, then don't.

179
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
<i>Do you understand?</i>

180
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,360
Do you understand?

181
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes…

182
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,160
That's all.

183
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
Hup.

184
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah.

185
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Our mall's advertising costs
have decreased by a lot.

186
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,880
Was it because we now have
Tharnthong Market as an ally?

187
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
That can't be it.

188
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,680
A cup of cold homemade coffee, my lady.

189
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,280
It'll wake you up, get rid of all
the stress, and boost your brain.

190
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
If it's this good, you should open a cafe.

191
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
Well, try it first.

192
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,040
So rich and tasty.

193
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,680
The barista felt down for a second.

194
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,440
A tip would help.

195
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,360
Huh?

196
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,200
Alright.

197
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,560
It's Chawee.

198
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's save it for later.

199
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
- Yes, Chawee?
- <i>Where are you, Miang?</i>

200
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm working at Parit's house.

201
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
<i>Come back home now.</i>

202
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,160
Why?

203
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,760
<i>Miss Dao and Mr. Kanta</i>
<i>brought a lawyer here</i>

204
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,160
<i>to sue Ms. Ploy. Come home quick.</i>

205
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,680
Right. I'll come back now.

206
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,119
What happened?

207
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm representing Miss Darinkarn

208
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,040
in our negotiation to have you

209
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,440
transfer the authority of AR Construction

210
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,079
which is the inheritance from Mr. Aran

211
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
back to Miss Darinkarn.

212
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,319
Mr. Aran might have written the will

213
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
no one has ever seen

214
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,400
to let you take care
of the company in his stead

215
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,280
until you see fit to return it to Dao.

216
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,600
That's because Dao

217
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,400
was just a student back then

218
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,000
and you, yourself,
were trustworthy enough.

219
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,240
But now everything has changed.

220
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
Is that correct?

221
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,480
Yes.

222
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,760
You're now accused of a serious charge

223
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,520
which affects your reputation.

224
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
So, Miss Darinkarn would like you

225
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,280
to return AR Construction

226
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,600
back to her.

227
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
Chawee. How was it?

228
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,520
They're negotiating.

229
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Miss Dao insists
on having her dad's company back.

230
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,680
They're now ganging up on her.

231
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,720
I don't know if she can handle
that foul-mouthed mother and daughter.

232
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
- Miang.
- You can let her go.

233
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,720
Let Miang get in there.

234
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,240
Was this your idea?

235
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
Or did someone tell you to do it?

236
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,640
No matter whose idea it is,

237
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,840
you should return it to Dao now.

238
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,360
Because before long,

239
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,400
you'll be in jail for murder.

240
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
She'll never be in jail…

241
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,280
since she didn't kill anyone.

242
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
You should know that
better than anyone, Miss Dao.

243
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
Watch your mouth.
I can just sue you for defamation.

244
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
The reason you always speak up for her

245
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,160
must be from your misunderstanding

246
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,520
that you'll get some inheritance too.

247
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,640
You're protecting the wrong person.

248
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,680
And this doesn't concern you.
Get out of here.

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,200
Just let her hear the crimes of her boss.

250
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,400
Dao and I have been to Mr. Aran's company.

251
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,920
The company has closed down

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,760
and has been turned
into some kind of export company.

253
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,920
Where did you move his company to?

254
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,160
Tell us now.

255
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
You don't want to return it

256
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,600
because you stole the company's money

257
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,920
and transferred it
to your own account, do you?

258
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
What about you?

259
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
Miang.

260
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,520
It's okay.
Just let her babble all she wants.

261
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
Because no matter what they say,

262
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,160
I still have the same answer.

263
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,080
I won't return it.

264
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
Why, Aunt Ploy? I want to know the reason.

265
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
Every question, every reason needed,

266
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,160
I'll tell in court.

267
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,080
You're just doing it to buy time.

268
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,000
You plan to keep it
for yourself in the end, don't you?

269
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,560
Just as I thought.

270
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,800
We were right to bring a lawyer here.

271
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,640
If you don't agree to do as requested,

272
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Miss Darinkarn will have to sue you.

273
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,200
But I'm afraid it wouldn't be good
for the reputation of you

274
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,440
and AR Construction.

275
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,960
If possible, you should consider
talking this out in the family.

276
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,760
There's nothing more to talk about.

277
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
If you're going to sue me,

278
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,400
then tell the lawyer
to prepare the documents.

279
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,080
I knew it. Someone like you
can't be trusted.

280
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
Miang. See the guests out for me.

281
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,680
- You…
- Time to leave.

282
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,840
The host no longer wants to talk.
Why are you still here?

283
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,120
Or do I need a lawyer to talk to you?

284
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,760
You crazy bitch.

285
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,080
Your boss won't be
let off the hook this time.

286
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,640
Prepare to find a new place to stay.

287
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,280
Who will really be in trouble?

288
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
I think the liars are more likely

289
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
to be homeless.

290
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,480
Worry about yourself.

291
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,120
If Aunt Ploy goes to jail,

292
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll fire every single one of you.

293
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,760
Let’s see how long
you can keep talking like that.

294
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,280
How could you change so easily overnight?

295
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,320
When Ms. Ploy is in a legal battle,

296
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,080
you're suddenly
going to sue her for the company.

297
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
Where did all the love

298
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
and attention go?

299
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,760
They didn't go anywhere, Miang.
They didn't even exist.

300
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,640
She was just fooling everyone.

301
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,120
Isn't it too late to realize it now?

302
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,400
Do you really think
no one has seen through you?

303
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Everyone tried to give you
a chance to rethink, but it was pointless.

304
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,800
It might be pointless for everyone else,

305
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,200
but not for me.

306
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
If I didn't act like a good stepdaughter,

307
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,200
would Aunt Ploy really be tricked

308
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,920
into transferring me
the cash in Dad's account.

309
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Why is your head full of benefits

310
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
and money like this?

311
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,360
Why don't you think about our bond?

312
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,480
Because Aunt Ploy never loved me.

313
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,280
No matter how good I was.

314
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,040
She might even love you more than me.

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,960
Aunt Ploy really cares about you, Dao.

316
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,280
Don't you see that she always
forgives your countless mistakes?

317
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,320
Why do you keep telling me off?

318
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,360
Can't you see that
Aunt Ploy was pretending as well?

319
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,560
She pretended to be nice to me

320
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,320
to keep Dad's company to herself.

321
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,080
You're such an ungrateful person.

322
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
And you're so stupid,

323
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,800
you can't even see
who really cares about you.

324
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,120
Miang!

325
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,320
I don't understand.

326
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,000
You came up with all these plans

327
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,480
just to get your inheritance back?
That's it?

328
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,800
What more do I want?

329
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,120
The love from Aunt Ploy?

330
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
She's not even related to me.

331
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,120
Why would she love me?

332
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,920
Even my real mother

333
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,160
wants only money from me.

334
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,280
I wasn't born from the love of anyone.

335
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,880
No one loves me, not even you.

336
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,600
My true love is my inheritance.

337
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,320
My dad's company is mine.

338
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,800
Dad gave it to me

339
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,760
but Aunt Ploy took it from me,
so I had to take it back!

340
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,360
It was the right thing to do!

341
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
And if you have everything back,

342
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,600
what will you do next?

343
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,760
I'll just get away from here,

344
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,160
so all of you will finally be happy.

345
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,320
You'll be able to marry someone you love.

346
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,800
Everything will come to an end.
Everyone will be happy.

347
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,560
All these complicated things

348
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,240
are from the dishonesty

349
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,720
and greed of Aunt Ploy alone.

350
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,920
She's too far gone.

351
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
She's the bane of Ms. Ploy's life.

352
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,880
Why didn't Ms. Ploy
just return the company to Miss Dao

353
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,920
and end everything?

354
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,240
I think there's something fishy
about Mr. Aran's construction company.

355
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
What about it?

356
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,400
We still have time. I'll take you there.

357
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,320
Where are you two going?

358
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,280
- We'll be right back.
- I'll be back, Chawee.

359
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,520
Where are you going?

360
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,560
Are you home yet, Ms. Ploy?

361
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,000
<i>I arrived a while ago.</i>

362
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,520
<i>You didn't answer,</i>
<i>so I thought you were driving.</i>

363
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
I had a little problem at home.

364
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Should we have dinner together?

365
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,080
Since the incident,
we've not had time for a meal together.

366
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,280
Would it be okay?
I still have a case open against me.

367
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm sure you didn't do it.

368
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,360
Thank you.

369
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
For your peace of mind,

370
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,400
would you like to have dinner at my house?

371
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,240
Fine. At the condo, right?

372
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,320
I meant Ms. Lee's house.

373
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,320
<i>From now on,</i>

374
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,960
this house is the perk of my position.

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,600
Then, can we do it around 5 p.m.?

376
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't want to come home late.

377
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
Okay.

378
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
Let's meet at 5 p.m.

379
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I miss you.

380
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,800
Is it here?

381
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,520
It's here, AR Construction.

382
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,600
I thought it would be

383
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,200
a tall luxurious building
in the middle of the city.

384
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,120
You'll be even more surprised
when you see the inside.

385
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,720
Shall we go?

386
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
How is it?

387
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
Well, are you surprised?

388
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,880
Oh?

389
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,840
We're closed now.

390
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
What?

391
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,080
But we're here now.
Can we talk a little bit?

392
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,800
You've been here before.

393
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Right.

394
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,320
But I'm here with my girlfriend today.

395
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,040
We want to build our marriage home.

396
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,720
As I told you last time,

397
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,680
we'll have a long queue
of projects for a long time.

398
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,560
It's fine. We can wait.

399
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,960
Do you have any house designs
that your company used to build?

400
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,600
Um…

401
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,920
Don't tell me you don't have any.

402
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,440
You have a lot of
projects throughout the year.

403
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,440
Uh, I'm still new here,

404
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,480
so I'm not sure
where they keep all the plans.

405
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
I'll try to find them for you.

406
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,320
- Right.
- Thank you.

407
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,000
Uh, didn't you want to go to the restroom?

408
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,360
Oh, right.

409
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,120
Can I use the restroom? This way?

410
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,800
- Miss…
- So, will I get to see the designs?

411
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,200
- Yes.
- Sorry to bother you.

412
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
I'll wait around here then.

413
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
AR Construction?

414
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Why does it all look like this?

415
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
Whoa. They're so busy,
there's dust everywhere.

416
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
Did you find the restroom, Miss?

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,320
I found it.

418
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,800
This way, please, Ms. Ploy.

419
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,720
Please wait here in the guest area.
Mr. Pu is coming down.

420
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,280
Thank you.

421
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,680
How could you do this to me?!

422
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,600
Have you been waiting long?

423
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,840
I'm seeing a lot of changes.

424
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,200
Me, or the house?

425
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
Both.

426
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,160
Shall we go to the dining table?

427
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Please.

428
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,080
Please forgive me.

429
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,640
I really don't know where they store
all the design catalogs.

430
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,840
Also, we're about to
move into the new office.

431
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,640
It's all fine.

432
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,160
At least I was able to use the restroom.

433
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
So, are you all moving out?

434
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,080
- Yes.
- Where will the new office be?

435
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,800
I have no idea.

436
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,360
Everything is all packed up, and you still
don't know where the new office is?

437
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,720
I'm sorry.

438
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,200
It’s past our operating time now.
I have to close the building for today.

439
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,560
It's okay. Let's head back, then.

440
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,000
We'll stop by again later.

441
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,800
Please don't move out so soon.

442
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,320
Right.

443
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,840
We'll take our leave now.

444
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,920
Let's go.

445
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,960
That man stopped by again, Ms. Ploy.

446
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,880
He was here with his girlfriend.

447
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,840
I've turned the CCTV on.

448
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,200
Please feel free
to check through your phone.

449
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Yes.

450
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,280
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,520
Is everything okay?

452
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,040
Everything is okay.

453
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,720
Please.

454
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,360
Thank you.

455
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Is the food alright?

456
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,160
Very delicious.

457
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I hired a hotel chef
to cook for us in my kitchen.

458
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,840
You didn't need to do that.
I'm not a picky eater.

459
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,679
I did.

460
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,239
I wanted to impress you.

461
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,400
I'd like to make you happy

462
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
every time we see each other.

463
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,719
You told me that
something is troubling you.

464
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,239
It's about Dao again.

465
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,639
What did Miss Dao do this time?

466
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,920
She and her mom hired a lawyer to pressure
me into returning Aran's company to her.

467
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,600
They claimed that the murder of Panalee

468
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,120
would damage the company's credibility.

469
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,160
If she wants it so much,
I think you should let her have it.

470
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,680
So she won't cause
any more trouble for you.

471
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,400
It's not that easy.

472
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,040
Why is that?

473
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,280
Excuse me.

474
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,160
Uh, do you know
if AR Construction over there

475
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,920
has any ongoing construction projects?
They're closed every time I come.

476
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
How are they supposed to do any projects?
They have only one employee.

477
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,000
Are you talking about the receptionist?

478
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,840
Exactly. She's my friend's daughter.

479
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,720
She doesn't do anything

480
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
other than turn down clients.

481
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,280
They don't accept any projects?

482
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
The right question should be
if they ever accepted any project.

483
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,200
I'll tell you something.
I've been selling here

484
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
for almost three years.

485
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,760
They haven't constructed anything.

486
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,120
It’s obvious this company
is being used to launder money.

487
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
Thank you.

488
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you.

489
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,920
Nai said the same thing.

490
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,360
But I believe Aunt Ploy
would never do any illegal business.

491
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,600
That's right.

492
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
I think the company
might have run into some problems,

493
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,600
so she doesn't want
to give it to Miss Dao.

494
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,280
Mr. Aran went bankrupt?

495
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,880
It took only six years

496
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,040
for him to ask me
not to interfere with his business.

497
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,040
He didn't want to use Camellia's
connections to find more clients.

498
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,280
From a man's perspective,

499
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
I have an idea of how he must have felt.

500
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,760
It was his dignity.

501
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,480
No husband

502
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,920
would want his wife
to carry him all the time.

503
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,000
I get that.

504
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,400
And why did the company collapse so fast?

505
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,960
Arun wasn’t able to win
the contract for any major projects.

506
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,360
He recklessly
invested the money in stocks.

507
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,880
When he lost the money,

508
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,560
he took the company's working capital

509
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,760
and invested in new stocks
thinking it would even out the profit.

510
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,160
Unsurprisingly,

511
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,240
he lost more and went bankrupt.

512
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,240
Didn't you offer to help?

513
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,560
I found out about it
when Aran put our house up for sale.

514
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,640
So, I had to secretly buy the house
with my own money.

515
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,400
No one knew

516
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,560
that I’m more than ten times
wealthier than Aran.

517
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,200
Camellia Market

518
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,720
kept growing and successfully
opened branches abroad.

519
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,560
Aran didn't have anything left,

520
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,520
other than a false public image.

521
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Every penny of expenses in our house

522
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,280
came out of my wallet.

523
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,200
Then how has the company

524
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
remained open to this day?

525
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,400
Aran

526
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,920
feared that everyone would realize
he was not the genius they thought he was.

527
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,520
He feared being mocked.

528
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
And what he feared most was that Dao,

529
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,400
who viewed him as her hero,

530
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,120
would be disappointed in him.

531
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,560
He passed away suddenly from an accident.

532
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,600
He never wrote a will.

533
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,040
So, I needed to do everything
to honor his memory.

534
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Does that mean

535
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,920
the will

536
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,440
was fabricated by you?

537
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
Yes.

538
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,600
If I hadn't done it,

539
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,440
everyone would have known
Aran's secret a long time ago.

540
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
So, I needed to jump in and take care of

541
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,520
AR Construction
to prevent it from collapsing.

542
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,520
It's a construction company
which is not my expertise.

543
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,160
I could only help maintain it
so it wouldn't close down.

544
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,840
So, the inheritance
that is the cash in the account

545
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,160
that you gave Miss Dao was…

546
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
It was my money.

547
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,360
So that's why

548
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,120
you didn't agree
to return the company to Miss Dao.

549
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,600
I don't want Dao to know

550
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
that her beloved father,

551
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,360
the one she was most proud of,

552
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,600
didn't have any money left for her.

553
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,840
Not only money,

554
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,760
he didn't even have
any dignity or achievement.

555
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,720
Please don't be too hard on yourself.

556
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,320
You did your best, Ms. Ploy.

557
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,000
Someday,

558
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
Miss Dao will understand.

559
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
Where did you hide the gun?

560
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,520
I've had to adjust my plans.

561
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,920
You don't have to know.

562
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,920
Where is the gun?

563
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,640
Please come in.

564
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,480
Well,

565
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,040
when Miang comes,
please hide in my bedroom.

566
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,640
- Would you like any drinks?
- Just some water.

567
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,080
Alright. You can take a seat.

568
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
It's a framed jigsaw puzzle.

569
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,600
Did you put it together yourself?

570
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,720
Yes. Here's your water.

571
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,200
Thank you.

572
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,160
You have a lot of patience.

573
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,400
And the heart is hollow like that?

574
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh.

575
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,960
That piece was lost.

576
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,680
Specifically inside the heart?

577
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,960
Yes.

578
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,520
Too bad. It's a pink heart.

579
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,440
It's as beautiful as a sapphire,
what your name means.

580
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,080
Please hide in my bedroom, Ms. Ploy.

581
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,640
Let's go.

582
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,560
What are you doing?

583
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,360
HBD, PARIT

584
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm sticking the heart piece onto it.

585
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,280
Next time,
please let me cook something for you.

586
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,440
Do you cook?

587
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,280
They must think I'm foolish enough

588
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,000
to be deceived
by a man I fell in love with.

589
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,800
I'm certain

590
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,920
that Ms. Ploy must have her reason
not to give it back to Miss Dao.

591
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,200
She wouldn't be greedy
and wants it for herself.

592
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,160
We can rule out money laundering.
She wouldn't do it.

593
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,360
It's Nai.

594
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,720
Nai.

595
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,720
Where are the documents?

596
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,160
I'm with Miang now.

597
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,360
Alright, I'll hurry. Bye.

598
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,320
What did Nai say?

599
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,720
He just got some secret documents of AR.

600
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,840
But they can be opened
only on his desktop at the office.

601
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,240
- Should we go now?
- Yeah.

602
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,560
Ma'am, check, please.

603
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,880
I found the gun.

604
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Did you wear gloves when you held the gun?

605
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,680
What about when you put it in this bag?

606
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,880
Very thoughtful of you.

607
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,200
That way,
we'll have the clear fingerprints

608
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,800
of the murderer.

609
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,400
Are you scared?

610
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,960
What the hell are you playing at?

611
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,160
Why did you go through my stuff?

612
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,480
I was just looking for some painkillers.

613
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,960
I'm sorry, Miss Dao.

614
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,800
You have nothing left.

615
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
You're not fit to be my bride.

616
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,160
Can you log in?

617
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,480
I'm in.

618
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,480
We're in, Danai.

619
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,960
Yes. Thank you.

620
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,160
Danai said to delete them after reading.

621
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,320
Okay.

622
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,800
Hold on.

623
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,720
FINANCE DOCUMENTS

624
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,160
INCOME OF 2020

625
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,920
INCOME OF 2020

626
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,400
CONTRACT FOR ONE-STORY BUILDING

627
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,480
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

628
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,360
AR CONSTRUCTION
WILL EMPLOY IATART CO., LTD…

629
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,360
CONSTRUCTION WITH INTERIOR DESIGN
FOR ONE BUILDING…

630
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,040
Have you found something?

631
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,880
Uh…

632
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,440
Aunt Ploy hired AR
for many construction projects,

633
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,600
and then AR hired other companies
to carry out those projects.

634
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,200
It basically survives on profit margin.

635
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,360
Looks like she's trying to
keep the company afloat.

636
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,640
Right?

637
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,800
Ms. Ploy.

638
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,560
I'm the one who sent
the secret documents from Aran's company

639
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,160
to Danai just a short while ago.

640
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,960
That means you know
that we're looking into this.

641
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,480
If Miss Dao found out about the company,

642
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,040
she would be very upset.

643
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,120
I told Puwin about this.

644
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,320
Why did you tell him?

645
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,440
I need to talk to you two about something.

646
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,280
Hello. Hello.

647
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,640
Mr. Puwin. This camera, please.

648
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,120
- Mr. Puwin. This one too.
- Look this way, please.

649
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,160
<i>Look this way, please.</i>

650
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,840
- <i>Smile, please.</i>
- <i>Please look this way.</i>

651
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,880
- <i>Again, please. Smile, Mr. Puwin.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

652
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,960
- <i>This camera, please.</i>
- <i>This one too.</i>

653
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,280
He chose to do a press conference
in the wake of Ms. Panalee's murder.

654
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,080
If not,
people wouldn’t be this interested.

655
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,720
Now he’s got his spotlight.

656
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,080
- Turn it off. I don't wanna watch anymore.
- Yes.

657
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,320
Puwin

658
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,760
is the one who benefits most
from Ms. Lee's death.

659
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,720
Why do the police not suspect him?

660
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,520
You're speaking without any evidence.

661
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,400
He can sue you for defamation.

662
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,840
Especially with how influential he is now.

663
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,960
A scumbag like you
won't be happy for long.

664
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,480
<i>Hello.</i>

665
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,320
<i>Welcome, all the press in this room.</i>

666
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,760
<i>I'd like to thank all of you</i>

667
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,520
<i>for attending the press conference today.</i>

668
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,360
You finally did it.

669
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,880
<i>Right now,</i>

670
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,280
<i>our Tharnthong Group family</i>

671
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,280
<i>is in mourning</i>

672
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,080
<i>after the passing of Ms. Panalee.</i>

673
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,000
<i>But the business must keep moving forward.</i>

674
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,040
I don't like you that much,

675
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,040
but love isn't my answer anymore.

676
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,560
You chose the right time to be born.

677
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,800
<i>The general meeting of Tharnthong Group</i>

678
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,760
<i>reached a unanimous decision</i>

679
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,280
<i>to appoint me</i>

680
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,040
<i>as the chief executive officer,</i>

681
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,520
<i>effective today.</i>

682
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,640
We're going to have a good life now.

683
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,480
<i>What are your strategies</i>
<i>for competing with your competitors?</i>

684
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,920
Good.

685
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,240
Right there too.

686
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
Miss.

687
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,440
- Miss. Can you take a look right here?
- Yes?

688
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,920
- What is it?
- This way, please.

689
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,400
- Right here.
- What's going on?

690
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,160
- Whose gun is this?
- I don't know either.

691
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,600
How did it end up here?

692
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,520
You saw Mr. Pu doing well

693
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,200
and want to change
your child's father now?

694
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,680
- Kwan?
- Who the hell is she?

695
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,560
I'll tell everyone the truth

696
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,720
that the two of us

697
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,000
are together.

698
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,240
What are the police doing here?

699
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,920
Maybe there are some developments
on Ms. Panalee's murder.

700
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Will you give
Dad's company back to me now?

701
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,120
I won't.

702
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,520
Why? Do you intend to take both my man

703
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,280
and my company for yourself?

704
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,600
<i>I did everything</i>

705
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,920
<i>for our family.</i>
