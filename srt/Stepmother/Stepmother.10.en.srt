1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,640
<i>The two of them</i>
<i>must have a deep relationship.</i>

2
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,680
You're making a mistake
by falling for this man.

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,640
Are you saying
I'm falling for a man that easily?!

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm afraid that's the case.

5
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,840
If that's what you think,

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,280
<i>I cannot stay here anymore.</i>

7
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,800
Miang!

8
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,680
From this moment on, I'm an outsider.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,120
You can't threaten me the way you used to.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,880
<i>If everything is exactly as we expect,</i>

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,800
they must be moving earlier than planned.

12
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,240
I want you to follow Miss Dao closely.

13
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
And I'll follow Mr. Pu.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,840
<i>Aran was not my first love,</i>

15
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,360
but I can proudly say
that we loved each other.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
It wasn't a one-sided love like yours.

17
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,560
There’s no mistake. It was Miang.

18
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Her? Buying a condo unit there?

19
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,440
She could be staying
in a monthly rental unit.

20
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Go check again

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,160
because if she's really there,

22
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,640
I won't be able to visit you like before.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
Or am I seeing things?

24
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
I’m not on board with that, Miang.

25
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,200
Choosing to stay
in the same condo as him is risky enough.

26
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
What would you do if he caught you?

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
If we don't take a risk,

28
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,640
how will we get closer to him?

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,560
Why are you being so stubborn?
I'm not comfortable with this.

30
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,360
I'll call you later.

31
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,560
Miang. Hello, Miang.

32
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t do this

33
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,040
I've already fallen too deeply for you.

34
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,640
Mr. Pu.

35
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
Please excuse me.

37
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
Was I convincing, Miang?

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,760
So convincing.

39
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,000
But a dead giveaway is your nails.

40
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm a real man with my nails done.
What's wrong with that?

41
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
They should have been longer.

42
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
That's enough.

43
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
They're beautiful though.

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,760
- Oh, Parit!
- Dao. Are you jogging?

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
Yeah. Can I join you?

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay. Let's go.

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
Your husband has been dead
for less than a month

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
and now you're aiming for a new man.

49
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Give me one week, and I'm sure

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,200
I'll beat you.

51
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Oh, bring it on. I'm always ready.

52
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,680
Let's go.

53
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Let's do a stretch.

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,680
It's refreshing to sweat sometimes.

55
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,000
Then you must find some time to exercise,

56
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
so you feel better.

57
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Then, when you go jogging,
please let me know.

58
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Okay.
So, I think this is enough for today.

59
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Right.

60
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,160
Do you want to walk or jog back home?

61
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,760
Let's walk.

62
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay. Let's go.

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
Dao!

64
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm sorry, Parit.

65
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Since you've been back here,

66
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
I've been rude to you.

67
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,480
It's okay. I understand that you did it
because of your feelings but…

68
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,000
Could you let go of me?
I'm all sweaty and stinky.

69
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm not smelling anything.

70
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,640
Dao. You're embarrassing us.

71
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,880
I'd like to stay like this for a while.

72
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,880
What do you want?

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
I want to make a deal with you.

74
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,800
And what is that?

75
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
Can't I come inside to talk?

76
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,320
I'll be in trouble
if my boyfriend sees me.

77
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,480
Your room looks cozy.

78
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,960
Go ahead and tell me what you want.
I have somewhere to go.

79
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,840
Is that a jigsaw puzzle?

80
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,280
You must have put in
a lot of effort to complete it.

81
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
Where's the piece inside the heart?

82
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,080
It's lost. Are you done?

83
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,640
Right.

84
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
What do you really want with me?

85
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,840
I'll only give you five more minutes.

86
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,280
Should we go jogging again tomorrow?

87
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm not sure if I'll have some work to do.

88
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,000
I plan to go to the office too.

89
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,040
So, we can talk about it later.

90
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,520
Of course.

91
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm so happy today, Parit.

92
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,680
It's like I'm a little girl again.

93
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,680
It's like when you were
my running coach for the sports day.

94
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,440
I should head home now.
I have some work to attend to.

95
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,160
Are you going anywhere today?

96
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,080
I don't think I am.

97
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,600
I'm home alone today. It's a relief
that you're not too far from me.

98
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,760
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

99
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,800
What are you planning to do?

100
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,400
I don't want you to tell anyone I'm here.

101
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,920
Why?

102
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,200
Do you have a secret?

103
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,080
You could call it a secret.

104
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,360
But I don’t want to be the gossip
of anyone in Ms. Ploy’s house.

105
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
Why?

106
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,680
Did you see the man
I was with in front of the elevator?

107
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,200
- Your boyfriend?
- Yes.

108
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,240
But he's someone else's husband.

109
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,920
I tried to leave the house for a long time
but couldn't find a good reason.

110
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,000
What he offered me
was too good to turn down.

111
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,000
I wouldn't be able to make that much
in my whole life.

112
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,320
You must be looking down on me and
wondering why I agreed to be a mistress.

113
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,360
But someone who has never been
an underling or experienced oppression

114
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,080
and emotional abuse like you

115
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,240
wouldn't understand anything I'm saying.

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm the daughter
of the driver at the company.

117
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,640
My mother died,

118
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
and my father is in jail
for running over and killing someone.

119
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,920
I had no one left.

120
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,320
Ms. Ploy felt bad for me and took me in.

121
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,480
But I didn't have any privilege.

122
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,560
No matter how good or grateful I was,

123
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,680
no matter what I did for her,

124
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
I could only be
an errand girl in the house.

125
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,120
That's enough.
I'm not interested in your history.

126
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,480
Here's the deal.

127
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,600
I won't say anything about you

128
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
and you won't say anything about me.

129
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,240
We stay in our own lane

130
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
and don't know each other.

131
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
Okay?

132
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,480
Please keep your word.

133
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,600
Stop pestering me
like you can't understand what I said.

134
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,200
The door's here.

135
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,080
I won't always stay a mistress.

136
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,400
I'll go much further
than where I am right now.

137
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,840
Nobody will look down on me again.

138
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,080
What is it, Miang? What do you want?

139
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
Do you know Mr. Puwin?

140
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,440
Of course. Yeah.

141
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,560
He's the boy Ms. Panalee took in
to compete against you. Why do you ask?

142
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,680
Well, his company is our competitor,

143
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,320
so I want to know more about him.

144
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,120
From what Ms. Ploy told me,

145
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,120
he might be a distant relative of Ms. Lee.

146
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
His family is poor,

147
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,600
so Ms. Lee took him in.

148
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,400
If I remember correctly,
Mr. Puwin's older sister

149
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,040
is also Ms. Ploy's friend.

150
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,960
That means she is also
friends with Ms. Lee.

151
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,600
Of course.

152
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,120
From what I've heard,
his life was really unfortunate.

153
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,320
Ms. Lee abused him all the time.

154
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,040
She didn't raise him with love
like Ms. Ploy did with you.

155
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Is Miang really renting
the same condo as you?

156
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,600
She might have been here just to
visit a friend. But she has left.

157
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
I thought so. She wouldn't
be able to afford that place.

158
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,160
Maybe some people won't stay poor forever.

159
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,720
But that's not the case for her.

160
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,920
She always shows off
without having anything to be proud of.

161
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,960
If Aunt Ploy hadn't taken her in,

162
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,480
<i>she wouldn't have had</i>
<i>any education or a proper job.</i>

163
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
She would have ended up
working on the streets.

164
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
Is there anything else?

165
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,200
I need to be somewhere.

166
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,520
Then, I can visit you
at your condo as usual, right?

167
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's not do that for now.

168
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,160
I'll make sure to see if she comes
to visit a friend again or not.

169
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,520
Then, we should stop
seeing each other for a while.

170
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,360
Good idea.

171
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,760
I'll be able to focus more
on our plan with Ms. Ploy that way.

172
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,480
Let's do that.

173
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,720
Talk to you later.

174
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,920
You were too hasty.

175
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
Did you think it through?

176
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
But someone died because of this, Parit.

177
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,920
<i>Waythus' death led to so many questions.</i>

178
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,360
<i>Maybe Miss Dao and Mr. Pu were involved.</i>

179
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,280
I can't be patient anymore.
I'm worried about Ms. Ploy.

180
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,400
<i>I understand that.</i>

181
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,520
<i>But don't you think</i>
<i>what you did was a bit too much?</i>

182
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,880
Why did you have to ruin your reputation
by acting like a mistress?

183
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Mr. Pu doesn't care about someone like me.

184
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Look at the people he likes.

185
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,480
Ms. Ploy. Miss Dao.
Both are beautiful and wealthy.

186
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,120
I'm nothing more than
a toy for him, at most.

187
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
But it's too risky, Miang.

188
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,200
Next time you want to do something,
you need to tell me first, alright?

189
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
If I told you,
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

190
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,160
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

191
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
You were so timid when I just came back.

192
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
I thought you wouldn't be
this reckless anymore.

193
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,760
That's why I need you to look out for me.

194
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't you dare make that face.

195
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,440
Puwin is smart, cunning even.

196
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,680
Do you really think
he won’t catch on to our game?

197
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,640
<i>No matter how smart,</i>
<i>cunning, or strong someone is,</i>

198
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,680
<i>they all have some weaknesses.</i>

199
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,240
I hope I've figured out what his is.

200
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,240
If you run into any problems,
think of me first, okay?

201
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,160
You can call me anytime. Don't hesitate.

202
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,680
My phone is always on.

203
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,520
Yes, sir.

204
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,040
I've already downloaded an app
for you to track my location.

205
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,080
You can always see where I am.

206
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,040
<i>What more do you want?</i>

207
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
<i>Oh, the only thing left</i>
<i>is having an all-day video call.</i>

208
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,640
I would do it if I could.

209
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
Don't challenge me. I'd do it.

210
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,600
Oh, Mr. Pu must be ready.

211
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm sure

212
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
he's going to the same event as Ms. Ploy.
I need to go.

213
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,280
Wait, Miang. Miang!

214
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Mr. Pu.

215
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
I told you to wait in the car.
Why are you here?

216
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,760
Ms. Lee always sends me to spy on you.

217
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,240
It wouldn't be a surprise to see me here.

218
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,720
Follow me.

219
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,640
What’s up with him?

220
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,800
If you want to talk about money,
you can just call.

221
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
You're saying it
like you pick up the calls.

222
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,840
You didn't even read my texts.

223
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
I'll transfer it now.

224
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,120
Is that all?

225
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
Why hasn't Miss Dao come down to eat?

226
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,800
What? Why is there only one dish?

227
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,640
Kaew.

228
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,880
Why is there just one dish here?

229
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,400
What? I've served
all the dishes on the table.

230
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,800
Come on, come on.

231
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,720
I had to eat alone at home today
and it sucks. So, let me eat with you.

232
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,280
Good thing you brought
some dishes with you.

233
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,040
Ouch.

234
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,200
I only have

235
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,520
a bowl of soup with beef.

236
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,680
Are you on a diet, Parit?

237
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Just a little bit.

238
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,280
Do you want some rice too?
I can call someone to bring it here.

239
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
It's okay. I've cooked it.

240
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Then, should I make an omelet too?

241
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,440
- It's my favorite.
- Wait for it a little bit then.

242
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
Mom.

243
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,200
Mom.

244
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,000
Why are you sleeping here like this?

245
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,920
Oh, you're back?

246
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,160
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow.

247
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
You should get a detailed checkup.

248
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Don't you bail on me this time.

249
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,240
I've driven all the way to take you there.

250
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,240
What a waste. Medical checkups
in Bangkok must be expensive.

251
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,960
It's fine. I can afford it.

252
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,520
This way, we will know for sure
why you are constantly unconscious.

253
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,400
Well, let's go upstairs.

254
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,880
You're single and live alone.
Don't you feel lonely?

255
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,920
No, I'm not really lonely.
I always do things I like.

256
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,760
And back when you were
living in the States,

257
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,360
did you have any girlfriends?

258
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,040
I had one. We worked at the same place.

259
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,080
But the relationship didn’t last long.

260
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Why not?

261
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,720
We had quite different values.

262
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,120
I think I prefer Thai girls.

263
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,960
That means I still have a chance, right?

264
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
Do you want to go home now?

265
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,160
No, I don't want to go yet.

266
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,200
I've brought some work home, so I…

267
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,880
Then do it. I won't bother you.

268
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,160
I'll go home when I feel like it.

269
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,640
- Uh…
- I'll wait out there then.

270
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,120
Are you going down?

271
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,240
Yes. I'm hungry,
so I'm looking for something to eat.

272
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,760
Please.

273
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
Would you like to go together?

274
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,200
Dao.

275
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Dao.

276
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,040
Dao.

277
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
Parit…

278
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,600
Aunt Ploy. Why are you here?

279
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,840
I'm here to talk to Parit about work.

280
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,640
And what are you doing?
Shouldn't you be at home?

281
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,880
I didn't want to be home alone.
It's lonely.

282
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,400
So…

283
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
What's going on?

284
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,440
You decided to work at Camellia? Really?

285
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,920
I'd like to give it a try.

286
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,520
That's good. Your interest in working
already made my day.

287
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,400
Let's go home.
You've been bothering him all day.

288
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,400
Then, I'll go home now, Parit.

289
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
Let's go jogging tomorrow.

290
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Wait for me in the car.

291
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,560
I have something to talk to Parit about.

292
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
Yes.

293
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,760
Sometimes we have to
make difficult decisions

294
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,600
for our peace of mind, don't you think?

295
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,320
Right.

296
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,840
This Friday

297
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,680
is my birthday
and I'll have a small party at home.

298
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,680
It’s only for the people closest to me.
You should come too.

299
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes, Aunt Ploy.

300
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,200
And don't buy me any presents.

301
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,520
I don't want any.

302
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,480
Right.

303
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,000
Tell Miang to come too.

304
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,960
Miang definitely remembers your birthday.

305
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
But it's up to her
whether she wants to come.

306
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,280
I understand.
Our breakup was pretty recent.

307
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,880
So, I think it's up to her.

308
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,840
Anyway…

309
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,480
Please give Miang this check.

310
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,400
If she's too stubborn to accept it,

311
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,920
you have to find a way
to make her keep it.

312
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,560
Yes, Aunt Ploy.

313
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,640
Moving somewhere else

314
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,280
will cost a lot of money.

315
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,080
And she doesn't have a new job yet.

316
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,520
This check
will cover the expenses for her.

317
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,200
Miang will be so happy

318
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,440
to know that you still care about her.

319
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,160
If you worry about Dao
as much as you worry about Miang,

320
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,080
I would be even more relieved.

321
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,440
Do you remember what I asked of you?

322
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
But I…

323
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,040
I'll leave now, so you can take some rest.

324
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,640
SILPTHANAKUL FAMILY

325
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,400
Where is she going?

326
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,920
Now she's not picking up my call.

327
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,040
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

328
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,920
I went out to have dinner

329
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
and left the phone in my car.

330
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,240
There are missed calls from me.
Why didn't you call me back?

331
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
You would scold me.

332
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,440
Who did you have dinner with?

333
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
Would you like to go together?

334
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,880
I'm in a bit of a hurry today,

335
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,720
so I'd rather eat alone. I'm sorry.

336
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,560
Sometimes I have to play hard to get

337
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,120
to make him want to win me over even more.

338
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,560
You're such a schemer.

339
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,480
Parit.

340
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,800
I have something to tell you.
Let's talk in my room.

341
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,240
Do you suspect that

342
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Nichamon is working with them too?

343
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
That's right.

344
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,600
And the fake customer
having a seizure during our festival

345
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,360
might have been something
Mr. Pu knew about.

346
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,320
So, he did that to impress Aunt Ploy.

347
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,080
That's what I thought.

348
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,880
Here.

349
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,880
I've learned where she lives.

350
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,400
I'll start from there.

351
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,240
You did it without telling me again.

352
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,200
We just talked about this.

353
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,560
But I wasn't risking anything.

354
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,360
Aunt Ploy asked me to give you this.

355
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,239
Have it, for Aunt Ploy's sake.

356
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,040
But I won't cash it.

357
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,920
If you want to find all the evidence
to catch them, you need a lot of money.

358
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,040
Think of it as the fund from Aunt Ploy
to help Aunt Ploy help herself.

359
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,719
In case of emergency.

360
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,239
This Friday is Aunt Ploy's birthday.

361
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,480
I remember.

362
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,239
She asked me to invite you to her party.

363
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,400
Are you her spokesperson now?

364
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,719
Well…

365
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,000
just a little bit.

366
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,680
What are you doing?

367
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm so sleepy and too tired to drive.
I'll go home tomorrow then.

368
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,760
I can tell you want to be here
to keep an eye on me.

369
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,040
Parit. You can't do that.

370
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,800
Get up.

371
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,560
You can't sleep here.

372
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,440
Mr. Pu is staying here tonight.

373
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I don't want him to suspect anything.
It would ruin my plan.

374
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,880
Then promise me

375
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,280
that you won't risk yourself again.

376
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,720
If you don't listen to me this time,
I'll be really upset.

377
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm scared now.

378
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,920
So, so scared.

379
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,080
Are you ready to go home?

380
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,080
Kiss my cheek, or I won’t have
the energy to drive home.

381
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,680
- There.
- Ouch.

382
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,840
That hurts.

383
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,160
Go home. It's not my fault
if you get to work late.

384
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,880
- Go home, Parit. Get up.
- Just a little longer.

385
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
Up.

386
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,000
Can't I be here a bit longer?

387
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,160
What's going on with you?

388
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,160
You're feeling guilty, aren't you?

389
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,160
You two lovebirds went jogging together

390
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,120
and even had dinner together.

391
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,320
Chawee told me all about it.

392
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,000
So you didn't pick up my call because…

393
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,360
you're jealous.

394
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,800
Not at all.

395
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
Parit.

396
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,560
I'd even be happy
if you loved Miss Dao back

397
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,000
and it makes her…

398
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,440
I told you not to think like that.

399
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,720
If you don't listen, I'll get my mom

400
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,960
to fly here so I can
propose to you right away.

401
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
Go home.

402
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,440
Leave now, Parit. I'll be on the lookout.

403
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,480
Get up now.

404
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,200
Should I get up?

405
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,520
Hurry up.

406
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,280
- Come on.
- Alright. Alright.

407
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,920
Go.

408
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,080
Can't I really be here--

409
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Now you have the energy to drive home.

410
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,680
Time to go.

411
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,160
Where is she going
so early in the morning?

412
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,080
The gate is unlocked.

413
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,600
That means she went somewhere
around here and will be back shortly.

414
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
Ma'am!

415
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,080
Ma'am!

416
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,720
Ma'am!

417
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,920
Ma'am.

418
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Ma'am.

419
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,520
What the hell should I do?

420
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,960
Let's hope she was calling
her daughter before she collapsed.

421
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,720
Who are you, dear?

422
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,200
I'm in the neighborhood.

423
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,920
I saw you lying still,
so I came to take a look.

424
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,360
What? Why was the gate left open?

425
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Mom!

426
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,520
Mom!

427
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,400
Did you lose consciousness again?

428
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,040
Are you okay? Try to get up.

429
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,160
Can you walk inside?

430
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,920
I told you not to go outside the house.

431
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,640
I can't just lie down all day.

432
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,120
You keep collapsing.
What would you do if you were home alone?

433
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,360
Parit. I've found important evidence.

434
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,480
What is it?

435
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Are you sure, Miang?

436
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
- I'm sorry, Chawee.
- Sorry.

437
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,960
It's fine.

438
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

439
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,280
Did Aunt Ploy come down?

440
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,280
She's getting ready upstairs.

441
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,680
Where should we hide Mr. Pu?

442
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
We're going to surprise Aunt Ploy today.

443
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,600
You can hide in the kitchen.
Ms. Ploy won't be here.

444
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,760
Then, please keep a lookout for us.

445
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,640
‪Right.

446
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,960
Let's go.

447
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,360
Listen. Miss Dao is having more fun
than the birthday person.

448
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,800
She's planning everything.
And she brought Mr. Pu for a surprise too.

449
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,080
Mr. Puwin is there as well?

450
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,080
<i>He dresses like a movie star.</i>

451
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,520
<i>Miang. Aren't you going to be here?</i>

452
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,920
If you were here, Ms. Ploy would be
even happier than if she saw Pu.

453
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,840
How many more times
do I need to go to court?

454
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,080
If you don't want to go, you can just
let the lawyer represent you.

455
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,600
That won't work.

456
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,960
I want to go see

457
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,360
and listen with my own eyes and ears.

458
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,280
When is this going to end?
I really want to go back to work.

459
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,600
I don't trust Pu.

460
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,040
The lawyer said that

461
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,160
it'll take about four to five months
for the trial court to make a ruling.

462
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,800
But if they decide to appeal,
it will be much longer.

463
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,920
Will Pu take my position forever?

464
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,440
Here's some water, ma'am.

465
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,320
- Thank you.
- Yes.

466
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,240
Where's Pu?

467
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,040
He went out somewhere.

468
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,160
Did you ask him where he was going?

469
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,400
No, ma'am.

470
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,480
Why can't you do what I asked?

471
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,320
I was afraid Mr. Pu would scold me.

472
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,720
You should be afraid of me!

473
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,360
Yes. I'm sorry, ma'am.

474
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,240
What was he wearing?

475
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,360
He was looking sharp in a full suit.

476
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,240
Where was he going?
There are no events anywhere.

477
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,840
- Oh?
- What?

478
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,280
Someone texted the inbox of our page

479
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,560
saying that Mr. Pu is going to
Ms. Ploysaeng's birthday party.

480
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,040
Pu.

481
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,480
But we don't know who it is.
It might just be a troll.

482
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,240
Then we need to see it for ourselves.

483
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,120
Come with me.

484
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,240
So, is the food alright?

485
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,640
It's far beyond alright.

486
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,040
Please clear the way! Please move!

487
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,000
Who invited you?

488
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,640
I wouldn't come even if you invited me.
I'm here for someone who works for me.

489
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,840
You're this old.

490
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,840
Learn to have some manners,
so the young will respect you.

491
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,320
I don't want any kids to respect me

492
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,520
because I don't prefer
younger men like you do.

493
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,440
Put that cake down
and come home with me right now

494
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,760
if you still want to be
the CEO of Tharnthong Group.

495
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,040
Put it down!

496
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,520
Sorry

497
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,920
for ruining your birthday wishes.

498
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,720
Unfortunately, today you won't have…

499
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
the cake.

500
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,760
- You brat!
- Ms. Lee!

501
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,920
- Pu!
- Stop!

502
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,960
Stop right there, Panalee.

503
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,880
Why?

504
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,800
You worried about
your sugar baby getting hurt?!

505
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,280
That's enough, Ms. Lee!

506
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,040
Let's talk at home.

507
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,360
That's right, Ms. Lee.

508
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,680
Let's not make this a bigger deal.

509
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
You're in the middle of a court battle.

510
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,840
If you're hit with another charge,
they'll label you violent

511
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,000
and prone to fights.

512
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,480
That won't be good for you.

513
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,200
Please don't leave any openings
for the other side.

514
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,840
It'll take longer
for your case to conclude.

515
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,240
Come home with me right now!

516
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,080
I'm so sorry

517
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,320
for causing trouble at your party.

518
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,400
It's not about you.
She's looking for a fight with me anyway.

519
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,120
I think you should go back
and talk things out with your boss.

520
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,720
Right.

521
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,640
My birthday surprise

522
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,120
was truly one of a kind.

523
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,400
Please help yourself to the food
since we'll need to order a new cake.

524
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,600
If I don't get to blow out the candles,

525
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,720
it feels like the mission isn't complete.

526
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,960
Dao. Could you order a new cake for me?

527
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,120
You can choose the one you want.

528
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,600
Got it.

529
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,600
I don’t know how Ms. Lee
found out that Mr. Pu was here.

530
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,320
Wait. Why don’t you seem surprised?

531
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,480
Don't tell me…

532
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,560
Yes.

533
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,520
I sent a message
to Tharnthong Market's page myself.

534
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,760
The admin worked really fast,
don’t you think?

535
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,440
But this is Aunt Ploy's birthday, Miang.
It shouldn't have been today.

536
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,360
It had to be today.

537
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,960
He shouldn't have had the chance to create
any more good memories with Ms. Ploy.

538
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,080
I needed to do this,

539
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,040
so Ms. Ploy wouldn't
want to meet him again.

540
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,760
I'm afraid
they will meet more often instead.

541
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,240
Why?

542
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,920
Because the outcome
is the opposite of what you wanted.

543
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,280
He not only created good memories

544
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,120
but also impressed Ms. Ploy
with his heroic actions.

545
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,160
I'll give it to him this time.

546
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,760
I will make Ms. Ploy see who he really is
behind the mask as soon as possible.

547
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,920
Talk to you later, Parit.

548
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,960
Miang. Hello?

549
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,360
Ma'am!

550
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,840
Are you feeling better?

551
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,760
Oh, it's you. Come inside, dear.

552
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,800
Right.

553
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,240
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

554
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,720
Those flowers are really beautiful.

555
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,960
Ah, those are hydrangeas.

556
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,360
My daughter really loves them. We have
them in our home in Phetchaburi too.

557
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,480
Are you from Phetchaburi?

558
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,560
Yes. I'll go back there tomorrow.

559
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,840
I miss my home so much.

560
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,200
My daughter brought me to see the doctor,
so she let me stay here for days.

561
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,760
I have a trip
to Phetchaburi this weekend too.

562
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,440
Really? Then you should come by
and have a meal at my house.

563
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,800
Is it difficult to go there?

564
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,440
Not at all. My house is in the city,

565
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,200
not much further
than a kindergarten school.

566
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,720
You'll see a 7-Eleven,
and my house is in that alley.

567
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,480
It's the second home on the right.
Not hard to find at all.

568
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,600
I'll stop by if I have enough time.

569
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,800
And what's the name
of the kindergarten school?

570
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,520
You haven't told me that.

571
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,840
Oh, it's…

572
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,680
Why do you think
I wouldn't catch on to your game?

573
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,720
You want to marry into money
to upgrade yourself.

574
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,880
You'll never succeed, Pu!

575
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,280
When I was in love with Jomkwan,

576
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,760
you forbade me

577
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,400
because she was poor, unsophisticated,
and not suited for me.

578
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,720
But now I'm interested in Ms. Ploy
who has everything,

579
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,920
you also oppose that decision.

580
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,120
Then who in the world can I love?

581
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,040
You can't love anyone!

582
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,400
You must repay me for what I did for you

583
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,000
and work for me until the day I die!

584
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
Okay.

585
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,320
That's clear.

586
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,480
You already know I despise Ploysaeng.

587
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,840
I allowed it at first
because I wanted to ruin her reputation.

588
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,480
But it seems like you two are
really in love now. I won't allow it!

589
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,720
I don't want to see Ploysaeng happy.

590
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,240
If I'm doing this for the land
to extend our market,

591
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,600
will it be worth allowing?

592
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,360
Don't you think
you're overestimating yourself?

593
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,040
Ploysaeng is not that stupid.

594
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,800
Love is a feeling.

595
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,960
There's no such thing
as being clever or stupid.

596
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,880
Don't you want Ms. Ploy's land

597
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,480
to extend our market to the north anymore?

598
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,360
I think there's a possibility.

599
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,000
It's more likely to succeed
than when we used Waythus.

600
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,040
I'll pretend I don't know about this then.

601
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,160
Thank you.

602
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,400
And for the seminar in Khao Yai,

603
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,400
to must try to get close
to Mr. Patchek to Mr. Phiphop.

604
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,480
Because they're now deciding
between investing in a new mall with us

605
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,240
or Camellia.

606
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,400
Strength and weakness
aren't that different.

607
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,360
The deciding factor
is which one they prefer more.

608
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,800
I want to win against Ploysaeng.

609
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,600
You must do anything
to make them invest in us.

610
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,240
I'll do my best.

611
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,520
I don't know who
Ploysaeng will send to the seminar.

612
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,880
You're right on time, Parit.

613
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,080
Oh, do you want to be in your car?
I'll drive it for you.

614
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,880
No, I'd rather go in your car.

615
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,120
Alright.
Then, please put them in the trunk.

616
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,360
Take care of her for me, Parit.

617
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,040
Of course, Aunt Ploy. Then, we'll go now.

618
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,680
- Goodbye.
- Drive safely.

619
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,280
- Goodbye, Chawee.
- Goodbye.

620
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,080
Let's go, Dao.

621
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,280
I'll head off now.

622
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,880
Miss Dao looks a lot more cheerful.

623
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,760
Love can change people.

624
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,600
It can also change them for the worse.

625
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,800
But that shouldn't be the case with Dao.

626
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,560
When was the last time
you saw Dao this bubbly?

627
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,440
I can only think of her screams.

628
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,000
It's exactly what I thought.

629
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,520
Dao was looking for love

630
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,080
and Parit is here
to fulfill what she needs perfectly.

631
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,640
If Mr. Parit really likes Miss Dao,

632
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
I feel bad for my Miang.

633
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,200
Surprisingly,
I'm not so worried about Miang.

634
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,040
Adorable young women like her
are well-liked by everyone.

635
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,320
She can find someone as good as Parit

636
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,440
or even better than him easily.

637
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,160
That's true.

638
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,360
Other than Parit,

639
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,440
no one would be able to handle Miss Dao.

640
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,240
Her redemption this time

641
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,320
might not be fake as you think.

642
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,400
Right.

643
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,320
That's it.

644
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,920
What are you looking at?

645
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,480
I've got some evidence with me

646
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,000
and really want you
to see it with your own eyes.

647
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,400
I'll tell Ms. Ploy
that you harassed Ms. Dao.

648
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,920
Do you want both
the daughter and the mother for yourself?

649
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,680
Watch your damn mouth.

650
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,360
Mr. Pu's been courting Ms. Ploy, my boss.

651
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,480
He's hitting on the mother
while currently dating her daughter.

652
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,880
I want to know more
about Mr. Pu and Miss Dao.

653
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,480
Keep in mind

654
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,040
that you're merely my figurehead.

655
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,800
<i>Let me clear things up just a bit longer</i>

656
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,960
and you'll have your long rest.

657
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,800
