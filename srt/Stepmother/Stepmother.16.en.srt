1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
You came up with all these plans

2
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,680
just to get your inheritance back?
That's it?

3
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,320
Dad gave it to me but Aunt Ploy took it
from me, so I had to take it back!

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>I think there's something fishy</i>
<i>about Mr. Aran's construction company.</i>

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,760
INCOME OF 2020

6
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Have you found something?

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,600
<i>I had to adjust my plans quickly.</i>
<i>Did you wear gloves when you held the gun?</i>

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Very thoughtful of you. That way,
we'll have the clear fingerprints

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
of the murderer.

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,880
<i>The general meeting of Tharnthong Group</i>
<i>reached a unanimous decision</i>

11
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,880
<i>to appoint me</i>
<i>as the Chief Executive Officer,</i>

12
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,840
<i>effective today.</i>

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,160
A scumbag like you
won't be happy for long.

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,520
You chose the right time to be born.

15
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
Please come in.

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,880
Parit. Did you hear the news?

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,120
What news?

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
If it's about Puwin, I'm sick of it.

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
No,

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
but he might be involved.

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,760
They found the gun used to murder Ms. Lee.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
Where?

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Ms. Lee's backyard.

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
They found it all of a sudden?

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
Yes.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,880
They picked the right time.

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
That's true.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,840
The police are running
a fingerprint analysis now.

29
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,040
We might know who the suspect is in a bit.

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,280
Who found the gun?! How did they find it?

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Why are they so sloppy?! How could
they leave the gun at the victim's house?!

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,960
Are they crazy?!
What did they think they were doing?

33
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,320
How am I supposed to know, Mom?

34
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
I couldn't reach Pu.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,400
He's an important person now, isn't he?
News about him is on every platform.

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
But the most important question is,

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,400
are you really not the one who shot Lee?

38
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,080
Mom. I told you I didn't do it.

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,920
How many times do I have to tell you?!

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,080
Then good.

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,360
But did you touch that gun?
Have you held it?

42
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,839
Well?!

43
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,320
Mom. Can you stop interrogating me?

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,120
You must clear everything up with Pu.

45
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,000
Things are not going as planned now.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,440
He has to tell us
if there's any change of plan,

47
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,280
and not leave us anxious like this!

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,240
If he doesn't want to pick up my calls,

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
tomorrow I'll crash
his house blessing ceremony.

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
He has no idea what I’m capable of.

51
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Dao.

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Are you going to
the ceremony at Puwin's house?

53
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,200
Yes.

54
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
We should go together.

55
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,160
I'd rather not. It’s only going to be
uncomfortable for both of us.

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,640
It should be Ms. Ploy who says that.

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
And the one who has to shut up is you.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Miang. Leave her alone
if she doesn't want to go with us.

59
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
You'll know who cares about you the most.

60
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
Dao.

61
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,520
Are you attending Puwin's ceremony?

62
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,160
Yes.

63
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,760
Be careful around Puwin.

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,200
I have a hunch that he'll betray you.

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,040
What are you talking about? Betray?

66
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,160
I never invested in anything with him.

67
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,480
You've been listening
to Miang's stories too much.

68
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,960
I'll prove it to you.

69
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,560
Be careful with that.

70
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,000
Welcome, Miss Mon.

71
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Congratulations on your success.

72
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
What are you doing here?

73
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,520
I'm here to do my duty as your wife.

74
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Hey. That hurts.

75
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,640
I didn't tell you to come back.
Why did you?

76
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
Hey.

77
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Are you really going to cut me loose?

78
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,440
I did everything for you.

79
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
For who?

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
Miss Dao.

81
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,600
The people you should do everything for

82
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,040
are me and your child.

83
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,520
Shameless.

84
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,440
You told everyone
it's another man's child.

85
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,320
You saw Mr. Pu doing well

86
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
and want to change
your child's father now?

87
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
I really want to know

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
how many men have you been
sleeping with around the same time?

89
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
- You!
- Enough!

90
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,000
What is all this?

91
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,560
Kwan?

92
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,360
What are you doing here?!

93
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
Who the hell is she?

94
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,960
- Come here!
- Hey!

95
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't you see that I'm pregnant?

96
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,400
I see it!

97
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,800
Your tummy looks like it's about to burst.
Why did you show up?

98
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
And why are you here?

99
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,240
My reason is the same as yours.

100
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,520
Did pregnancy make you bolder?

101
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm doing it for my child.

102
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,880
Did your husband treat you that badly,
so you have to crawl back to Mr. Pu?

103
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Yes. He left me, so I had to come.

104
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Then you must have no idea

105
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
that Mr. Pu and I are married.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,040
Our ceremony went well

107
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,160
and wasn't crashed by Ms. Lee
like yours was.

108
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,040
Mr. Pu told me

109
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,760
it was necessary
to keep you around to do his bidding.

110
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,200
Without a marriage certificate,

111
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
we're the same.

112
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
Shameless!

113
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Go ahead. Say what you want.

114
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,840
I can handle it,

115
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,600
for Mr. Pu's son.

116
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
I don't believe you!

117
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm tired of your excuses.

118
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,760
I need a conclusion

119
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
that you'll choose me or those women,

120
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
including Aunt Ploy as well.

121
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,560
I'll definitely choose you.

122
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
We're about to have a child together.

123
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,480
And what about
that pregnant bitch outside?

124
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm not the father.

125
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
How can I trust your words?

126
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,280
I won't act heroic

127
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,000
and randomly
take responsibility like Parit.

128
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,200
Here. You need to calm down.

129
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,120
My legitimate wife

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,880
will eventually be you. Don't worry.

131
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,080
But as of now, my plan isn't complete.

132
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,640
What more do you need to complete it?
Ms. Lee is dead.

133
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,040
This house is now yours.

134
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,000
And you've been appointed

135
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,840
as the CEO.

136
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,840
What more do you want to take?

137
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,040
It's not for me.

138
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,160
But it's what you want.

139
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,120
You still haven't got
your father's company back, right?

140
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,680
No need to worry about that.

141
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm preparing to sue her.

142
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
No more pretending.

143
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
I'll tell everyone the truth

144
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,320
that the two of us are together.

145
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
Okay.

146
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,400
If you're that certain,

147
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,960
you can do it
after my house blessing ceremony.

148
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,160
Good.

149
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,160
Then all of your women
will realize it together.

150
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,200
Then,

151
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,680
please keep things peaceful for a while.

152
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,520
Don't start any problems yet.

153
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,760
I'd really like the ceremony to go well.

154
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,080
Then you should tell
those women not to pick a fight with me.

155
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
I don't need to control my anger.

156
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,040
I owe both of you an apology

157
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
for not believing you in the first place.

158
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,480
I understand you.

159
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,680
But to be honest,
all of that was hard to believe

160
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,000
because they were both so convincing.

161
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
I was disappointed in you for a while.

162
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,800
You think a man could cloud my judgment?

163
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,040
Well, a little bit.

164
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,920
It's unbelievable

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,560
how just a small pink heart piece

166
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,600
can reveal the truth.

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,720
You're also very perceptive.

168
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,840
Dao must be the one who put the puzzle
together, but took the heart piece

169
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
and stuck it on Parit's birthday card.

170
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
That's why

171
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,160
Puwin couldn't conceal
his reaction that day.

172
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,000
Miss Dao is quite sentimental too.

173
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,360
She didn't give her heart
to someone she didn't love.

174
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,640
But if Puwin is caught in your trap,

175
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,200
Dao will also be in trouble.

176
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,400
After you told him about the company,

177
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
the gun was found the next day.

178
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,960
He intended to save you
from being the suspect.

179
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,400
Now he realizes that
Dao isn't as rich as he thought,

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
he might be chasing you, as expected.

181
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,440
Miss Dao is pregnant with his child.

182
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
He might not do anything that cruel.

183
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,080
He can't be trusted, Miang.

184
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,240
Ms. Lee basically raised him,
and look what he did.

185
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,360
I want to warn Dao
to be more careful when dealing with him.

186
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,800
Right now,

187
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,600
there's only you

188
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,240
who Dao still listens to, Parit.

189
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,400
Actually, my mom can make Dao listen too.

190
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,200
That's true.
How could I forget about Ms. Maratee?

191
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,040
She's now traveling across Thailand
with her friends.

192
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
She might forget her home.

193
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,240
She's coming back.

194
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll tell Mom to talk to Dao.

195
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,240
Thank you.

196
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,160
Then, we should get going.

197
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,600
Right.

198
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,200
What is this, Dao?

199
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,640
You said only family
would attend the ceremony.

200
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,960
Then why are these strangers here?

201
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,880
And why do you think
you're a part of his family?

202
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm Dao's mother, that's why.

203
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
If your daughter can be here, I can too.

204
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,880
And if this is considered a privilege,
I should be the first to have it.

205
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,760
Oh, I just realized that allowing yourself
to get pregnant to try to snag a man

206
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
is considered a privilege.

207
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,640
All you need to do is be in bed with him.

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,720
But the one who was able to have
the wedding ceremony with him

209
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,240
is me alone.

210
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,040
Stop it.

211
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,680
Mr. Pu!

212
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,600
What is going on here?!

213
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm all confused now!

214
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,400
What are you confused about, granny?

215
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,599
All the women in this room are his.

216
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,160
It's up to him to choose
which one he wants to be with.

217
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,720
I won't choose anyone right now.

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Today is a good day.
I'd like to bless my house.

219
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Don't ruin the auspicious day for me.

220
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,920
Anyone I didn't invite here,

221
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,440
please leave.

222
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,560
Looks like it was only me
that was invited.

223
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,880
Are you intending

224
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,720
to steal both my man

225
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,000
and my daughter's, Ploysaeng?

226
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,640
Oh?

227
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,160
What's really going on
between Pu and Dao then?

228
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,480
Ms. Ploy should have let us in with her.

229
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,920
She might think you'll ruin her plan.

230
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,560
Parit.

231
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,120
What are the police doing here?

232
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,120
Did something happen inside?

233
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,840
Maybe there are some developments
on Ms. Panalee's murder.

234
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,880
We've come to this.

235
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,320
- Now, I'll just…
- Miss Dao.

236
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,480
I'll say it.

237
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,360
Say it.

238
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Go ahead and say everything.

239
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,800
Me and Mr. Pu…

240
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,320
Mr. Pu! Mr. Pu!

241
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,760
The police are here.

242
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,920
What's the matter, officer?

243
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
We've got a new piece of evidence,

244
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,160
so we'd like to investigate further.

245
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
Is Miss Darinkarn here, sir?

246
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
She's right here, officer.

247
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,360
You're charged with
the murder of Ms. Panalee.

248
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
But I didn't do it.

249
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Please give your statement
at the police station.

250
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,120
What statement?!

251
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
She said she didn't do it!

252
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,880
You have the right to remain silent.

253
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,160
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

254
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
Please.

255
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Call the lawyer for me.

256
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,200
Right.

257
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,080
After the ceremony, I'll be there.

258
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,240
Dao. Don't worry. I'll go with you.

259
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,400
Hello. We have a big problem.

260
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,560
Where are you? We need you right now.

261
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,920
One opponent down.

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
There's only you and me now.

263
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,400
We'll find out

264
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,520
who becomes the lady of this house.

265
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,080
Did you order a custom-made dress

266
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,000
identical to what Ms. Ploysaeng
was going to wear to the party?

267
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes.

268
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,240
Yes, Mr. Lawyer.

269
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,960
Dao is hiring the same lawyer

270
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,520
who's in charge of suing me
for Aran's company.

271
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>He's my junior from the college.</i>

272
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,560
<i>I'm quite familiar with him.</i>

273
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,520
Then,

274
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,920
can you ask him if Dao has been questioned

275
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,080
about ordering a custom-made dress
identical to my party dress?

276
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,120
Because she wouldn't tell me herself.

277
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,720
<i>Identical party dresses?</i>

278
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,120
<i>I don't have any info on this.</i>

279
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Why did they have to be identical?

280
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,440
I just wanted to surprise Aunt Ploy

281
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
by going to the party
in identical dresses.

282
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,200
Did Ms. Ploysaeng know about it?

283
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,720
It wouldn't be a surprise if she knew.

284
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,800
I just found out from Miang too.

285
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,520
She said that Dao secretly
ordered a dress to be made

286
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,960
identical to my party dress.

287
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
<i>From this information,</i>

288
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,800
<i>it looks like Miss Dao</i>
<i>has something to do with the murder.</i>

289
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,800
If that's the case,

290
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,440
how should I give
my statement regarding this?

291
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
Could you give me some suggestions?

292
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,240
Does Ms. Ploysaeng know about

293
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,640
your surprise plan now?

294
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,400
She must know about it by now,

295
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,920
but she might say she doesn't.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
Why?

297
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,240
Miss Dao is suing her
for company ownership.

298
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,960
She might give a statement

299
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,920
to discredit Miss Dao in some way.

300
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,360
That's right.
She's very upset with me right now.

301
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,760
And where's the identical dress
you ordered now?

302
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't know.

303
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,920
Ms. Ploy's tailor couldn't make another
for Miss Dao in time,

304
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
so she asked them for the design
and hired another tailor.

305
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,040
When she decided not to go to the party,

306
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,320
she then let the shop sell the dress.

307
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,240
As for the customer and the price,

308
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,720
I don't know anything about that.

309
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,600
But the price must have been high
since the shop hasn't contacted me again.

310
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,600
And why did you decide

311
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,080
not to go to the party with Ms. Ploysaeng?

312
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,360
I was upset

313
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,680
that she preferred going with her date.

314
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
Then,

315
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,360
what is the most severe sentence?

316
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,880
The death penalty?

317
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,800
I'll have to collect your fingerprints

318
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,320
as evidence for this case.

319
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,920
Right.

320
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm more worried about the gun
than the dress now,

321
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,800
since she can come up with
excuses about the dress.

322
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,280
But as for the gun,

323
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,840
if her fingerprints are on it,
she's done for.

324
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,720
Miss Dao probably
wouldn't dare to shoot anyone.

325
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,360
She's a terrible person,

326
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,480
but killing someone?

327
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
I don't think she could do it.

328
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,400
But someone could have
forged fake evidence

329
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,520
to frame Dao.

330
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,680
Did Dao come out of the room?

331
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
Not yet, Aunt Ploy.

332
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,800
Dao.

333
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,720
Is this your plan?!

334
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,880
You're framing Dao for your crime!

335
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,640
Are you using your brain at all?

336
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
Stop trying to make Dao hate me.

337
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,960
In a situation like this,

338
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,400
we need to work together to fix it.

339
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,760
Stop pretending.

340
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,840
Even if I'm sentenced to death,

341
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,760
I won't back down
on taking my company back.

342
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
You're acting like Ms. Ploy

343
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,160
hired someone to give
a false statement to frame you.

344
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,680
That's enough, Miang.
It's useless to say anything to them.

345
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,200
When you're done, come talk to me at home.

346
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
Don't do what she says. No need to talk.

347
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,400
Believe your mother
if you want to go to prison.

348
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,880
But if you listen to me,
you might survive.

349
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,360
Make your decision.

350
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,840
You potty mouth!

351
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Aunt Ploy really cares about you, Dao.

352
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,320
It's not too late to fix it now.

353
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,360
Don't listen to him!

354
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,120
They're all the same!

355
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,480
Get lost!

356
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,560
Do you want me to call a taxi now?

357
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,320
Didn't you drive here?

358
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,880
It's for you.

359
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,920
I'm from another province

360
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,160
and I'm near full-term.

361
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
I won't be able to go back right away.

362
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,600
Don't tell me

363
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
you're planning to stay here.

364
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,920
Mr. Pu allowed me to.

365
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,440
Is that true?

366
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
She's pregnant with my son.

367
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,320
Do you really believe

368
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,680
that you're the father of that child?

369
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,600
Watch out for a downfall at the end.

370
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,400
Mr. Pu knew I was pregnant

371
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
but wanted me to keep it a secret.

372
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,880
Now that Ms. Lee is gone,

373
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,920
there's no need to be secretive anymore.

374
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,480
You should leave.

375
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
Mr. Pu.

376
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,840
Don't make this harder for me.

377
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,280
I'll see you this evening.

378
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,080
Let's see if I'll get pregnant too.

379
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,200
I didn't have a chance to greet you, Kwan.

380
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
Did I hug you too tightly?

381
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,600
No.

382
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Our son was moving.

383
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,840
He must be very happy to see his father.

384
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,160
Careful.

385
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,760
From now on,

386
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,560
we don't have to be far apart anymore.

387
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,120
Well,

388
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,320
is that man still messing with you?

389
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
When I told him

390
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,480
you were the father of my child,

391
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,240
he left me.

392
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
You must have gone through a lot.

393
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,160
I've been waiting for this day, Pu.

394
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,720
I didn't care how hard it was.

395
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,880
I'm sorry.

396
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
You and our son

397
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,480
will never have a hard life again.

398
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
Let me clear things out
a little bit longer.

399
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,200
Everything…

400
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,880
is coming to an end.

401
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,720
Please hang in there.

402
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,200
Yes.

403
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,080
If they could prove that
Dao was an accomplice in this murder

404
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,640
and tried to frame me,

405
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
she wouldn't be off the hook.

406
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,280
What if she insists that she didn't know,

407
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,040
she was tricked, or she was
forced to do it? Would that work?

408
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,720
Then she must have the proof of all that.

409
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,360
So, will they call you in
for more questioning?

410
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,760
I intend to give
a statement in Dao's favor.

411
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,360
Are you going to give a false statement?

412
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,520
If it helps Dao get acquitted
of conspiracy charges,

413
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,960
I will do it.

414
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
I don't agree with that.

415
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,840
Me neither.

416
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,440
Do you want me to just sit here

417
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,120
and watch Dao get punished
without doing anything?

418
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,040
I can't do it.

419
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,800
Miss Dao caused every problem herself.

420
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,320
She should take responsibility.

421
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,960
If Dao is in jail
and I didn't risk anything to help her,

422
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,000
I would feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

423
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,160
And what if the fingerprints
on the gun belong to Dao?

424
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,400
Wouldn't you be in more trouble?

425
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,640
Get out if you're not a part of this.

426
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,240
Aunt Ploy wanted to talk to me alone.

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,240
Don’t be too kind
and help the guilty turn things around.

428
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,960
You'll only end up in trouble yourself.

429
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,920
Will you leave now?

430
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,560
Parit, take Miang outside.

431
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Yes, Aunt Ploy. Let's go, Miang.

432
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,520
You must not be too kind.

433
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Someone like her will never hesitate
to burn the bridges you built for her.

434
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
If you're going to say
I'm ungrateful, just say it.

435
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,080
No need to act all sophisticated,

436
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,640
since you're simply a lowlife.

437
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,680
Too bad I'm not Ms. Kanta's daughter.

438
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,600
Otherwise, I’d be a so-called
"sophisticated" woman like you.

439
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,320
- Miang!
- Dao!

440
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,440
Stop. That's enough.

441
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Miang.

442
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,360
Why won’t you listen to me now?

443
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Ploy,

444
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
but enough is enough.

445
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
Whenever Miss Dao gets into trouble,
you always defend her.

446
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,080
But this is too much.

447
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,440
That's enough, Miang. Come with me.

448
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,720
If you want to say something, then say it.

449
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,040
I have an appointment.

450
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,000
With your lover?

451
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,000
What?

452
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm talking about Puwin.

453
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,800
Miss Dao intended to hurt her
in any way possible

454
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,400
and she still thinks about helping her.

455
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,920
I don't understand Ms. Ploy at all.

456
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,880
Why would she need to be good
to someone who despises her that much?

457
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,440
She might want to see her change.

458
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,639
How many chances did we give her?

459
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,000
Someone like that will never change.

460
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,679
I won't let Ms. Ploy
give a false statement

461
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
just to defend Miss Dao.

462
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll never ever let that happen.

463
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,400
I think making her change is harder
than making her switch to our side.

464
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,239
If we can do that,
everything will be better.

465
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,679
That's true.

466
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Those women were all over Puwin.

467
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,960
This is the perfect time
to make her realize who he really is.

468
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,800
How long have you known about it?

469
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm probably the last one to know.

470
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,080
If I had believed
what Parit and Miang said from the start,

471
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,080
things wouldn't be this messy.

472
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,760
It's good that you know now.

473
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,120
And do you understand why I did all this?

474
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,920
If you had returned Dad's company to me,

475
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,720
this would've been over a long time ago.

476
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,800
No need to be dramatic.

477
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,520
I know you hate me.

478
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,200
You know because you saw it

479
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,480
and felt it,

480
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
or because of what your mother

481
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,000
and her family

482
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
always told you about me?

483
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
I really want to know.

484
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,040
After over ten years,
don't you feel anything at all?

485
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,720
Don't you feel any bond between us?

486
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Do you hate me so much

487
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,560
that you want me

488
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,840
to be sentenced for murder?

489
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,720
What's the point of asking that?

490
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,880
No matter what the answer is,

491
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,400
it's too late to change anything now.

492
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,200
Will you give
Dad's company back to me now?!

493
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,160
- I won't.
- Why?!

494
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,720
Do you intend to take both my man

495
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,480
and my company for yourself?!

496
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
How could you be this shameless?

497
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,960
Prepare a good excuse
to speak in court then.

498
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,680
I don't know how much longer
I can continue like this, Aran.

499
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,040
Move.

500
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Do you want to know that much

501
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,560
why Ms. Ploy
didn't return the company to you?

502
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,600
It's because the company went under.

503
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,440
Nonsense.

504
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,960
It's true.

505
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,120
It collapsed under
your father's management.

506
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,400
He left behind overwhelming debt
before he passed.

507
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,920
Ms. Ploy did everything to save it.

508
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,600
- Without her, it wouldn't still be around.
- Miang!

509
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,440
She's telling you the truth, Dao.

510
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
I have all the evidence.

511
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,080
Follow me home. I'll show it to you.

512
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,280
If it's not true,

513
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,480
you'll be in so much trouble.

514
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm sorry for revealing it, Ms. Ploy.

515
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,480
I can't handle it anymore.

516
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,680
- Sorry.
- Yes?

517
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,800
- Is that for this house?
- Yes.

518
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,360
Thank you.

519
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,680
Can I have one too?

520
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,160
I didn't eat anything all afternoon.
I'm starving.

521
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,160
I'll have one more
basil fried rice, Aunty.

522
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,440
Make it extra-sized, and cook it dry.

523
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
My boss is here.

524
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Tell someone to hang it at the gate.
I'll go get it.

525
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,520
Thank you.

526
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,040
Let's eat.

527
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,840
How are you going to trick me this time?

528
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,920
Why are you so negative?

529
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
With all those women in your house,

530
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
how can I trust you now?

531
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,400
You know full well
that everything was part of my plan.

532
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,480
Plan to win a high-society widow

533
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,120
and cast me, your lackey wife, aside?

534
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,720
What are you saying?

535
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Sit down.

536
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,800
Miss Dao is about to
tell everyone that she's my lover

537
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,680
and I'm the father of her child.

538
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,040
And do you think Ms. Ploy

539
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,680
would still want to see me?

540
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,880
As for Miss Dao,

541
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,400
she might be off the hook
for the identical dresses.

542
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,800
But when the analysis result
of the fingerprints on the gun is out,

543
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,640
there's no escape for her.

544
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,800
Are you okay with
your lover and child being punished?

545
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,800
Can you see now

546
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,120
that I choose you?

547
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

548
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,000
What about that big-bellied woman?

549
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,440
I'm not stupid enough
to blindly believe in first love.

550
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,520
When the child is born,
we'll do a DNA test.

551
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
And what if you're the father?

552
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Then I'll keep only the child.

553
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,120
For my wife,

554
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
I choose you.

555
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
How can I really believe you?

556
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,400
Well…

557
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,160
you can decide for yourself.

558
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,320
I'll get you some water.

559
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,000
If you are still not convinced,

560
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,360
I'll take you
to Mr. Aran's company sometime.

561
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,520
Did you look into this yourself?

562
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,120
Yes.

563
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,360
I was wondering why Aunt Ploy
didn't return the company to you

564
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,160
when Camellia is this big

565
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,640
and already made a huge profit.

566
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,040
Mr. Aran's company had been losing profit

567
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,120
and was in a lot of debt
even before he passed.

568
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,880
Then, Aunt Ploy took care of the debt and
started making a profit for the company.

569
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,000
But they've just
started making a profit not long ago.

570
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,840
Can this really be called profit?

571
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,640
Even a grilled pork stall
makes more money than this.

572
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,760
Construction is not her expertise, Dao.

573
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,520
And Aunt Ploy
didn't close down the company

574
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,000
because she didn't want to destroy
what makes you proud of your father.

575
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,840
As for the money
in the savings account that you got,

576
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
it is all Aunt Ploy's money.

577
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,440
And the yearly dividend you use…

578
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,720
That's enough, Parit.

579
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,920
I don't want to drown
in a debt of gratitude.

580
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,000
That's why I need you
to let your guard down

581
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
and really see who cares about you

582
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,360
without demanding anything in return.

583
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,560
Where did you get all this information?

584
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,560
I investigated it and Aunt Ploy caught me.

585
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,200
So, she admitted it.

586
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,680
She admitted it

587
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,240
and gave all this to you?

588
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,640
- Yes.
- How do we know if it's true?

589
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,720
These reports can be easily fabricated.
What a waste of my time.

590
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,840
But Nai and I have checked it, Dao.

591
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,600
These are all real.

592
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,480
Aunt Ploy did find all the clients for AR.

593
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,240
- Even little things…
- Enough, Parit.

594
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,000
I have an appointment. Got to go now.

595
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,480
Do you want
the presentation of evidence in court

596
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,280
that will prove Mr. Aran's incompetence
in front of everyone?

597
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
His investments in stocks have
caused the company to lose money

598
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,120
and Aunt Ploy had to pay off
all the debt to keep the business going.

599
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,800
Do you want to ruin your father's legacy

600
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,040
with your own hands?
Is that what you want?

601
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,560
It's okay if you don't believe me now.

602
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,760
But I don't want you
to stand against us anymore.

603
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,160
I want you to believe me just this once.

604
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
Please.

605
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Can you do it?

606
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,320
You look so familiar, Ms. Kwan.
It's like I've seen you before.

607
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,360
It's from the minimart
at the corner of the street.

608
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,720
Ms. Kwan! Ms. Kwan!

609
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,920
Ms. Kwan!

610
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,920
Hey.

611
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,640
I'm so happy

612
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,320
that the police have released you.

613
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,360
Aunt Ploy was bailed out too,
and why wouldn't I be?

614
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,560
Or did you not expect me to be bailed out?

615
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,040
What are you talking about?

616
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,960
Who would want
his lover and child to stay in prison?

617
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,880
It wouldn't end with just prison.

618
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,480
Premeditated murder
can lead to a death sentence.

619
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,120
Didn't you say
the case wouldn't be linked to me?

620
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,640
If you give a statement
as we prepared, it'll be fine.

621
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,920
Don't worry.

622
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,160
This lawyer is good.
You can leave it to him.

623
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,800
Anyway…

624
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,640
does Ms. Ploy know about us now?

625
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,360
Why?

626
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,360
You're afraid you'll lose my stepmother?

627
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,160
It's not like that.

628
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,920
I want to choose the correct game plan.

629
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,160
Whether she knows or not,

630
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,120
she wouldn't be stupid enough to date you.

631
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,680
Your house was full of women.

632
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,400
And someone like you

633
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,720
isn't even a prince
she would fight everyone for.

634
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,440
If she means nothing to us now,

635
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,400
why don't you move into this condo,

636
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,720
so I can visit you easily?

637
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,960
And why don't you
let me live in your house?

638
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,920
Do you want more dramas with those two?

639
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,400
You're pregnant.
Don't get yourself into trouble.

640
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,160
Let me clear things up
with both of them first.

641
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,200
And then you can move in like a lady.

642
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,680
I hope it's before our child is born.

643
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
My child, hang in there a little longer.

644
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,880
We're about to be living together.

645
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,720
I did everything for our family.

646
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,800
You'll have a good life

647
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,040
with everything you want.

648
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,480
You will have no less than anyone else.

649
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,680
No one saw you, right?

650
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,400
They won't know who I am anyway.

651
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,040
Good. Now it's time to get Ploy,

652
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,400
and scare my daughter just a little bit.

653
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:26,280
We'll lead Mr. Pu
to believe that Mon did it.

654
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,720
I hate that bitch so much.

655
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,840
We need to get rid of her first.

656
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,080
So,

657
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,880
when do you want me to do it?

658
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,000
As soon as possible.

659
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,880
Right.

660
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,360
Parit, the meal's ready.

661
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,320
Miang.

662
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,280
You pranked me again.

663
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,440
I didn't. I just wanted
to wake you up for a meal.

664
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,240
Who wakes people up like that?

665
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,240
This is how you do it.

666
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,440
- Parit.
- Here.

667
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,280
That's enough.

668
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,400
Parit.

669
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,680
- Mom!
- Teacher.

670
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,840
Didn't you say you'd be home tomorrow?

671
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,520
There was a change of plan.

672
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,640
Ow.

673
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
How was the trip, Mom?

674
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,600
You already forgot
about your son, didn't you?

675
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,600
I forgot about you,

676
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,840
or you forgot about me, really?

677
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,760
Hey, I was away for a bit

678
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,440
and what happened? It's all over the news.

679
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,240
I'll update you in a bit.

680
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,800
Please drink water and relax,

681
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,800
since you're our only hope now.

682
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,480
I tried to convince Dao

683
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,360
but she was still indecisive,
so it's hard to plan our next move.

684
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,200
But if you try
to reason with Dao too, I'm sure that

685
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,320
she'll see through
what the last boss is up to.

686
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,640
Why didn't you tell me what happened?

687
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,840
I told her not to.

688
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,000
I didn't want to disturb your work time.

689
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,360
Also, I wasn't hurt that much.

690
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,600
You can leave.

691
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,360
Yes, sir.

692
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,200
Where does it hurt?

693
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,560
It's my arm.

694
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,680
That arm?

695
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,080
Any pain in your abdomen?

696
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,360
No.

697
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,800
I looked around the backyard.
There are some firecracker shells.

698
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,200
It can't have been a gunshot.

699
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,400
That's a relief.

700
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,080
I thought someone would kill me.

701
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,400
I'm not relieved at all.

702
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,200
This must have been a warning.

703
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,840
They might do more next time.

704
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,800
Pu.

705
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,480
I think

706
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,640
I should keep my distance from you,

707
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,800
for the safety of our child.

708
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,280
Kwan.

709
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,120
Before having what we have now,

710
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,760
can you imagine how hard I've tried?

711
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,800
You can't give up this easily.

712
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,760
Don't you love me anymore?

713
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,080

00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
Do the police know
whose fingerprints they are?

715
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,120
Watch out!

716
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,200
Stay away from me

717
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,640
if you don't want to be
the third corpse in this house.

718
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,560
What should we do now?

719
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,640
You have to do it yourself.

I bought an Unadon for you,
from your favorite shop.

722
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,520
Good, I'm hungry.

723
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,560
<i>Where are you now, Dao?</i>

00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,760
At the condo, with Puwin.
