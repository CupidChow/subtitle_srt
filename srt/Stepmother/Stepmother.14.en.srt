1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
If you're hurt this much,

2
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,640
we should do something
to put them in a difficult situation.

3
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,680
What’s your idea?

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Keep it safe. Someday,

5
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,520
it will come in handy for you.

HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

7
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,680
You can't run away from me.

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,920
I'm the father of your child after all.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,560
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before the secret is out.</i>

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Where did you keep the rings, Dao?
Please show them to my mom.

11
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,080
Wow.

12
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
They're really lovely.
You have a good eye.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,560
I won't lose
my girlfriend and my child to him.

14
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,640
I don't want him as my son-in-law either!

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,440
If the groom is gone,

16
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
there will be no wedding.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,080
Wow.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Can I come in?

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,000
Please come in.

20
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,760
Oh, I'll change the bedsheets for you.

21
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
I already did that.

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,640
Who gave this to you?

23
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,800
It was Miang.

24
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,400
Does it look good?

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,760
What were you signaling to me
earlier today?

26
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,360
Is there more to your marriage
with Dao than it seems?

27
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes.

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,840
Can you tell me about it?

29
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm not the father of Dao's child.

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,440
I thought so.

31
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,560
And are you going to marry her

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,760
just because you feel bad
that the child will be fatherless?

33
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,400
Hey. Don't you think
you're sacrificing too much?

34
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,640
That child actually has a father.

35
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,280
- You know him?
- Yes.

36
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,000
And you've just met him.

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,760
It's the man named Puwin, who we were
eating with at Aunt Ploy's house.

38
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,680
And I was certain this wedding
would never happen, so I didn't tell you.

39
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm so sorry.

40
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,360
And does Ms. Ploy know about that?

41
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
Aunt Ploy didn't believe me and Miang

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
because now

43
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
she's dating Puwin.

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,200
I heard about it,
but I don't think I'll go.

45
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,000
<i>Why, Lee?</i>
<i>The reunion wouldn't be fun without you.</i>

46
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,000
What about the best female entrepreneur?

47
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
Did she respond to the invitation?

48
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,600
<i>She did.</i>

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,760
<i>That's why I'm asking you</i>
<i>if you really won't go.</i>

50
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Why? What are you trying to say?

51
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,840
<i>Ploysaeng noted that</i>
<i>she'd bring a plus one.</i>

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,640
<i>Insiders say that she might</i>
<i>introduce her young boyfriend to everyone.</i>

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
<i>Lee. Are you listening?</i>

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,360
<i>What are you going to do?</i>
<i>Did you change your mind and will come?</i>

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,720
Since you just promoted
the event highlights like that,

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,920
I would go even if I was sick
and had to carry an oxygen tank with me.

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
See you there.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,680
How dare you treat me
like I’m nothing, Pu.

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
You'll get what you wish for.

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
Yes, Mr. Pu. No problem at all.

61
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,920
I'll tell him to stand by at the spot.

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
Can I give him your number?

63
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,600
This number, right?

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Got it.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,800
Do you want me to get it done today?

66
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,240
Today is our best shot.

67
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,840
When you're done eating,
go wait for him at Camellia.

68
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
Let's add more beans.

69
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
Go ahead.

70
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
- More lime?
- The smell of fermented fish…

71
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,680
It's mouthwatering.
Wait, let me add the crabs first.

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,600
- Do you eat this?
- You can add all of it. Don't worry.

73
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
I won't hold back anymore.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,960
- Another one?
- Let's add another for the rich taste.

75
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,800
I wouldn't trade this for a steak.
Keep the fermented fish coming.

76
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
- Come on.
- Here.

77
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Give me another spoonful.

78
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
I'll give you two.

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,120
What’s all the excitement about?

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,840
Do you want to join
our Som Tum party, Dao?

81
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,240
I shouldn't.
I could have an upset stomach later.

82
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,200
I forgot that you're pregnant.

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,080
I bought these for nothing then.

84
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,040
It's alright. You can join us with those.

85
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
I'll put them on the dishes.

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,560
I didn't buy any for you.
I didn't know you were here.

87
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,240
That's okay.
I want to have teacher's Som Tum so bad.

88
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sure you'll ask for more.

89
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,360
I'll wait there then.

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
HBD, PARIT

91
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,040
MY HEART IS RIGHT HERE

92
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,600
What? Where did the heart go?

93
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,160
You don’t look as fresh as usual today.

94
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,600
I had something on my mind last night,
so I didn’t get much sleep.

95
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Then, please let me drive you to the event

96
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,080
and drop you off right there.

97
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,280
That way, you can sit back and relax.

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,960
- Thank you.
- Please.

99
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,200
HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGER
PARKING SPOT

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,560
How long was I asleep?

101
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,520
Just a while.

102
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,240
Where are we?

103
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,000
The parking lot of my condo.

104
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,720
There is still some time left,

105
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,960
so I decided to park here
for you to get some rest.

106
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Thank you so much. I feel better now.

107
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,400
Would you like to go have some coffee
in my room before going to the event?

108
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,280
We still have time.

109
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,920
That would be nice. But I'm not
bothering you too much, right?

110
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,560
I'm glad to do it.

111
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,560
Next time,
please let me cook something for you.

112
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
Do you cook?

113
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Well, if I didn't work at Tharnthong,

114
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,960
I would have been a chef.

115
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
If you put it that way,

116
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,200
I might have to find
some time to try your food.

117
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
Thank you.

118
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
With pleasure.

119
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,200
If you want to try anything,
you can put it on a list for me.

120
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,080
Thanks.

121
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,480
You seem more lively now.

122
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,080
Maybe that's because I've taken a nap.

123
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
Can I ask you

124
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
what was on your mind?

125
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
I've made a decision.

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm going to call off
Dao and Parit's wedding.

127
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Why?

128
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
I had a chance to talk to Ms. Maratee,

129
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,320
Parit's mother. She wasn’t entirely
on board with their marriage.

130
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,640
She doesn't believe
that Parit is the father?

131
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,160
She wants us to take a DNA test first,
to make sure it's fair to everyone.

132
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,240
This might be a bit insulting to Miss Dao.

133
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,400
Anyone would suspect it.

134
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
They weren't even dating,
and she suddenly got pregnant.

135
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,400
We're shocked.

136
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,720
Ms. Maratee doesn't live here,
so she must be even more shocked.

137
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,440
That's true.

138
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,240
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
- Uh…

139
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,240
But to be honest,

140
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
I somehow agree with that decision.

141
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,440
Sometimes we can't trust people we know.

142
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,680
He might not be the father,

143
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,680
but pretend to be for his own benefit.

144
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,840
There are so many cases
like that on the news.

145
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,440
Well, didn't Miss Dao
prepare many things for the wedding?

146
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,560
I heard that she's made
an appointment with a tailor.

147
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,720
That's right. I should tell Dao

148
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
to cancel the appointment.

149
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,560
You can't backtrack that easily!

150
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
I won't listen to any of that!

151
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
Why do we have to take the test

152
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,000
when Parit has confirmed
that he's the father?

153
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,040
What more do you want?

154
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
I've spent a day with her today.

155
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,240
If she didn't want me to marry Parit,

156
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,680
she would have told me directly!

157
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
I'll go ask her right now.

158
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,320
How was it?

159
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,600
Did she take it well?

160
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,960
She insists she'll have a wedding.

161
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
Please don't worry.

162
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,720
You did what you thought was best.

163
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,400
Let's go to the event.
I won't be able to stay long.

164
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
Right.

165
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,160
Hello.

166
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,480
Where are you?

167
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
Gas station. I'm about to do it.

168
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
- No need to do it anymore.
- Why?

169
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,160
It won't be necessary. Come back.

170
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
It's easy for you to say.
What about my payment?

171
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,440
I'll pay you half of it, okay?

172
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,640
It's not your time to die yet,
you lucky bastard.

173
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,560
What's up.

174
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,960
Did Miss Dao call you?

175
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,400
She didn't. Why?

176
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,040
Ms. Ploy called her and said that
she wanted to call off the wedding.

177
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,240
Really?

178
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,440
Wait. Why so? Do you know?

179
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,320
I couldn't hear it clearly.
But Miss Dao sounded really angry.

180
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,320
<i>She's going to talk to your mom.</i>

181
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,680
Weird. Why would Aunt Ploy want to cancel
it if she was the one organizing it?

182
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,200
Then, the plan
to expose Puwin would be ruined.

183
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,560
Let's talk when I'm home. Please go
take a look at Dao and Mom for me.

184
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,720
Right.

185
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,400
Why didn't you tell me to my face?

186
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
You don't want me to marry Parit?

187
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
Dao, calm down and listen to me.

188
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,760
If you're certain Parit is the father,
then there's no need to worry.

189
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
It's just a matter of time.
You will marry him anyway.

190
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
Then why would we have to wait?!

191
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,480
Or do you believe
that I didn't have only Parit?

192
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,800
Did someone
falsely accuse me behind my back?

193
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,000
If you're talking about me,
then the answer is no.

194
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
I don't believe you.

195
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,880
I don't believe that Parit is the father
either, but I didn't want to say it.

196
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,520
- Miang!
- Stop, Dao!

197
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,640
Don't use violence in here.
I don't like it!

198
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
You love her more than me.

199
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,720
Everyone loves Miang!

200
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,880
Not a single person wants me to be happy!

201
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,280
I… That's not it, Dao.

202
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
No one is stopping you
from marrying Parit.

203
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,720
We just have to wait
for a DNA test result. That's it.

204
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,960
I've prepared everything for the wedding!

205
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,200
It can all be postponed, right?
There's nothing to fear.

206
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,320
Or do you already know who the father is?

207
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,200
Fine. If this is what you want,

208
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,960
just don’t cry over it later.

209
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,120
Did you ask Ms. Ploy
to call off the wedding, teacher?

210
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
I didn't.

211
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,320
It was Ms. Ploy who asked me
to postpone the wedding.

212
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,160
You can't do this to me!

213
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,960
I feel guilty towards Ms. Maratee.

214
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,920
I don't understand.

215
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,760
I've been thinking about this.
I have to say that I'm not happy at all.

216
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,160
I was worried about you.
I wanted to help you.

217
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
But it's like we're just exploiting Parit.

218
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,520
How are we exploiting him
if he's willing to marry me?!

219
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
That's because he felt bad for you!

220
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
But he's the father of my child.

221
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Stop lying to everyone!

222
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,080
Parit told me everything.

223
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
What's really going on?

224
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,120
Ms. Ploy told Miss Dao that teacher
isn't on board with this marriage.

225
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,680
But teacher said
Ms. Ploy told her to say that.

226
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,440
Who started this? I'm confused now.

227
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,360
Could it be that
Aunt Ploy suspects something,

228
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,080
so she wants to
postpone the wedding until it's clear.

229
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,360
If only that were true.

230
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,400
Um.

231
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,320
Why do you seem to doubt it?

232
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,720
I don't know.

233
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Ms. Ploy and Puwin
are inseparable right now.

234
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,880
It's basically them announcing
they're officially dating.

235
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
She must trust him more than us.

236
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,360
But if Aunt Ploy actually likes him,

237
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,040
there's nothing we can do about it.

238
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,960
But know that it's better than letting it
happen without telling her anything.

239
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,560
Yes.

240
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,320
Miang. I'm stuffed.

241
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Why did you have to eat that much?

242
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,520
But you were the one
who wanted Ice cream, right?

243
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,760
Watch out, Miang!

244
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
I don't know what she plans to do next.

245
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm sure she'll go back to Puwin.

246
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,360
Get inside.

247
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
Why are you here?
Don't you care if anyone sees you?

248
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,960
Let them see me. Why would I care?
No need to hide anymore.

249
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Relax. What happened to you?

250
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Aunt Ploy canceled my wedding.

251
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,640
How am I supposed to react to that?

252
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,280
Everything is proceeding
as per our original plan.

253
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,960
In the end,

254
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
no one is truly sincere with you

255
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
except me.

256
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,360
We're made for each other.

257
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
What? I forgot my medicine?

258
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
We'll do it on the reunion night.

259
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,080
Do you think you can do your part in time?

260
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Are you scared?

261
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,680
What the hell are you playing at?

262
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,840
Why did you go through my stuff?

263
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,080
I was just looking for some painkillers.

264
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,680
And who'll carry it out?

265
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,080
Will you?

266
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,240
The last assignment
before the job is done.

267
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,000
We can't mess it up.

268
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh, Miss Dao?

269
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Are you here
to pick up the dress for Ms. Ploy?

270
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,120
It's not my job.

271
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,800
Here you are, Miss Dao.

272
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,440
We have a lot of beautiful
maternity dress designs for events.

273
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
I'll just browse for ideas then.

274
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,040
Please feel free.

275
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,720
I'm here to pick up Ms. Ploysaeng's dress.

276
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,880
Ah. Ms. Ploysaeng informed us.
Are you Miss Mirin?

277
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,080
- Yes.
- Over here please.

278
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,800
Aoy, can you get Ms. Ploy's dress for me?

279
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,440
‪-Good evening.
‪-Long time no see.

280
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,640
Ploy. Come and register here.

281
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Please.

282
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,040
- Aom. How are you doing?
- I'm doing well.

283
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,040
Ah, right here?

284
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
- Don't forget to update your phone number.
- Right.

285
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,200
Okay.

286
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,880
Are you doing well?

287
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,640
Hanging in there.

288
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
- Let's talk later, Aom.
- Alright.

289
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Fon?

290
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Fon. Are you here too?

291
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,720
How could you do this?!

292
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,720
What did I do?

293
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
You're fooling my friend!

294
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,480
You can charm any woman all you want,

295
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,520
but not Ploysaeng, my best friend!

296
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Wait, Fon.

297
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,400
You took it too far, Pu.
When will your ambition stop?!

298
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,600
You were just a poor country boy
who Lee took in.

299
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,120
Now you have a job and a high position.
Isn't that enough for you?

300
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,680
Why do you have to
trick my friend for more money?!

301
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,520
Fon…

302
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,240
Are you drunk?

303
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Whoa. All I can smell is alcohol.

304
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,160
Hey, if you can't quit drinking,

305
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,640
you shouldn't come to an event like this
and embarrass yourself.

306
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,160
Please forgive us. Sorry.

307
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,720
Let's cool down outside with me.

308
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,160
- Please forgive us. I'm so sorry.
- Pu.

309
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,200
- I'm not drunk.
- Sorry.

310
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,960
- Excuse us.
- Let go of me, Pu.

311
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,680
- I'm not drunk.
- Excuse me.

312
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
What's the commotion?

313
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,280
I can hear it from inside the room.

314
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,200
Are you the one who staged it?

315
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,160
Do you like Pu that much?

316
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
Why do I need to tell you?

317
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,120
No matter how good you are,
you can easily be ruined because of a man.

318
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,160
I can give him to you, at a cost.

319
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
Pu already told me.

320
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,040
Good. So I don't have to say it again.

321
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,200
Meet me at my house after the party,

322
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,040
alone.

323
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Pu, let go. It hurts.

324
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,520
Why did you do that?

325
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
You were humiliating me.

326
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,880
Pu, I'm sorry. I did it for you.

327
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,680
For me?

328
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,920
It's like you were burying me alive.

329
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,320
Did Ms. Lee tell you to do it?

330
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
Did she?

331
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,920
Tell me the truth

332
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,840
if you still want the money from me.

333
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Lee…

334
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,880
Lee threatened me,
saying that if I didn't do it,

335
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,240
she'd fire you.

336
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,040
Even if you didn't do it,

337
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,800
she would do anything
to get rid of me anyway!

338
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Ploy.

339
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,520
Long time no see.

340
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,240
Ploy, I… I'm sorry.

341
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,720
Forget it, Fon.

342
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,520
I knew

343
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,920
that Panalee

344
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,920
would do something
to humiliate me in front of people.

345
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,720
You knew, yet you brought Pu here.

346
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,400
Some things are worth the sacrifice.

347
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Do you really like my brother?

348
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,600
And would you mind
having me as your sister-in-law?

349
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,320
Ploy. You are my best friend.

350
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,200
How am I your best friend?

351
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,880
You left and cut off all contact with me.
When you were in trouble,

352
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,160
you didn't even ask me for help.

353
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,680
Don't feel bad for me,

354
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,720
and stop letting Lee abuse you.

355
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,760
When are you going back home?

356
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,600
Tomorrow.

357
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,280
Then, before you go back,

358
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,360
let's have a meal.

359
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,400
I want to get to know your brother better.

360
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,280
What's with you?

361
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,480
Why do you have to call repeatedly?
I'm talking to my friends.

362
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,520
This is not what we talked about.

363
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,840
I thought you liked surprises.

364
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,040
I paved the way for you
to buy Ms. Ploy's land easily.

365
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,760
Where did Fon come from?

366
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,719
Don't tell me she came by herself.

367
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,199
I told her to come.

368
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,320
I missed my friend.
Don't you miss your sister at all?

369
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,159
You were trying to humiliate me.

370
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,239
Yes. That's because
you were challenging me.

371
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,000
Do you think I'm not the vengeful kind?

372
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,960
<i>You chose the wrong woman to mess with.</i>

373
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,600
You'll be reminded
that we're built differently.

374
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
If I can groom you,
I can destroy you as well.

375
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,480
Be prepared for it.

376
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,960
Enjoy it while you can.

377
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Tonight, you'll smile for the last time.

378
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
You finally showed up.

379
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,920
Are you drunk?

380
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,400
I thought we were going to talk
while you were sober and fully conscious.

381
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,920
What I'm going to say to you

382
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,560
is short, and easy.

383
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,400
There's no need to be that sober.

384
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,120
Good.

385
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,920
Tell me about your offer.

386
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,480
Are you in a rush?

387
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,800
You want a man as soon as possible?

388
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,640
But the price Pu offered
is quite interesting.

389
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,320
When it's that much higher
than the evaluated price,

390
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,400
you'd be stupid
if you were not interested.

391
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,360
If I sell the land

392
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,720
connected to Tharnthong market to you,

393
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,560
how can I know for sure

394
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,680
that you would never
mess with the two of us again?

395
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,880
The two of you?

396
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,160
You were really born
to be my nemesis, weren't you?

397
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,040
You took Aran from me before.

398
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Now you're taking Pu from me!

399
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
In the end, I don't get to

400
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,720
have my men with me.

401
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,160
Everyone leaves me for you.

402
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,280
I didn't take Puwin from you.

403
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,720
Even if he has me,

404
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,120
he'll still be your brother.

405
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
If you let him live the life he wants,

406
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,720
he would come back to
take care of you like he did before.

407
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,480
Pu? Take care of me?

408
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,360
I have no one. Don't you understand?

409
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,640
I'm all alone.

410
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll die alone.

411
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,840
My sister and my friends
all have their families.

412
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm all on my own.

413
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,960
Nobody wants me in their life!

414
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,880
I saw you were drinking a lot
since you were at the party.

415
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,640
Let's talk later then.

416
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
You can't go anywhere.

417
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,360
Don't think you can trade a piece of land

418
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,600
just to keep Pu for yourself that easily.

419
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,840
I raised him.

420
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,440
I gave him his future.

421
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,600
I gave him his education.

422
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,600
All of that can't be bought with money!

423
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,400
Pu would never be able to repay me.

424
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
He belongs to me. Don't you get it?!

425
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
You're too drunk!

426
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,440
We can't understand each other like this.

427
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
Hey. I think…

428
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,560
we should talk about a deal next time.

429
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,880
I said you can't go anywhere!

430
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,440
It's all because of you,

431
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,280
that I have to be alone
for the rest of my life.

432
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,120
You took my fiancé from me!

433
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,280
You destroyed my life!

434
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,440
I'll kill you, Ploysaeng!

435
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,600
It ended a long time ago!

436
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,920
Why can't you move on from the past?!

437
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,320
Panalee.

438
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,680
How could you do this to me?!

439
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,600
Don't.

440
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,040
Stop! Don't!

441
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,240
Don't.

442
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,720
Stop the ceremony!

443
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,160
Ms. Lee.

444
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,920
Puwin is the boy I took in

445
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,440
and I won't allow him
to marry the person I didn't choose.

446
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,440
Mark my words. I own your life.

447
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,960
You have everything because of me.

448
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,840
You have to serve me
until the day I die, not another woman.

449
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,040
His family is poor and I felt bad.

450
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,120
He likes to tell
the girls he met that he's my brother.

451
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,920
He probably wants to
upgrade his social status.

452
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,160
Are you ashamed that I called you out
in front of everyone?

453
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,960
Why would you? If it wasn't for me,

454
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,600
would you be able to
be the manager by yourself?

455
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,800
You've completely destroyed
the reputation of my market!

456
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,040
You ungrateful bastard!

457
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,320
Miss Dao?

458
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,800
Are you on duty or something?
Why aren't you sleeping?

459
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,960
A sound woke me up,
so I'm just here to take a look.

460
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,240
Where are you going?

461
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Can you drive for me?

462
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,880
What did you say?

463
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,320
A threatened miscarriage is a possibility

464
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,640
Is there a chance of miscarriage?

465
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,360
From the pelvic exam and ultrasound,

466
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,560
it appears the bleeding has stopped.

467
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,160
Other than bleeding,

468
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,880
do you feel any lower abdominal pain?

469
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,120
Just a little bit.

470
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,480
Please don't worry too much,

471
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,080
as stress may have an effect on the baby.

472
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,360
Please wait for the doctor's
prescription for a moment.

473
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
Yes.

474
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,160
What did the doctor say?

475
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,120
The baby is safe.

476
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,360
I'm happy for you.

477
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,200
I thought you'd be disappointed.

478
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,880
You must want me to miscarry so bad.

479
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,720
Why would I want that?
The baby didn't do anything wrong.

480
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,480
I'm glad

481
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,160
that you care about your child
and didn't drive here yourself.

482
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,360
You even asked me for help.

483
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It doesn't matter who the father is.

484
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,640
What’s important is that
the baby is your flesh and blood.

485
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,080
If I were you, I'd do my best
to take care of the baby.

486
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
I wouldn’t let them grow up
without a complete family, like we did.

487
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,680
Don’t associate me with you.

488
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,440
What smells so bad?

489
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,600
Ms. Lee! Ms. Lee!

490
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,680
Ms. Lee!

491
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,520
KHAOSUAY

492
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,160
Mr. Pu! Where are you?

493
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,480
I'm at my condo. What do you want?

494
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,680
Ms. Lee has been shot dead.

495
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,760
How is that possible? What happened?

496
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,360
What should I do, Mr. Pu?

497
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,080
Call the police.

498
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,960
Could you please do that for me?

499
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,800
No. I'm not home.

500
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,280
And you're the one who
discovered the body. You need to do it.

501
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,720
Right.

502
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,080
Miang. Why is the police here?

503
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,680
To charge Ms. Ploy with
murdering Ms. Lee by gunshot.

504
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,400
How is that possible?

505
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,760
Ms. Ploy went to
Ms. Lee's house last night

506
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,240
and they got into an argument
that escalated into a fight.

507
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,360
Do they have the evidence
that Aunt Ploy shot Ms. Panalee dead?

508
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,440
They said that the CCTV footage
captured the murder.

509
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,200
When I was able to escape,

510
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,600
I immediately drove home
and didn't go back in.

511
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,800
But the CCTV footage

512
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,760
covered the area

513
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,720
and showed that
you went back in to shoot Ms. Panalee.

514
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,680
That's not true. That can't have been me.

515
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,920
If that's the case,
can I look at the footage?

516
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,120
Yes. Then, I'd like to have you

517
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,240
come to the station
for questioning as well.

518
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,800
No problem.

519
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,120
But I'll have to contact my lawyer first.

520
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,440
Please feel free.

521
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,120
If I were home,

522
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,560
this wouldn't have happened.

523
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,960
No need to blame yourself, Pu.

524
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,640
No one wants
something like this to happen.

525
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,600
Mom.

526
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,800
I think this house is cursed.

527
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,440
Two people have died in it.

528
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,840
We should sell it.

529
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,360
Are you crazy? Who would want to buy it?
We would be forced to sell it cheap.

530
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,960
How about this?

531
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,720
Let Pu stay here.
Think of it as a perk of your position.

532
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,680
Alright, Pu?

533
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,840
Pu. Are you scared?

534
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,760
I'm not.

535
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,880
I'll help take good care of this house.

536
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,320
Stay and help our business for
a long time, and I'll give you this house.

537
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,760
Thank you.

538
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,040
We're relatives anyway.

539
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,280
Letting you stay
is far better than selling it cheap.

540
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,120
What you said is right.

541
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,800
Pu.

542
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,560
Help our company, and don't leave us.

543
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,080
Right.

544
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,480
- Mom…
- Your sister is gone.

545
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040
Thanks.

546
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,480
Is the police done with the questioning?

547
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,280
Yes, sir.

548
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,320
Did you go on a trip again?

549
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,480
Can we really count on you to
look after the house? Should we fire you?

550
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,680
I've got a two-night
hotel voucher in Pattaya.

551
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,440
Do you want a vacation?

552
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,160
Me?

553
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,440
Are you allowing me to go on a trip?

554
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,400
But you should tell Ms. Lee in advance,

555
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,160
since the voucher might be date-specific.

556
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:12,960
What day is it?

557
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,800
I was the one who allowed
Khaosuay to go on vacation.

558
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,480
From this CCTV footage,

559
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,760
can you confirm
that it’s really you, Ms. Ployseang?

560
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,000
Yes.

561
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,360
Then let's look at the next clip.

562
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,280
<i>Stop! Don't!</i>

563
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,200
<i>This shocking murder</i>
<i>happened inside the home of Ms. Panalee,</i>

564
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,960
<i>a major entrepreneur who owns</i>
<i>Tharnthong Market. It's the second murder</i>

565
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,560
<i>that's happened inside this house,</i>
<i>not long after the first.</i>

566
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,320
The news doesn't seem to talk about
Ms. Ploy being a suspect.

567
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,280
But I don't think it'll take long.

568
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,520
A famous businesswoman
murdering a competitor

569
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,080
would make headlines for weeks.

570
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,160
What did I just say?

571
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,040
Whoa.

572
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,320
The angle of this CCTV footage
isn't clearly showing her.

573
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,360
It’s just that
the dress is the same color,

574
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,360
and the design is similar.

575
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,880
This type of dress
isn't really hard to find.

576
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,240
And it's a high-angle view.

577
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,080
Those who don't know me

578
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,080
would think it was the same person.

579
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,880
But I'm the accused.

580
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,840
I knew at first glance that it wasn’t me.

581
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,400
The physique is not even similar to me,
and the movements are off.

582
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,480
Anyone could dress like this,

583
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,640
and claim that they're Ms. Ploysaeng.

584
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,000
Are you suggesting that
this murder was staged

585
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,760
to frame Ms. Ploysaeng?

586
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,400
Yes.

587
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,080
And the dress you wore in the clip,

588
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,960
was it purchased or tailor-made?

589
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,560
It was tailor-made.

590
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,280
Then It's very unlikely
someone else has the same dress.

591
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,360
Well, we'll have to
look further at the evidence.

592
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,240
CCTV footage
doesn't really show the fabric,

593
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,120
materials, and design details.

594
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,960
Right. I'll have the experts
look further into this.

595
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,280
Before the incident, had you two

596
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,040
had any arguments?

597
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,240
We had.

598
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,880
You came up with all these plans

599
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,200
just to get your inheritance back?
That's it?

600
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,400
Dad gave it to me
but Aunt Ploy took it from me,

601
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,840
so I had to take it back!

602
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,600
<i>I think there's something fishy</i>
<i>about Mr. Aran's construction company.</i>

603
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,280
INCOME OF 2020

604
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,560
Have you found something?

605
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,120
<i>I had to adjust my plans quickly.</i>
<i>Did you wear gloves when you held the gun?</i>

606
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,880
Very thoughtful of you. That way,
we'll have the clear fingerprints

607
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,120
of the murderer.

608
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,080
<i>The general meeting of Tharnthong Group</i>

609
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,560
<i>reached a unanimous decision to appoint me</i>

610
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,400
<i>as the chief executive officer,</i>

611
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,360
<i>effective today.</i>

612
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,680
A scumbag like you
won't be happy for long.

613
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,040
Choose the right time to be born.

614
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,440
