1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,560
<i>Meet me in my room at 7 p.m.</i>

2
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,080
Dress beautifully.

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,760
<i>I like well-dressed girls.</i>

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,600
<i>Thank you for looking out for me,</i>

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,560
but I can take care of myself.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Tell me right now who's the father!

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,480
Mr. Pu already has a wife.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,320
What? You didn't know?

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Ms. Ploy knew about this.

10
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
How could you do this to me?

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Change of plan.

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
For Ms. Lee, you can do
whatever you want. Bye.

13
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,800
It won't be that easy.

14
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
Aunt Ploy?

15
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
You told me you couldn't make it.

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,400
Another event ended early,

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
and I'm here to see you as well.

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,640
I'd like to hear it from you again.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
Tell me the truth.

20
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Are you sure
you're the father of Dao's child?

21
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,480
I only did what you asked me to do.

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,720
But when the child is born
and we go through with a DNA test,

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
we'll know
if it's the one Miang and I suspect.

24
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
Have you waited long, Ms. Ploy?

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,880
I've just arrived.

26
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Then, should we go inside?

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Let's go.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
You can leave early if you want, Parit.

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Yes.

30
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,160
Please.

31
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Ms. Ploy told you to leave.
Was it hard to understand?

32
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
Ms. Mon!

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,400
Do you want to go to the hospital?

34
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
There's no need.

35
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
Do you know who did this?

36
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,040
We should file a report then. Let's go.

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
We shouldn't.

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,200
Why?

39
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,520
It's already obvious

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,400
that the two of them
did this to you to send a message

41
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,680
because your belongings
were left untouched.

42
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
I fear it was someone close to me.

43
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
It’s probably for the best
if I go and hide.

44
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,880
That means you have some idea who did it.

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,160
If it was not Ms. Lee,

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,520
then it has to be Miss Dao.

47
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,120
Aside from these two,
I don’t have any problems with anyone.

48
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
There's another one

49
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,200
whose plan you derailed
and caused trouble for.

50
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
It's Mr. Pu, your husband.

51
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,720
A divorce might not be enough.

52
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
He probably doesn't want you
to mess with his girl again.

53
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
If I die,

54
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,040
it could work out best for his plan.

55
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
If you're hurt this much,

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,000
we should do something
to put them in a difficult situation.

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
What’s your idea?

58
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>I know you sent someone to hurt me.</i>

59
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,520
<i>Next time,</i>
<i>I'll tell the police you did it.</i>

60
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,800
Are you stupid? Why would I do that?

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,120
<i>Please leave a message after the tone…</i>

62
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,240
You’ve got me wrong.

63
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
I don't know anything about it.

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
Call me back.

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
I KNOW YOU SENT SOMEONE TO HURT ME.

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
NEXT TIME,
I'LL TELL THE POLICE YOU DID IT.

67
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,960
Where are you moving to?

68
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,400
Probably one of my friends' houses.

69
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,960
Keep an eye on Mom for me.

70
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,280
Don't worry.

71
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,640
We can meet again
whenever she gets discharged.

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
Right.

73
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,640
Then, I'll put these in the car for you.

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
Wait.

75
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
I have something for you.

76
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,480
HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

77
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,400
You seem to like hydrangeas.

78
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,640
In case you want to plant them.

79
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you.

80
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
Keep it safe.

81
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
Someday,

82
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,040
it will come in handy for you.

83
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
Alright.

84
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
I'll keep it secure.

85
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,800
Who the hell are you?!

86
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,000
How was it?

87
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,120
Is it done?

88
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Both jobs are completed.

89
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,560
Thank you so much.

90
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,680
Go get your payment at the den.

91
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,080
Right. See you there.

92
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,120
This way, you'll have some idea

93
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,080
who hurt you.

94
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Parit!

95
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
What happened?!

96
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,360
Who did this to you?

97
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,040
A man broke in
to mess up my things and ambush me.

98
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,960
Get up on the couch.

99
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,360
Easy.

100
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,000
Does it hurt much?

101
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,520
A little bit.

102
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
But the pain is all gone when I see you.

103
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,320
This is not the time for that.

104
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,640
- That hurts!
- Sorry.

105
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
Did he take anything?

106
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
He didn't touch any valuable items.

107
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,800
He was here mainly to hurt me.

108
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
Ms. Mon was hurt in her house too.

109
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,680
When?

110
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,560
Earlier this evening.

111
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000
The timing was similar.

112
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,360
They might have even
been hired by the same person.

113
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,120
It was probably because Nichamon

114
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,920
revealed Dao's pregnancy,

115
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
and I said I was the father.

116
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,800
Then, the only two people
who would be troubled by this

117
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,840
are Miss Dao and Mr. Pu.

118
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,840
But Miss Dao would never hurt you.

119
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,640
She probably wouldn't send someone to
harm Nichamon either. It's not like her.

120
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,440
And they just fought,

121
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,240
so it would be too obvious.

122
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,760
You're right.

123
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
So, only one suspect remains.

124
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,320
From now on,
you will probably be able to relax

125
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,440
and don't have to
worry about Miss Dao anymore.

126
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
I hope so.

127
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,720
Did you have an auspicious date?

128
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,920
I do. Two dates, actually.

129
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,760
One is very soon,
and another is far too late.

130
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm deciding.

131
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
How soon is it?

132
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
It's the end of this month.

133
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,320
Wow, it's in under three weeks, isn't it?

134
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,880
What about another date?

135
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
It's in another five months.

136
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,960
It's not that late, I think.

137
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I'm afraid
the bump will be too noticeable.

138
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,920
And I'm afraid
something unexpected might happen.

139
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,720
Seems like you've got your answer.

140
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
I probably have to run it by them first.

141
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Keep it safe.

142
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,720
Someday,

143
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
it will come in handy for you.

144
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,920
Why did she insist on that so much?
There's nothing special about it.

145
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,440
Did she hide any notes in here?

146
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,480
Three asterisks?

147
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
Those asterisks are only on one page.

148
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,040
The general characteristics of hydrangeas…

149
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,920
Do I need to decode something?

150
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
Or do I need to look through the light?

151
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I probably watch too many TV series.

152
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,920
HYDRANGEA PLANTING GUIDE

153
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,839
Wait.

154
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,319
What are you going to do to me, Mr. Pu?

155
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,800
What's wrong with you?

156
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,040
Nothing, sir.

157
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,200
You've been
looking scared around me lately.

158
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,960
What happened?

159
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,280
Nothing.

160
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,520
You're lying.

161
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,760
I'm scared now.
Please don't do anything to me.

162
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
What did you do?

163
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Tell me.

164
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,520
So…

165
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,680
I…

166
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,080
I…

167
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
What?

168
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
I burned your shirt
while I was ironing it.

169
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,920
I thought it was something else.

170
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,760
It was actually two of your shirts.

171
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,760
I knew it.
That's why I can't find my shirts.

172
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
I'll be more careful.

173
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
Wait.

174
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I'll serve it to Ms. Lee myself.
I have something to talk to her about.

175
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,280
Uh, Ms. Lee told me that

176
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,320
she doesn't want anyone to
disturb her this morning, including you.

177
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,480
I'll serve it myself.
She's been waiting for a while now.

178
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,400
Where is it coming from?

179
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,280
It might be from our gate.

180
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,280
Who is that? So rude.

181
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
Miang, could you go check?

182
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Yes.

183
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,040
They might have come to the wrong house.

184
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,160
It's Ms. Kanta. What should we do?

185
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,600
Open the gate for her

186
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,080
before she crashes into our house.

187
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,880
What are you doing here?

188
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
I'm here to protect your rights.

189
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
Didn't you understand what I've told you?

190
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,200
I understand, but I don't agree with you.

191
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,040
What’s your business here?

192
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
If things escalate,

193
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,440
I will feel bad for the rest of my life.

194
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,960
Then I'll be by Ms. Ploy's side.

195
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,560
Good. Ms. Kanta is not very reasonable.

196
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,560
She can be impulsive and can't be trusted.

197
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
- Go ahead.
- Right.

198
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,600
You are going to
have my daughter marry someone

199
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,200
without talking
to her biological mother first.

200
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
How could you do that?!

201
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,840
It is what your daughter wants.

202
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,800
Even if it's not,

203
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,720
I have the right to decide

204
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,200
without getting your permission.

205
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,960
Do you intend to mistreat my daughter

206
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,240
by letting her marry someone unworthy?

207
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,480
Who's unworthy here?

208
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Do you think you know Parit well enough?

209
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,840
Why wouldn’t I know him?

210
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
He's just a boy in your neighborhood
who is the son of a teacher!

211
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
His father died.

212
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,600
The mother got a new foreign husband

213
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,200
and had to follow her husband to the USA.

214
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,480
Don't you even think for a second

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,760
that they moved there
because they love each other?

216
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,840
Someone like you wouldn't understand.

217
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Understand or not, it's my business.

218
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,600
But what I need you to understand

219
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,600
is that I won't allow Dao

220
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,280
to marry a pathetic salaryman like him!

221
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,280
If you want your daughter
to be pregnant without the father,

222
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,200
then suit yourself.

223
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Parit.

224
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,640
I've been listening for a while.

225
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,920
I don't want trouble with a soon-to-be
in-law. If you don't want me, I'm out.

226
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,880
She's not a part of this, Parit.
Don't listen to her.

227
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I'm the one getting married, not you.

228
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,480
And this is the last time
I will ever get married!

229
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,880
I will only marry someone I love.

230
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,880
I don't care about anything else.

231
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,840
I only want the best for you!

232
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Just you wait.

233
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
I'm never going to let you marry this man!

234
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
I'll do everything to stop it!

235
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,120
The wedding between you and him
is not going to happen!

236
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
Wait a minute.

237
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,320
Was Parit attacked in his own house

238
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,280
because you had someone do it?

239
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,480
Are you crazy?

240
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,400
What happened, Parit?!

241
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,080
Is that true, Parit?

242
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,080
Someone broke in
to mess up my things and attack me.

243
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,160
He probably just wanted to threaten me
since my belongings were still there.

244
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
Why are you all looking at me?!
I didn't have anything to do with it!

245
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,840
It could be one of the men

246
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,880
you've been flirting with everywhere.
They might not like him. Who knows?

247
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,600
Let's just say that
I don't agree with this marriage.

248
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,240
If I don't get to marry Parit
because of you,

249
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,640
I'll stop sending money to you right away.

250
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,760
You know I mean it.

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,160
Parit. Dao.

252
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,240
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

253
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,000
You should have told me. This is serious.

254
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,320
You could have been killed in your house.

255
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,480
I was worried you might feel uneasy.

256
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
If something worse happened to you,

257
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,080
how could I face Maratee?

258
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm the one who is arranging your wedding.

259
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,000
Could it be because of something

260
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,920
other than our marriage?

261
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,160
Don't try to protect your mother.

262
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,640
She's all talk, Aunt Ploy.

263
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,560
She wouldn't hire a thug to harm anyone.

264
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,360
How about work?

265
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Are you in conflict with anyone lately?

266
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,800
Then there's Mr. Puwin.

267
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,200
We've competed for…

268
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,800
the investors
during the seminar in Khao Yai.

269
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,560
But it shouldn't be something
worth harming each other over.

270
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,680
From my experience with him,

271
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,000
he's not that kind of person.

272
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,640
What about you?

273
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,400
Have you been
breaking anyone's heart recently?

274
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,560
I've learned my lesson, Aunt Ploy.

275
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,040
But if there's someone who likes me
and is upset with Parit,

276
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't know.

277
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm sorry

278
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,680
for inviting you to
this unscheduled urgent meeting.

279
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,240
Will the president attend this meeting?

280
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,960
I didn't invite Mom

281
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,080
because I'd like to listen to
the board's opinions first.

282
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,600
Are we all here?

283
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
Yes, Ms. Lee.

284
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,600
Then I'd like to start now.

285
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I am displeased

286
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,280
with much of Puwin's misconduct,

287
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,320
which I believe
will affect our company's image.

288
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,160
Many of you might be aware of it.

289
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
I'd like to provide a brief context.

290
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,560
One.

291
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
Puwin…

292
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,840
is secretly married and has a wife.

293
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,240
I've just found out about it too.

294
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,200
In fact, being married or not
is a personal affair.

295
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
Choosing to keep it a secret is not wrong.

296
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,960
But using the position

297
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,560
of acting chief executive officer

298
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,920
to gain personal benefits
is not right in my opinion.

299
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
I believe you've all heard the rumor
about Puwin and Ploysaeng.

300
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,440
I can confirm that it's true.

301
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
Ploysaeng took an interest in Puwin

302
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,600
because of his CEO position,

303
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,520
without knowing about his marriage.

304
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,200
I don't know

305
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,080
if he'll use the position

306
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
to trick any other high-society women.

307
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,320
Would the board

308
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,320
still choose someone like this

309
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,520
to represent us?

310
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Mr. Pu!

311
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,080
There's a big problem.

312
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400
What is it?

313
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Please don't tell anyone I said this.

314
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
I won't. Tell me what happened?

315
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,280
Ms. Lee called for an urgent board meeting

316
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,120
to remove you
from the acting CEO position.

317
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,440
That's not all.

318
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,400
Aside from chasing multiple women,

319
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,200
he also has a tendency to be violent.

320
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,480
This must stem from
the hardships of his childhood.

321
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,120
Was it the incident where he fought
a manager from Camellia

322
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,040
over a woman?

323
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,040
Do you know about it as well?

324
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,800
They're trying to cover it up.

325
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,040
The woman is the stepdaughter
of Ms. Ploysaeng.

326
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,160
I heard the same.

327
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,920
Should such a deceitful person

328
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
who has been involved in many scandals

329
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,080
be trusted to lead Tharnthong Group?

330
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,120
I'd like to propose you to remove Puwin

331
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,280
from the acting
chief executive officer position.

332
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Is it too late for me to explain myself?

333
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,240
Please. The board shouldn't listen
to only one side of the story.

334
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,600
Thank you.

335
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,440
Apologies, Ms. Lee.

336
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,840
Go ahead.

337
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,000
We're here to listen.

338
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,840
There are many rumors about me

339
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,400
which are, more or less,
affecting our company image.

340
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,520
I'd say more.

341
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,560
Right.

342
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
So, I'd like a chance to explain.

343
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,480
First…

344
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,720
I've really been married.

345
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,560
But we've been separated
for a long time now.

346
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,400
We never registered
a marriage certificate,

347
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,040
and only had a small wedding ceremony
at her house.

348
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,400
So, no one knew about it.

349
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,000
So,

350
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,160
it’s not inappropriate for me

351
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,240
to date any woman.

352
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,080
And the fight over a woman
was nothing but a misunderstanding.

353
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,800
I intended to protect Miss Dao's honor.

354
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,200
If I hadn't been there that night,

355
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,640
Miss Dao wouldn't be able to
marry him this month.

356
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,000
I don't think I should
go through more details.

357
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,960
It's quite a sensitive topic.

358
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,560
What about the relationship
between you and Ms. Ploysaeng?

359
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,720
We're really seeing each other.

360
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,600
But I don't see
any negative impact from this.

361
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,400
On the other hand,
I think it's a good thing

362
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,560
if Tharnthong Group
and Camellia become allies.

363
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,440
We can smoothly grow our business.

364
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,600
A personal grudge
from the older generation

365
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,760
may hinder our company's growth.

366
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
It should be put to an end.

367
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,000
Did you dare to challenge me, Pu?

368
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,720
You're the one who started it.

369
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,320
Wasn't it you

370
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
who teamed up with Nichamon
to deceive me?!

371
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,080
You didn't give me any chance to explain.

372
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,840
I don't want to listen
to any of your lies.

373
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,200
Then I won't waste my breath.

374
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
How dare you?

375
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,840
You're all high and mighty now.

376
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
Spoke with confidence in the meeting.

377
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,960
Took the credit for the good,

378
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,760
and passed the blame for the bad.

379
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,040
I've learned it all from you.

380
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,440
Pu!

381
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,560
Keep grinning.

382
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,720
You won't have your power for long.

383
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,840
I will do anything
to remove you from the position!

384
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,720
Get out of my face!

385
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,840
Go!

386
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,920
Do you think
you have Ploysaeng as your backup,

387
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
so you can do anything to me?

388
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
We'll find out soon enough

389
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,760
who, between you and me,

390
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,200
will be gone first.

391
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,640
Did you leave work early today?

392
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,560
Nai invited me to a dinner, but I passed.

393
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,800
Jogging with me
might make your bride jealous.

394
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,120
Miang.

395
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,480
Let's talk it out first.

396
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,880
Were you just kidding,
or are you actually upset?

397
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,760
I know what we're doing.

398
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
You need to be more careful, Parit.

399
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,800
They were just threatening you,

400
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,040
but they might do more
as we get closer to the wedding day.

401
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,560
That would be nice.

402
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,440
So it'll be easier to expose him.

403
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,080
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

404
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,560
Be honest with me.

405
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Are you more afraid of
me dying or marrying Dao?

406
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,080
This is not the time for a joke like that.

407
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,159
I'm sorry, Miang.

408
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
Rest assured.

409
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,600
I promise I won’t die because of this.

410
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,719
And I would never marry Dao.

411
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
My heart

412
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,400
is here.

413
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,600
Good timing.

414
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,040
I want to give Parit a birthday surprise.

415
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,560
Give me the key to his house.

416
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,760
Don't tell me you don't have it,
cause I won't believe you.

417
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I have it.

418
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,720
What are you going to do in there?

419
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,480
I'll go in
and set up a surprise for Parit.

420
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I've ordered a bunch of balloons.

421
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,080
Do you want it now?

422
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,920
Yeah, give it to me. And I'll keep it

423
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,880
since I'll marry him
at the end of this month

424
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,360
and move into his house.

425
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,400
You won't need a spare key anymore.

426
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,560
Right. I'll go get it for you.

427
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,560
You took it better than I thought.

428
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,160
Dao!

429
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,280
Aren't you going to bed yet?

430
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,920
You're pregnant.
You shouldn't stay up late.

431
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Once I'm done with the card for Parit,
I'll go straight to bed.

432
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,160
Did you remember his birthday?

433
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,040
I did. His birthday is close to mine.

434
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,440
And I've already prepared
a birthday surprise for him.

435
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,120
Whoa. You were ahead of me.

436
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,960
I just started writing a card for him.

437
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,760
What are you doing?

438
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,560
HBD, PARIT

439
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm sticking the heart piece onto it.

440
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,400
It looks so adorable.

441
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,080
Can I read it?

442
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,080
I just wrote a bunch of generic wishes.

443
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
I'm happy for you, Dao. From now on,

444
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,680
I wish you nothing but the true happiness.

445
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Thank you.

446
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,840
Happy birthday, Parit.

447
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,320
Wishing you lots of happiness.

448
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,560
- Wow.
- Yeah!

449
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,320
You're luckier than me
since your cake hasn't been shoved away.

450
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,800
But both of you

451
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
acted like
you'd really forgotten my birthday.

452
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,720
Why? Were you upset?

453
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,640
A little bit.

454
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,080
Who would forget about
someone important like you?

455
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,520
Then, let's unwrap the presents
before eating the cake.

456
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,840
I'll go first then.

457
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,560
I was going to give you this

458
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,800
the day you were going to study abroad.

459
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,480
But I couldn't make it in time.

460
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,120
So, I'd like to
give it to you on your birthday.

461
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,480
Thank you, Chawee.

462
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,640
May the sacred beings

463
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,440
protect my Parit,

464
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,560
and I wish you a healthy life

465
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,320
free from any harm.

466
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,480
Amen.

467
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,120
Who's next? I'd like to be the last one.

468
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
I'll go.

469
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,160
For you, Parit.

470
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,840
Whoa. What is this?

471
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,400
Wow.

472
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,040
There.

473
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,040
Wow. The design looks great.

474
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,400
You're good at picking this.

475
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,440
Should we put them on together, Parit?

476
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,360
I think we should save them
for the wedding day.

477
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,000
Good idea. We have the rings now
and don't need to buy them again.

478
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,320
- Alright. Let me keep them.
- Okay.

479
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,960
Where's my present?

480
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,280
I couldn't get it in time.
I'll give it to you later.

481
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,000
You can just say you forgot.

482
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Then I'll reveal my surprise present now.

483
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
But you'll have to close your eyes, Parit.

484
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,440
- Close your eyes. Don't try to defy me.
- Right. Right.

485
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,160
- Don't open them just yet.
- I won't, Aunt Ploy.

486
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,320
What could it be?

487
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
- Hello.
- What?

488
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,120
What?

489
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,240
Wait. Can I open my eyes, Aunt Ploy?

490
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,480
You can do it after my countdown.

491
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,920
Three, two, one. Open them!

492
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,840
Mom!

493
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,160
Yeah.

494
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,480
You told me you weren't coming.

495
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,960
Ms. Ploy didn't want me to tell you,

496
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,720
so I had to come to surprise you today.

497
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,360
I've missed you so much, teacher.

498
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,720
Aw. I've missed you too, Dao.

499
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,280
Another one is about to cry right here.

500
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,880
There’s my crybaby. Come here, Miang.

501
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,280
This birthday party is filled with tears.

502
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,840
Ms. Ploy's surprise is for all of us.

503
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,000
Right? Miang.

504
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,360
Do you want to have
his birthday surprise all by yourself?

505
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,880
She hasn't wished her son
a happy birthday.

506
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
I'm sorry.

507
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,880
Hi. Happy birthday, Son.

508
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,280
Thank you.

509
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,040
Happy birthday, Mr. Parit.

510
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,040
Who invited you?

511
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,920
Why can't I come?

512
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,600
You're here to mess with me, aren't you?

513
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,920
Can't I come to my girlfriend's house?

514
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,080
I'm talking about Ms. Ploy.

515
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,520
I hope Aunt Ploy accepts you soon as well,

516
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,440
so you will stop
sticking your nose in my business.

517
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,080
You can't run away from me.

518
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm the father of your child, after all.

519
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,160
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before the secret is out</i>

520
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,720
I'll give you a chance
to enjoy this short-lived happiness.

521
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,560
And please get back on track

522
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,080
before everything falls apart.

523
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,560
Hey. What's with you?

524
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,720
You didn't tell me
you were going to get married at all.

525
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,920
I thought you might be too busy to come.

526
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,480
I had to come, no matter how busy I am.

527
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,680
It's my son's wedding.

528
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,040
Parit must have been busy
with the work at Camellia,

529
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,000
so I had to be the one to tell you myself.

530
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,880
No need to speak for him, Ms. Ploy.

531
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,000
I know this guy well enough.

532
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,680
He was afraid I would stop him.

533
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
Would you stop me?

534
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,280
How could I? You already got Dao pregnant.

535
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,240
Your life is yours.

536
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,040
I've always trusted your decisions.

537
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm here just to congratulate you
and that's it.

538
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

539
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,440
Let's all go eat.

540
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,440
The table must be ready.

541
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Let's go.

542
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,800
I was determined to prepare

543
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,760
Thai food for you, Maratee.

544
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,720
Thank you so much.

545
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,280
These are all my favorites.

546
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,880
Did you cook Thai food
when you were there?

547
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,600
Oh, not so much.

548
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,640
I couldn't find all the spices.
It wouldn't be good anyway.

549
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,320
Chawee's mango chili paste is here.

550
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,800
So fast.

551
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,560
- Wow.
- It was freshly cooked.

552
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,760
This is my favorite.

553
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,440
Chawee hasn't forgotten, has she?

554
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,960
Just the smell is enough
to make my mouth water.

555
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,800
Have plenty of it, teacher.

556
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,880
Yes.

557
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,560
- Miang.
- Yes?

558
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,200
Come eat with us.

559
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,880
You can sit here next to my mom.

560
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,720
She can sit here.

561
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,200
I want to sit next to teacher.

562
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,800
I had some in the kitchen.

563
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,200
Tell me if you want anything.

564
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,120
Have some more.

565
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,800
- Thank you.
- Do you want anything else?

566
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,240
Maybe some veggies.

567
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,800
Did you see the birthday present

568
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,960
that Dao bought for Parit?

569
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,240
They're matching rings. So lovely.

570
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,280
The present?

571
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,880
Are you planning
to use them on two occasions?

572
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,120
Both his birthday and wedding day.
What a smart girl.

573
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,800
I didn't think about it that much.

574
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,560
I just wanted to have
matching rings with Parit.

575
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,440
Where did you keep the rings, Dao?
Please show them to my mom.

576
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,520
Sure.

577
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,560
Here.

578
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,400
Wow. They're really lovely.
You have a good eye.

579
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,640
And where's the card?
Did you give it to him?

580
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,120
I saw you writing it for a long time.

581
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,040
I'll read it then.

582
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,600
Parit! Don't! It's embarrassing.

583
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,880
- Come on. No need to be embarrassed.
- Parit.

584
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,480
She's embarrassed.

585
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,320
HBD, PARIT

586
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,680
So adorable.

587
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,680
Can I read it out loud?

588
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,800
Please don't, Parit.

589
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,040
Here. This is the important part.

590
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,120
"I promise I'll be a good wife for you,

591
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,600
take care of you,

592
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,160
and make you happy every day."

593
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,280
"You're the one I love the most."

594
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,960
Wow. Look at this.

595
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,480
A heart jigsaw piece.

596
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,560
Didn't you tell me
the heart piece was lost?

597
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,960
Why did it end up
in Parit's birthday card?

598
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,360
Don't tell me it's not the same one

599
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,560
or it's from a different puzzle.
I don't believe you!

600
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,720
It took forever
for me to finish that puzzle.

601
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,160
But when I was
about to put the heart in there,

602
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,840
it didn't feel right.

603
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,200
We didn't love each other.
We've only been working together.

604
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,600
And why would I have to give you my heart?

605
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,120
But you're mine.

606
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,040
Don't you already have Nichamon?

607
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,920
And you also had that poor country girl
that you divorced.

608
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,040
Could you stop talking about others?

609
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,760
Why?

610
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,440
They're untouchable because
your love for them was too deep?

611
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,920
You didn't give me your heart as well.

612
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,800
But we're having a child together.

613
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,040
Stop using a child as an excuse.

614
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,680
Abortion is an option.

615
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,680
I don't want to keep it that much myself.

616
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,280
Where are you, ma'am?

617
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,040
What’s so important
that you want to talk now

618
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,800
and couldn’t wait until tomorrow?

619
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,080
It's about your daughter.

620
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,080
What did Dao do?

621
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
The father of her child

622
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,880
is me.

623
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,240
What? It isn't Parit's child?

624
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,360
It's certainly mine.

625
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,200
But Dao is planning
to ditch me and marry him.

626
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,280
Parit told me himself

627
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,600
that he won't do a DNA test

628
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,400
because he wants to get rich.

629
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,120
I knew it!

630
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,920
That bastard just wants Dao's money!

631
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,480
Are you the one who sent
a man to hurt Nichamon and Parit?

632
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,880
We're on the same side.

633
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,040
You can tell me the truth.

634
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,800
Well, I wouldn't say hurt them.

635
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,560
Just teach them some lessons.

636
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,040
Parit's mother is back in Thailand

637
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,880
to attend her son's wedding.

638
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,480
I won't lose
my girlfriend and my child to him.

639
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,880
I don't want him as my son-in-law either!

640
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,760
Then,

641
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,280
just a threat

642
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,440
won't be enough anymore.

643
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,280
If the groom is gone,

644
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,920
there will be no wedding.

645
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,720
Where's my present?

646
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,280
If you forgot, I would be really upset.

647
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
I didn't forget.

648
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,680
I just didn't want to
outshine your bride-to-be.

649
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,640
Again with sarcasm.

650
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,360
The present.

651
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,120
Here you go.

652
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,880
Fine. Hit another one too.

653
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,560
Here.

654
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,280
If Miss Dao sees us,
there will be endless drama.

655
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,400
The present is in the wardrobe
in your bedroom.

656
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,680
Find it yourself.

657
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,360
Happy birthday.

658
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,760
Oh!

659
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,880
My gosh.

660
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,640
If this is what you want,

661
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,160
just don’t cry over it later.

662
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,280
If I can groom you,
I can destroy you as well.

663
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,280
Wait for it, Pu.

664
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,560
Enjoy it while you can.

665
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,000
Tonight, you'll smile for the last time.

666
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,680
I'll kill you. Ploysaeng!

667
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,400
How could you do this to me?

668
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,560
Huh?

669
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,280
Stop! Don't!

670
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,680
