=Episode 11=

30
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,720
Now that everything's come to light,

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,720
all you care about is Zheng Shu.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,800
What about His Lordship's dignity?

33
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,240
Everyone says you love your son,

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,570
but do you really?

35
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,280
You want Zheng Shu to be his concubine.

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,050
You tampered with the box

37
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,640
for her sake.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,930
You even drugged His Lordship,

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,330
all for Zheng Shu.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,840
His Lordship is the ruler of Wei.

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,680
His marriage should serve the greater good.

42
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,640
The marriage alliance is taking effect,

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,080
but you keep interfering.

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,070
I'm afraid you don't want His Lordship

45
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,550
to truly take the throne!

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,610
How dare you!

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,120
You don't want Zheng Shu to leave.

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,680
Do you know the Lord is leaving

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,730
out of shame?

50
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
In this matter,

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,010
he did nothing wrong.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,490
He's the Lord of Wei,

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,640
yet he had to oversee the canal repairs.

54
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,120
Did you ever consider how far

55
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,330
he'd have to travel
and how much he'd suffer?

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,400
Even the shoes you casually gifted him

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,730
were a size too small.

58
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,400
I noticed Zheng Shu
was perfectly dressed

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,080
with your care,

60
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,400
so I realized you can be thoughtful,

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,730
but you just won't be thoughtful
to the Lord.

62
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,890
Since that's the case,

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,120
from this day forward,

64
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,840
I alone will take care

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,450
of his daily needs.

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,290
Enough.

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,050
How could you understand
my care about Zhonglin?

68
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,520
You... Get out!

69
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,450
Mother, please rest well.

70
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,330
My Lady.

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,940
(Yujun, Wei State)

72
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,700
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

73
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,650
Go find something fragrant for me.

74
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,290
We just returned
from the execution ground,

75
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,540
covered in the stench of blood.

76
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,510
Someone doesn't like that smell.

77
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,090
It's better to avoid trouble.

78
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,570
Yes.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,730
No need to rush, My Lady.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
There's no telling
when the Lord will return.

81
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,050
It's fine.

82
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,360
Just a few more stitches.

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
I want to finish it
before he departs tomorrow.

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,490
In that case,

85
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,120
let me help you finish it.

86
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,440
No need to fuss over such a short time.

87
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,120
Since I've promised Mother
to treat him with sincerity,

88
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
I mustn't be negligent.

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,370
How about this?

90
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,800
Go prepare a meal first.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,360
If the Lord doesn't return tonight,

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,170
choose a few of his favorites

93
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,200
and deliver them to him.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,650
Tell him to take care of himself.

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, My Lady.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,440
What is this?

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,410
It's rose petals.

98
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,930
If you find it unsuitable,

99
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,800
I'll go replace it.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,290
No need.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,650
Roses may have thorns,

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
but they're fragrant and sweet.

103
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,610
My Lord, you're back.

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,850
I've had food prepared.

105
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,760
Would you like to eat with me?

106
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,290
Do as you see fit.

107
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,170
That day, I was just startled,

108
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,760
not afraid of you.

109
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,290
Why bring that up?

110
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,320
I didn't take it to heart.

111
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,730
I know what kind of man you are.

112
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,490
Even in the most perilous moments,

113
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,800
you never forced me.

114
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,420
However,

115
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,490
that day wasn't your fault.

116
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,050
Why blame yourself?

117
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
I never blamed myself.

118
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,320
Reconstructing the canal

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,970
is indeed important.

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,300
But you had made

121
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,120
the arrangements clear

122
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,880
back when we were in Panyi.

123
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,320
This time,

124
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,730
it's just a formality.

125
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,000
You're a noble.

126
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,140
Normally...

127
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,530
I know you're eloquent.

128
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
Now, let's eat.

129
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,120
What's this?

130
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,120
I noticed your belt was getting old,

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,680
so...

132
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,240
You made this yourself?

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,730
I was in a rush.

134
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,120
It's not very good.

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,930
That's true.

136
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,850
This pair of mandarin ducks

137
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,120
looks like two ducks.

138
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,970
It's not that bad.

139
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,730
Besides, they aren't mandarin ducks.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,490
They're phoenixes.

141
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,680
You can't even tell phoenixes,

142
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,750
yet you dare criticize me?

143
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,200
That's why your needlework is poor.

144
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,120
Who would guess these are phoenixes?

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,290
When you're bored at home,

146
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,850
you should improve your needlework.

147
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
Yes, My Lord.

148
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,610
If you don't mind,

149
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,000
would you try the size?

150
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,050
It's just a belt.

151
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,120
No need to try it.

152
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,250
I'll try it later.

153
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,690
Let's eat.

154
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,380
(Wei Mansion)

155
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,060
(Wei Mansion)

156
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,840
Whenever you have something
on your mind,

157
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
you always ask me to keep you company.

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,800
But today,

159
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,840
I truly can't drink this tea.

160
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,250
You may skip the tea,

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,370
but I still need to trouble you

162
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,770
for some advice.

163
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,800
Are you trying to ask about the Lady?

164
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
How did you know?

165
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,440
She also came to see me a few days ago.

166
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,200
What did you tell her?

167
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,800
Since you and she are husband and wife,

168
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,290
you are the closest of kin.

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,680
In that case,

170
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,010
why scheme against each other?

171
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,130
Then from now on,

172
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,530
I will never hurt her again.

173
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,480
But the Qiao Clan's crimes

174
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,170
are unforgivable.

175
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
Yes, put it here.

176
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,230
Hurry up there.

177
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,490
Put it here.

178
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,090
Hurry up.

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,310
That cart.

180
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,410
Get everything done asap.

181
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,320
(Government Office)

182
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,650
Hurry up. Move faster.

183
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,170
What's going on?

184
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,560
My Lord, commoners have come
to see you off.

185
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,490
See me off?

186
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,170
You personally go

187
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,480
to inspect canal work.

188
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,320
We should handle it properly

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
so the people can see

190
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,480
that you love the people.

191
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,930
When are you leaving?

192
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,870
We'll see you off.

193
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,410
Do you

194
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,770
want me to leave?

195
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,730
No.

196
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,960
You're going far,

197
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,130
so we're going to see you off.

198
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,600
The wine is here! The wine is here!

199
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,350
The wine is here! The wine is here!

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,290
The wine is here, My Lord.

201
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,370
The wine is here.

202
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,930
If you're so happy,

203
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,770
you should

204
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,930
go by yourself.

205
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,480
My Lord, I didn't say I was happy.

206
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,770
It's the perfect opportunity

207
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,230
for you to get some real experience.

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,930
I'm still young, My Lord.

209
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,320
I've never handled a task on my own.

210
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm not good enough for this.

211
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,680
Go through it once,

212
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,050
and you'll grow.

213
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
It's settled, then.

214
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,770
Yes.

215
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,200
Do you all want to go too?

216
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,370
- No.
- We're mature enough.

217
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,210
That's right.

218
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,080
My Lord, the Lady sent this belt
and some dessert

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
for you to eat on the road.

220
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
I'll take the belt.

221
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,080
Take this.

222
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,130
Eat it on the way.

223
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,930
My Lord, the Lady prepared it for you.

224
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,370
Why don't you come with me?

225
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,560
You take it.
I'll go home for a warm meal.

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Bye.

227
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,370
Go as instructed.

228
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,580
It means the Lord values you
and wants to train you.

229
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,970
Go on.

230
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,080
Wait for me to return.

231
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,130
Do your best.

232
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm starving.

233
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,730
Let's eat together.

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
Chunniang, set another place
at the table.

235
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,320
Yes.

236
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,080
Was the food I sent not to your liking?

237
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,890
No.

238
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,370
I've sent Wei Duo
to supervise the canal repairs.

239
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
He took the dessert

240
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,770
for the road.

241
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,560
It seems your cold

242
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,930
is already cured.

243
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,130
Just stay home and rest.

244
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,250
Don't rush around

245
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,200
to exhaust yourself.

246
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,840
You're the most thoughtful

247
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,650
and smooth-tongued

248
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,720
in the entire household.

249
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,410
You flatter me, My Lord.

250
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,210
By the way,

251
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,720
Grandmother's birthday

252
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
is coming soon.

253
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,930
Mother handled it every year,

254
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,320
but she can't do it this time.

255
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,960
You should handle it.

256
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,220
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

257
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,940
(Su Ehuang, Lady of Bianzhou)

258
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,340
(Chen Xiang, Governor of Bianzhou)

259
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,320
How could you stand by and watch

260
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,560
the Qiao Clan flag rise over Boya?

261
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,560
You even lost Xiaogang too.

262
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,560
You were once a famed general,

263
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,930
yet you lost to a stable hand.

264
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,840
How humiliating!

265
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,160
My Lord,

266
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,080
I failed in my duty.

267
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Please punish me.

268
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,570
Darling, don't get upset.
It's not good for your health.

269
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
Right now, we need capable people.

270
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,770
Why not

271
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,170
set this matter aside for now

272
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,560
and give him a chance to redeem himself?

273
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Thank you, My Lord.

274
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,010
Thank you, My Lady.

275
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Here.

276
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,700
Now that Wei and Yanzhou

277
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,560
have formed an alliance,

278
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
this won't be easy.

279
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,130
Since Li Su died in battle,

280
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,290
Bianzhou has lacked good generals.

281
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,010
Our forces

282
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,650
can't match Wei's strength.

283
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,600
We shouldn't engage them head-on
for now.

284
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,080
You're wise, My Lady.

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,410
I've carried an empress's fate
since birth.

286
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
A seer once said

287
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,170
I'd marry the ruler
of the Central Plains.

288
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,650
Naturally, I must be able to assist him.

289
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,800
You are remarkable.

290
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,930
It's me who's not good enough

291
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,250
to be your husband.

292
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,650
How could you be so pessimistic?

293
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,940
Though I've married you,

294
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,650
I haven't had any children.

295
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,050
I was thinking:

296
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,130
If we could adopt a child

297
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,010
who's both talented and handsome

298
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,010
and have you raise him,

299
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,680
it might ease your burdens sooner.

300
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,800
That doesn't matter.

301
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,560
I have Uncle's support now.

302
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,370
Xiang.

303
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,370
Uncle.

304
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,130
Greetings, My Lord.

305
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,440
Darling.

306
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,600
Are you

307
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,050
feeling better now?

308
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,740
I've sent people to other places

309
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,900
in search of physicians skilled
in treating coughs.

310
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,600
(Chen Pang, Prefect of Danjun)
They should

311
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,080
arrive soon.

312
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
Uncle,

313
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,330
with my wife caring for me,

314
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,480
you don't need to worry too much.

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,930
Ever since Lady Su

316
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,480
married you,

317
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,170
Bianzhou has suffered
defeat after defeat,

318
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,720
and our influence is fading by the day.

319
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,410
Now, even you have fallen ill.

320
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,000
I must ask:

321
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,440
Lady Su, is your forehead mark

322
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,260
meant to bring fortune to Bianzhou

323
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,610
or disaster?

324
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,040
You make a fair point.

325
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,580
(Su Zixin, Su Ehuang's cousin)
Ehuang.

326
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,330
Has the Lord

327
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,970
agreed to the adoption?

328
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,040
It's still under discussion.

329
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,330
But the envoy from Wushan

330
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,890
mentioned this specifically.

331
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,370
So what?

332
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,850
Did he refuse?

333
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,130
He's seriously ill.

334
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,040
What if...

335
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,100
Nothing will happen to him.

336
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,470
What we should worry about now
is Chen Pang.

337
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,440
Though he's the Lord's uncle,

338
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,520
he's never respected me

339
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,370
and keeps challenging my empress's fate.

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,480
Keep an eye on Lady Su.

341
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,130
If she shows any sign of disloyalty
to Bianzhou,

342
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,370
report to me at once.

343
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,210
Yes.

344
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,610
My Lady,

345
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,650
we can't mess up
Lady Xu's birthday banquet.

346
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,960
But we don't know a thing about it.

347
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,440
What do we do?

348
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,040
We may not know,

349
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,810
but there are those who do.

350
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,480
My Lady,

351
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,120
the banquet arrangements

352
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,510
have mostly followed

353
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,680
your instructions.

354
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,570
There are a few details.

355
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,480
Do you want them done differently
this year?

356
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,410
Go away.

357
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,760
Don't bother me.

358
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,040
Put the preparations

359
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
on hold.

360
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,890
You may go.

361
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,370
Yes. I'll take my leave.

362
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,720
It took me a long time

363
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
to figure out just a fraction

364
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,720
of Mother's preferences.

365
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,810
She's new here.

366
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,950
How can she know better than me?

367
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,610
Fine.

368
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,170
Let her handle it

369
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,440
so she can get a taste

370
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,200
of the hardship I once endured.

371
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,410
My Lady,

372
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,680
no need to fret.

373
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,170
She's only been here a short while.

374
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,720
She definitely doesn't know much.

375
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,480
Let her take charge.

376
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
If anything goes wrong,

377
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,890
it won't be our fault.

378
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,170
We'll get to relax.

379
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,890
Here, have some tea.

380
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,850
Greetings, Mother.

381
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,280
You've served Grandmother for years.

382
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,410
Surely, no one knows

383
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,090
her preferences better than you.

384
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,720
Of course.

385
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,330
I've just joined the family

386
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,480
and know very little.

387
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,270
So, I'd like to learn from you.

388
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,500
(Banquet Procedures)

389
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,240
What do you want to learn from me?

390
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,170
You're clever-tongued

391
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,520
and good with words and deeds.

392
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,650
What could I possibly teach you?

393
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,760
I'm someone meticulous.

394
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,200
Mother,

395
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,040
the reason the banquet
was entrusted to me

396
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,890
was that the Lord feared
it'd tire you out.

397
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,810
If the banquet goes poorly,

398
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,520
Grandmother won't be pleased,

399
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,410
and none of us will be at ease.

400
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,370
At least you know your place.

401
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,040
Besides,

402
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,760
many members of the clan will attend.

403
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
If things aren't arranged properly,

404
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,130
it'll bring shame to the Lord's name.

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,130
That won't do.

406
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,170
Exactly.

407
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,090
So,

408
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,720
I'd be grateful if you could tell me

409
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,280
the usual procedures from past years.

410
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
I'll be sure to tell the Lord

411
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,410
and Grandmother

412
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,620
it's thanks to your guidance.

413
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,930
If things go well,

414
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,810
you'll be praised for teaching me well.

415
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,330
If they don't,

416
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,680
I'll shoulder the blame myself.

417
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,370
Then follow this.

418
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,370
Don't give those clan members
any laughingstock.

419
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,250
Besides,

420
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,850
make sure that man

421
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,330
doesn't steal Zhonglin's thunder.

422
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,850
That man.

423
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,200
That man?

424
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,780
That would be the Lord's cousin,

425
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,120
Mr. Wei.

426
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,370
They say he's the illegitimate son

427
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,960
of the Lord's aunt and a servant.

428
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,130
Though his birth is dubious,

429
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,650
he bears the surname of the late lord.

430
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,810
Lady Xu adores him.

431
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,200
He only established his residence
in later years.

432
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,130
I heard from Wei Liang

433
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,810
that Mr. Wei's been traveling nonstop
these years.

434
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,370
He only sends gifts back

435
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,850
during holidays.

436
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,610
So, he didn't even make it back
for your wedding.

437
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,170
So, I should call him Cousin
like the Lord does.

438
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,930
What kind of man is he?

439
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,520
Mr. Wei was wild from a young age,

440
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,280
always carousing
in taverns and brothels.

441
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,890
Rumor has it that half the women here
have ties with him.

442
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,000
If he returns to Yujun,

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,760
the men here better watch out.

444
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,240
No wonder

445
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,130
the women on the streets

446
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,960
have been wearing

447
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,810
heavier makeup lately.

448
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,510
Mr. Wei,

449
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,520
what new fancy things
have you brought this time?

450
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,000
Just the things you love.

451
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,090
Mr. Wei,

452
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,090
come and join us!

453
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,330
Get the drinks and dishes ready.

454
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,330
I'll be there soon.

455
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,370
- Don't forget!
- Yes!

456
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,610
They say he doesn't just flirt outside.

457
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,570
He's got a harem at home too.

458
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,520
He's a total playboy.

459
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,440
Luckily, he rarely stays at the mansion.

460
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,370
Out of ten days, he spends seven
in brothels and taverns,

461
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,960
and only three at home.

462
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Two sprouts from the same field,

463
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,280
two men from the same house.

464
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,170
Luckily,

465
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,610
the Lord isn't like him.

466
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,080
He's truly different.

467
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,440
Forget it. Let's not gossip.

468
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,240
The less we deal with him,
the less trouble we'll have.

469
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,200
Let's just focus
on preparing the banquet.

470
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,250
Yes.

471
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,540
(Government Office)

472
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,810
He's back. He's back.

473
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,040
Mr. Wei.

474
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,280
Lady Xu sent us to welcome you home.

475
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,960
Greetings, Mr. Wei.

476
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
Welcome back.

477
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,780
(Wei Yan, Wei Shao's cousin)

478
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,130
You haven't changed a bit
in these three years.

479
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,570
What miracle elixir did you take?

480
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,370
Mr. Wei,

481
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,480
please don't tease me.

482
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,130
Lady Xu's waiting for you.

483
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,410
It's my fault

484
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,450
for keeping her waiting.

485
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,310
I'll go in right away

486
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,170
to apologize.

487
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,370
Yes, I'll go inform Lady Xu now.

488
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,240
Mother.

489
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,570
Something must be holding Shiyuan up.

490
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,440
No use getting anxious.

491
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,850
He came back for my birthday.

492
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,040
If you can't wait,

493
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,200
you're free to go.

494
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,440
Grandmother.

495
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,680
Grandmother.

496
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,330
Your unfilial grandson is back.

497
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,040
Greetings, Grandmother.

498
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,960
Hurry, hurry. Get up.

499
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,330
Let me take a look at you.

500
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
You've gotten thinner

501
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,090
and more worn out.

502
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,570
Many young ladies say
I'm as handsome as ever.

503
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,930
Yet I can't win your favor.

504
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,760
You must've seen
many charming young men

505
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,890
while I was away

506
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,200
these past three years.

507
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,410
Still the same smooth talker.

508
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,090
The same smooth talker.

509
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,960
Smooth talker.

510
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,570
How is your health?

511
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,930
Everything's good.

512
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,170
Greetings, Aunt.

513
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,410
Zhonglin,

514
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,130
how have you been?

515
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Everything is fine.

516
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,280
I heard you married

517
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,650
an extremely pretty wife.

518
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,660
Why didn't you bring her

519
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,720
to meet me?

520
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,760
Shiyuan is talking nonsense again.

521
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,810
Lady Qiao's been busy preparing

522
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,200
Grandmother's birthday banquet.

523
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,960
I'll bring her

524
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,810
to greet you later.

525
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,130
Good thing you mentioned the banquet.

526
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,730
Come.

527
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,440
I've brought gifts
for all our relatives.

528
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,000
These are for you.

529
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,430
Wait.

530
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,000
I've also got something

531
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,680
for you two.

532
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Here.

533
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,930
This is for you.

534
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,370
This one's for you.

535
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,280
Thank you, Grandmother.

536
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,000
Open them.

537
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,850
This is a pair of rough jade

538
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,040
given to me by your grandfather

539
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,670
when I married him.

540
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,690
Today,

541
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,480
I'm passing them on to you two.

542
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,130
Thank you, Grandmother.

543
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,520
It's a precious gift.

544
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,850
Keep it well.

545
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:24,740
- We will.
- Mother

546
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,040
just dotes on Shiyuan.

547
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,930
Even Zhonglin

548
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,170
benefits from it.

549
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,200
Shiyuan, while you were away,

550
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,260
your grandmother

551
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,650
didn't even give away

552
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,170
a stone,

553
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,200
let alone rough jade, right?

554
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,930
I'm in a good mood today.

555
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,440
Don't push it.

556
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,040
Have a seat.

557
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,930
Alright.

558
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,570
Make sure all gifts
from the states and prefectures

559
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,580
are recorded properly.

560
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,330
Every item must be matched
with the sender.

561
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,760
No mistakes are allowed.

562
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,370
Rest assured, My Lady.

563
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,720
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

564
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,720
Have you picked a birthday gift

565
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
for Grandmother?

566
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,170
I've been looking

567
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,960
but haven't found the right one.

568
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,410
Take a look at this.

569
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,520
It's rough jade.

570
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,200
It was a treasure of Grandmother's,

571
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,200
but she gave it to me today.

572
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,280
It wouldn't be proper for me

573
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,520
to keep it,

574
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,680
so find a skilled artisan

575
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,810
to make it into an accessory.

576
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,200
We'll give it back to her

577
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,650
as a birthday gift.

578
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,440
I've never seen rough jade before,

579
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,570
but this looks pure and translucent.

580
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,040
It's surely fine material.

581
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,650
How about a jade bracelet?

582
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,150
Grandmother would definitely love it.

583
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,520
I'll leave it to you.

584
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,720
Thank you for solving my problem.

585
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,240
When did I solve your problem?

586
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,330
I'm doing this to please Grandmother.

587
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,710
Don't get the wrong idea.

588
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,930
I have other matters. I'm leaving.

589
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,240
Why such a strong denial?

590
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,890
Hello, sir.

591
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,280
Hi, Miss Xiaotao.

592
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,860
I have a big order for you today.

593
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,330
Make a bracelet

594
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,370
for our lady.

595
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Greetings, My Lady.

596
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,610
Wow.

597
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
Such fine quality.

598
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,070
I was lucky to see this once

599
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,330
when I was still an apprentice.

600
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,190
See?

601
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,090
You really haven't seen
much of the world.

602
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
My Lady, are you keeping it

603
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,370
or giving it as a gift?

604
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,000
What style do you want?

605
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,410
It's a gift for an elder at home.

606
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,770
Please carve a blessing bracelet

607
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,090
featuring the dragon and phoenix.

608
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,650
I'll have to give it some thought.

609
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,680
Be careful. Don't drop it.

610
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,850
Be careful.

611
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,720
How is it? Are you okay?

612
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,570
I told you not to drop it.

613
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,450
I'm terribly sorry.

614
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,530
Please forgive me, My Lady.

615
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,400
Alright.

616
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,170
Check if the crack affects the pattern.

617
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,200
The pattern

618
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,330
the Lady wants is delicate.

619
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,720
A crack this big

620
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,090
won't do.

621
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,930
How can you do this?

622
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,570
That guy should be blamed too.

623
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,410
How can he ride on the street now?

624
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,040
What a waste.

625
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,930
It's really my fault.

626
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,850
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,130
Please allow me

628
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,090
to make it up to you.

629
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,170
Come inside and fix it then.

630
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,760
You're kind not to mind,

631
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,930
but I can't let it slide.

632
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,000
Let me see.

633
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
It's top-quality jade.

634
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,850
It'll be a pity to waste
such fine material.

635
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,090
Let me think.

636
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,090
Since it's a gift for an elder,

637
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,930
the lotus Buddha design,

638
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,960
while not as intricate
as the dragon and phoenix,

639
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,090
carries a meaning of blessing.

640
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,040
It might make up for it.

641
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,410
Looks good.

642
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,760
Sir, please take care.

643
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,650
Watch it closely. Don't drop it again.

644
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,330
Be careful this time.

645
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,650
Thanks for the advice, sir.

646
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,570
No problem.

647
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,330
I just happen

648
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,130
to have a new hairpin ready

649
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,910
that needs to go with a high hair bun.

650
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,850
If you

651
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,960
want to thank me,

652
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,280
please try it on.

653
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,040
You're stunning.

654
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,370
This hairpin

655
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,610
suits you perfectly.

656
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,480
Do you think it fits me?

657
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,200
If the Lady isn't interested,

658
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,370
I won't insist.

659
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,570
Mr. Wei, goodbye.

660
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,280
Wei?

661
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,040
Which Wei?

662
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,810
How many Weis are there in Yujun?

663
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,200
This is Mr. Wei?

664
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,410
A real rake.

665
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,610
I heard as soon as he arrived in Yujun,

666
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,090
he took many concubines.

667
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,630
(Wei Yan's Mansion, Wei State)

668
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,040
Mr. Wei is kind

669
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,330
and easy to get along with.

670
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,570
But when you serve him at the mansion,

671
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,960
you must be extra careful.

672
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,720
This isn't a tavern.

673
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,520
He doesn't like flashy or vulgar things,

674
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,370
so you need to pay attention

675
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,240
to your clothes

676
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,280
and makeup.

677
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,000
- Understand?
- Mr. Wei is back.

678
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,440
Mr. Wei is back.

679
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,510
Mr. Wei is back.

680
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,570
Take them to their rooms.

681
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,430
I'll go greet Mr. Wei.

682
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,270
Yes.

683
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,490
Please follow me.

684
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,020
(Lanyun, singer)

685
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,370
Let's go.

686
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,610
What's this?

687
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,650
My Lady.

688
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,240
Isn't this the orchid from Yanzhou?

689
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,280
Yes.

690
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,680
Mr. Wei brought gifts

691
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,370
for all the relatives on this trip.

692
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,580
Knowing that you've been in Yujun
for a while

693
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,560
and might feel homesick,

694
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,620
he had someone pick out

695
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,410
three pots of orchids for you

696
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,000
when passing through Yanzhou.

697
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,280
Unfortunately,

698
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,960
two pots died on the bumpy road,

699
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,480
and only this last one remains,

700
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,810
so I'm here to present it to you.

701
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,930
Please pass on my gratitude to him.

702
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,320
Yes.

703
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,930
It looks

704
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,130
like he picked it carefully.

705
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,480
Such a plant is rare

706
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,170
even in the whole of Yanzhou.

707
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,200
The flowers are nice,

708
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,920
but he's not so great.

709
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,040
Many rich young masters

710
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,960
have strange quirks.

711
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,610
A man like the Lord

712
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,810
is rare.

713
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,850
Find a good gardener

714
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,000
to care for it.

715
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,170
Alright.

716
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,890
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

717
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,240
Okay, I'll record it later.

718
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,410
Then I'll take my leave.

719
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,570
Done. Go then.

720
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,680
Aunt sent a pair
of white jade bracelets.

721
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,680
Let me put them here.

722
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,240
Among so many birthday gifts,

723
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,850
our bracelet is the most beautiful.

724
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,170
Of course.

725
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,200
Don't talk nonsense.

726
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,810
The gifts from the states
are all excellent,

727
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,760
but our rough jade is truly precious,

728
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,370
so the bracelet made
is even more exquisite.

729
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,570
It's obvious that the Lord wants
to gain favor for you

730
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,200
in front of Lady Xu.

731
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,850
He just wants to please Grandmother.

732
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,210
Are all the gifts for the birthday here?

733
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,000
Yes, right here.

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,340
The Lady is here.

735
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,410
Put the gifts on the shelf.

736
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,330
The Lady?

737
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,850
Lady Qiao is here?

738
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,370
I'm Zhonglin's cousin.

739
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,960
Sorry for the trouble today.

740
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,690
Zhonglin will introduce me later,

741
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,410
and then I'll formally greet you.

742
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,440
You must be Mr. Wei.

743
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,560
I haven't thanked you
for the orchids yet.

744
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
It's nothing.

745
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,160
Don't mention it.

746
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,160
Well.

747
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,600
I'll just

748
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,250
leave this...

749
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,810
I'll just leave this

750
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,160
here.

751
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,480
Make sure to take it when you leave.

752
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
Grandmother's birthday banquet
is a big event.

753
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,120
Everyone here must be checked.

754
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,850
If anything happens,
you'll be held responsible.

755
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,710
Understood. Thanks for the reminder.

756
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,650
Let's go.

757
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,440
What's wrong?

758
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,730
The box for the bracelet is missing.

759
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,600
I just put it here a moment ago.

760
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,690
Where did you put it?

761
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,770
Did you put it away and forget?

762
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,080
I put it right here.

763
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,210
Keep looking.

764
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,480
Maybe you put it somewhere else.

765
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,250
I just put it right there.

766
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,210
Did you find it?

767
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,130
No.

768
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,490
The bracelet is gone.

769
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,610
This is definitely our fault.

770
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,740
Please punish us, My Lady.

771
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,690
But everyone who went in and out today

772
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,250
was carefully checked.

773
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,890
No one could've hidden anything.

774
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,640
I even saw the bracelet.

775
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,730
After that,

776
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,290
Mr. Wei came in.

777
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,810
Have you searched Mr. Wei

778
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,120
and everyone who came after?

779
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes, we searched them all.

780
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,600
Mr. Wei even told us not to slack off.

781
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,640
My Lady, please believe us.

782
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,160
We would never be negligent.

783
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,330
Enough, stop talking.

784
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,250
This is the last thing we want to see.

785
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,150
My Lady,

786
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,000
this was a birthday gift
prepared by the Lord

787
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,410
for Lady Xu.

788
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,890
If it's blamed on us,

789
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,000
what will we do?

790
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,160
Maybe

791
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,700
we should keep quiet for a while.

792
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,330
Losing it is already a fault.

793
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,140
If we lie about it,

794
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,850
it will only make things worse.

795
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,770
I didn't do my job well.

796
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,480
Please punish me.

797
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,890
What's going on?

798
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,890
Get up and explain.

799
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,610
What's wrong?

800
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,110
The bracelet for Grandmother

801
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,730
is missing.

802
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,800
What happened?

803
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,160
The storeroom was checked thoroughly.

804
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
No one took it out without permission.

805
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,210
The guards were on duty at the door.

806
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,440
No one left with it.

807
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
But the bracelet is missing.

808
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,120
Everyone in the mansion now knows

809
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,410
you are going to give Grandmother
a bracelet.

810
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,810
Yet it's missing at this moment.

811
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,960
If Grandmother is disappointed,

812
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,370
it's all my fault.

813
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
Please punish me.

814
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,890
It's not so serious.

815
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,640
Don't worry. The storeroom is guarded.

816
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,850
It couldn't have gone missing.

817
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,890
Tomorrow,

818
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,160
we'll search more carefully.

819
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,480
Besides, so what if it's lost?

820
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,730
Don't dwell on it.

821
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,850
Oh, I have something
to do at the office.

822
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,690
I need to go out.

823
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,640
Did the Lord just scold you?

824
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,600
Why does he look so unconcerned?

825
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,570
Cousin.

826
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,160
What's going on?

827
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,930
Why the panic?

828
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,210
Give me rough jade

829
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,080
from Grandmother.

830
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,480
Don't you have one yourself?

831
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,810
I do,

832
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,960
but I had someone make it
into a bracelet.

833
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,120
I wanted to give it
to Grandmother as a gift,

834
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,690
but I lost it.

835
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,850
Lost it?

836
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,160
Who was responsible?

837
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,290
Lady Qiao.

838
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,080
She's the Lady of Wei,

839
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,000
yet she can't handle such a small thing?

840
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,640
No, she's normally careful,

841
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,330
but this time...

842
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,040
It was really an accident.

843
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,520
Now, you're just covering for her.

844
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,370
Listen to me.

845
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,340
Do you know

846
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,280
how important this is?

847
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,560
Enough, just give it to me.

848
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,520
I need it now.

849
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,570
Hurry.

850
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,520
Wait.

851
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,600
You're taking my jade

852
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,410
to make a bracelet

853
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,210
and fix Lady Qiao's mistake,

854
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,040
so we need to recalculate the accounts.

855
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
Brothers don't keep score,

856
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,370
right?

857
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,730
No, no. Look.

858
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,600
You're taking my jade
to make a bracelet,

859
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,930
so I won't get it back.

860
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,210
Lady Qiao said

861
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,640
the bracelet might not be lost.

862
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,600
When we find it,

863
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
we'll return it.

864
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,290
This must be investigated seriously.

865
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,370
Go ahead.

866
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,900
(Jade Artifacts)

867
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,370
Who's there?

868
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,330
How strange.

869
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,250
How could things go missing

870
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,330
in our own house?

871
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,560
Was there a thief?

872
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,810
Lady Qiao, are you here?

873
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,370
Cousin.

874
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,250
Please forgive me for coming uninvited.

875
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,560
I heard

876
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,040
that Zhonglin's precious bracelet
was lost that day.

877
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,250
I happened to be at the storeroom too,

878
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,560
so I wanted

879
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,480
to help you search.

880
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,080
Thanks a lot, Cousin.

881
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,440
Lady Qiao, don't worry.

882
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,930
This mansion is heavily guarded.

883
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,290
Such an important item

884
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,410
can't get lost.

885
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,160
Maybe it was

886
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,330
accidentally left somewhere.

887
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,640
Lady Qiao, take a look.

888
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,690
Is this the bracelet?

889
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,480
That's it.

890
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,480
Where did you find it?

891
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
In that ceramic jar over there.

892
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,330
See?

893
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,440
I told you it wouldn't be lost.

894
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
Maybe someone bumped it off.

895
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,160
This rough jade is top quality,

896
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,330
and it was a gift from Grandmother.

897
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,850
If I'd lost it through carelessness,

898
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,600
I'd feel terribly guilty.

899
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,570
Thank you

900
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,730
for your help today.

901
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,420
No problem.

902
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,730
This rough jade

903
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,080
was from Grandfather to Grandmother

904
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,640
when she married him.

905
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,730
It really is precious material.

906
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,470
Grandmother gave it to Zhonglin,

907
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,160
so you can imagine
the meaning behind it.

908
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,160
From now on,

909
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,080
you must be extra careful

910
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,640
and not make any more mistakes.

911
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,600
You're right.

912
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,250
This rough jade

913
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,810
is truly a rare treasure.

914
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,040
Even in Yujun,

915
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,890
it's one of a kind.

916
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,560
That means

917
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,030
you must have recognized this rough jade

918
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,810
at the jewelry shop that day

919
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,000
and figured out who I was.

920
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,370
You really are clever.

921
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,740
If you knew who I was,

922
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,930
why still pretend in front of me?

923
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,210
They say the Twin Belles
of Yanzhou are stunning.

924
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,960
I just wanted to see for myself

925
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,600
and judge for myself.

926
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,250
What can you do to me?
