30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,740
Greetings, Grandmother.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,330
You may rise.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,740
Thank you, Grandmother.

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,550
Mrs. Wei made

34
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,290
these shoes for you, ma'am.

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,640
The gifts from Lady Xu.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,850
Please accept them, Mrs. Wei.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,660
Thank you, Grandmother.

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,990
You know my duties keep me busy,

39
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,010
so you wouldn't let me visit earlier.

40
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,110
But today,

41
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,390
I've brought my wife

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,410
to pay respects to you.

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,530
From now on, household matters

44
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,200
can be managed by her.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,320
I know you're busy.

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,550
You are excused

47
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,900
from all these formalities.

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,270
Go on with your business.

49
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,940
I shall have a chat with Lady Qiao.

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,090
Yes.

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,300
I heard you offered Panyi as dowry

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,700
and helped Zhonglin
restore the Yongning Canal.

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,220
Yes.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,420
Now that I've married the Lord,

55
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,140
the Qiao and Wei families are one.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,740
I will give my utmost

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,180
to aid him in restoring the canal.

58
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,340
Yongning Canal has
been cut off for 14 years.

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,900
How long it will stay flowing this time?

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,220
As long as we are of one mind,

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
we'll keep it last for generations.

62
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,380
I've heard your grandfather
was skilled in divination.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,860
What do you

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,060
think about this?

65
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,940
Grandfather was skilled in divination,

66
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,260
divining for the people,

67
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,540
and casting lots for peace.

68
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,940
Yet at times, following fate alone

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,420
would go against his true heart.

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,300
Before Grandfather passed away,

71
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,100
he was trapped in guilt and regret.

72
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,700
Perhaps,

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,140
this is the price
for peering into Heaven's will.

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,020
Anyway.

75
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,700
Now that you're part of our family,

76
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,380
these old stories

77
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,700
should be left in the past.

78
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,420
There aren't many strict rules here.

79
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,700
You don't need to greet me every day.

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
If you wish to show respect,

81
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,660
transcribe scriptures for me.

82
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,940
Alright.

83
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,900
(Boya)

84
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,340
It has been over a month

85
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,660
since we parted at Panyi.

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,860
I miss you and hope you are well.

87
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,580
I send this letter
to express my concern.

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,260
Now you and Bi Zhi
are far from home

89
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,700
and with no one to lean on,

90
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,860
if you are in need,

91
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,180
write to me.

92
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,180
I will do my best

93
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,540
to help you out.

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,220
Also,

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,660
regarding the matter we discussed

96
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,620
before parting in Panyi,

97
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,740
how is it going?

98
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,060
If there are any difficulties,

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,740
I will do all I can to assist.

100
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,380
It concerns the lifeblood of Yanzhou

101
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,020
and must be pursued with all effort.

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,540
Lord of Wei treats me well.

103
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
No worries.

104
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,900
What did Mrs. Wei say?

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,860
Manman said

106
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,460
she hopes we live well

107
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,980
and find peace in Boya

108
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,180
to live a good life.

109
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,130
It's getting late.

110
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,850
Go to sleep.

111
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,220
It's cold outside.

112
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
Yeah.

113
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,180
I'll set up a braizer in a bit.

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,860
What are you doing out here?

115
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,500
It's raining,
why did you come out?

116
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,460
Hurry and come inside.

117
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,220
Why aren't you asleep?
What brings you out?

118
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,380
I saw it started raining.

119
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,580
- So…
- Stay right here.

120
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
These can't get wet.

121
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,380
Let me help.

122
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,260
No, no need.

123
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,180
Don't get soaked.

124
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,260
I got this.

125
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,500
Didn't I tell you to rest inside?

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,460
Why did you come out?

127
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,060
The rain's pouring out here.

128
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,770
It's raining so hard.

129
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,020
I was worried you'd get cold.

130
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,980
The neighbors all say

131
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,540
we're like a married couple.

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,620
Such strength.

133
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,020
He's really strong.

134
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
Master Wang,

135
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,780
can it be made

136
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
into an instrument?

137
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,020
What kind of instrument?

138
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,100
About this tall,

139
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,900
and then,

140
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,940
it should be this big, just like this.

141
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,380
You want to make a konghou?

142
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,100
Yes, a konghou.

143
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,820
Great wood.

144
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,060
I'll start tomorrow.

145
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,940
Alright.

146
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
My Lady.

147
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,580
Greetings, Mother.

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,060
Why are you late

149
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,500
in greeting today?

150
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,460
I was accompanying my husband
to greet Grandmother,

151
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,700
hence the delay.

152
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,860
Do you mean

153
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,580
you only pay respect to Grandmother

154
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,260
and neglect Lady Zhu?

155
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
It was my fault.

156
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,180
As long as you admit your mistake.

157
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,580
Lady Zhu is forgiving

158
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,540
and will not make things hard for you.

159
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,380
But this morning,

160
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,620
she waited for you

161
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,140
in vain.

162
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,020
So now,

163
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,380
she still hasn't eaten.

164
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,700
Can you go to the kitchen

165
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,660
and make some soup?

166
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,500
What?

167
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,740
Are you unwilling?

168
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,380
I wouldn't dare.

169
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,380
Preparing soup for my mother-in-law

170
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,780
is my duty.

171
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,820
But, I don't think

172
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,980
I can do it today.

173
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,140
Grandmother

174
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,820
instructed me to transcribe
The Infinite Life Sutra.

175
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,540
The scriptures are lengthy.

176
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,900
Even working day and night,

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,100
I may not finish.

178
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,060
Are you using my mother-in-law

179
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,260
to pressure me now?

180
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
I would never dare.

181
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,540
I simply thought,

182
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,620
what Grandmother wishes

183
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,300
must also be your wishes.

184
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,700
So I wouldn't dare take it lightly.

185
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,780
Besides, transcribing scriptures

186
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
requires a vegetarian diet.

187
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,420
The kitchen

188
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,870
is full of meat and fish.

189
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,310
Entering now might not be proper.

190
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,540
I fear it could be unclean.

191
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,140
How about this?

192
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,180
After I finish transcribing,

193
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,220
I'll personally serve you.

194
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,820
If there's nothing else,

195
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,860
I will

196
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,100
take my leave.

197
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,020
And you said she wouldn't dare?

198
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,700
She dares plenty.

199
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,700
Go tell Zhonglin
to come over for dinner.

200
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,220
I want to ask him myself.

201
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,540
Does he want that wife,

202
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
or his mother?

203
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,020
Yes.

204
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,780
(Boya)
Hurry up.

205
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,740
Quickly now.

206
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,980
Go.

207
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,420
Stop right there.

208
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,660
Wang,

209
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,260
you're from Juejun.

210
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,700
Do you think
moving to Boya means

211
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,740
no military service?

212
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,620
Come with us.

213
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,620
Sir, please have mercy.

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,100
I'm over 60.

215
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
I can't march or fight anymore.

216
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,460
If I tell you to enlist, you do it.

217
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Don't argue.

218
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,660
Looking for trouble?

219
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,260
Take him!

220
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,140
Yes, sir.

221
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,620
You'll see.

222
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,380
I'll be back.

223
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,460
Mark my words.

224
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,300
Sir.

225
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,580
Thank you, sir.

226
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Everyone, please get up.

227
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,700
Please.

228
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,340
Thank you, sir.

229
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,820
Everyone,

230
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,580
just call me Bi Zhi.

231
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,460
Bi Zhi,

232
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,180
Xue Tai craves battle

233
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,020
and keeps conscripting.

234
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,620
Now all the able men are gone,

235
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,260
even the old and young get taken now.

236
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,620
If they dare come again,

237
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,060
I'll drive them away once more.

238
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Bi Zhi,

239
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,580
you are righteous.

240
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,940
We all respect you.

241
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,900
Now is the time for you to step up

242
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,020
and lead us to a way out.

243
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,900
- That's right.
- Indeed.

244
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,060
Yes. We must survive.

245
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,340
Yes.

246
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,260
But I just married my wife,

247
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,020
I only wish

248
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,540
to live in peace with her.

249
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,420
Just now you drove the officer away.

250
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,820
Xue Tai will surely retaliate.

251
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
When that happens,

252
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,460
how will

253
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,540
your wife live in peace?

254
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,780
That's right.

255
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,940
Exactly.

256
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,310
But I only know

257
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,980
how to raise horses.

258
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,460
As for anything else,

259
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm clueless.

260
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,180
I've read a few books

261
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,260
and I know a just cause is
essential to rally people.

262
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,020
Right now,

263
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,060
we need a title

264
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,260
to rally behind.

265
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,500
Then how about

266
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,380
Commander of Boya Forces?

267
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
Perfect title.

268
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,140
I'll serve as your chief advisor

269
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,860
and help plan our strategies.

270
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,940
We miners

271
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,460
are strong.

272
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,340
We're willing to follow you.

273
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,340
Bi Zhi, let's run away.

274
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,460
Back in Kangjun, Manman often spoke

275
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,220
of two fierce generals.

276
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,380
One is Li Su.

277
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,220
The other is Xue Tai.

278
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,040
He's known for being ruthless.

279
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,140
Strong troops, fierce army.

280
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,660
We've now crossed him.

281
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,460
Boya is no longer safe.

282
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,380
But where could we possibly escape to?

283
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,860
Everywhere is in chaos.

284
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,660
I must become stronger myself.

285
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,980
If I seize control of Boya,

286
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,220
only then can I protect you.

287
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,100
You've kept me safe all this time.

288
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,460
I've been truly happy.

289
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,340
This is nothing.

290
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,460
What I wish to give you

291
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,740
is far more than just this.

292
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,860
I don't want you wandering homeless,

293
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,420
living as a village woman in the wilds.

294
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,380
As long as I'm with you,

295
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,700
none of that matters to me at all.

296
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
Fan,

297
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
it matters to me.

298
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,180
The reason

299
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,940
I want to become master of Boya

300
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,020
is more than just that.

301
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,820
Now that Xue Tai is conscripting men,

302
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,100
I suppose,

303
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,740
he means to put pressure on Panyi.

304
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,820
Wei will surely be troubled by this.

305
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,500
If

306
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,620
I manage to intercept Xue Tai at Boya,

307
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,420
it would fulfill the promise
I made to Mrs. Wei

308
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,900
that day in Panyi forest:

309
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,380
To serve Mrs. Wei faithfully.

310
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,540
General.

311
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,500
General.

312
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,780
(Wei Mansion)
Mother, you asked me to come.

313
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,020
Anything I should know?

314
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,900
I made you a new pair of shoes.

315
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,900
Your older brother, Bogong,

316
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,760
was the same.

317
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,780
Every time he came home,

318
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,380
he would always wear the shoes I made.

319
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,580
Go on, try them on.

320
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,660
Zhonglin,

321
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,980
the Qiao Family and our Wei Family

322
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,580
have deep enmity.

323
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,740
So when Lady Qiao entered our household,

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,660
I felt instant dislike.

325
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
But Chuyu kept telling me

326
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,740
to treat her kindly.

327
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,940
Otherwise,

328
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,900
it'd put you in a difficult position

329
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,220
between us.

330
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,100
All these years,

331
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,860
you've been tied up with work.

332
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
I've had no one

333
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,740
by my side.

334
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,100
But Chuyu's brought me comfort.

335
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,600
Do you know

336
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,460
why I want you to take Chuyu in?

337
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,220
If she marries you,

338
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,660
she can stay close to me.

339
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,860
No matter what,

340
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,020
we know Chuyu well.

341
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,620
She would never harm you.

342
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,860
Right?

343
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,060
I understand

344
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,980
what you mean, Mother.

345
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
But as for this matter,

346
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,660
I need some time to think.

347
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,060
What are you reading?

348
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,380
The Infinite Life Sutra for Grandmother.

349
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,140
This box here.

350
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,100
Don't touch it again.

351
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,500
Even if you hadn't said it, I wouldn't.

352
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,380
I was just careless earlier.

353
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,540
Are these new shoes?

354
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,940
Mother made them herself.

355
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,300
Since you have new shoes on,

356
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,340
why not try the pair I made?

357
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,620
They fit quite well.

358
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,020
Then I'll just

359
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,540
take Mother's pair back for now.

360
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,700
I'll try to improve my skills.

361
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,020
Alright.

362
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,660
You really are thoughtful.

363
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,940
As your wife, I should be.

364
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,980
Then why did you

365
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,820
make excuses and leave,

366
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,180
using sutra copying as an excuse

367
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,940
when Mother asked you

368
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,900
to make some soup today?

369
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,940
Sutra copying

370
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,300
was indeed an excuse.

371
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,700
But not making soup

372
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,900
wasn't my real intention.

373
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,500
What do you mean?

374
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,620
Today, Ms. Jiang
asked me to make soup.

375
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,620
But back home, I was too lazy

376
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,060
to cook.

377
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,660
I had no idea where to begin.

378
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,780
No one was there to guide me either.

379
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,860
Even if I dared to cook,

380
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm afraid no one would taste it.

381
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,860
Why didn't you just say so?

382
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,700
I knew Mother despised me.

383
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,140
Back then outside the city,

384
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,900
she didn't allow me in for three days.

385
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,860
Later, she even
sent people to drive me away.

386
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,220
If I had told the truth now,

387
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,700
she probably would have thought

388
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,780
I was just making excuses,

389
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,540
and disliked me even more.

390
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,780
You remember it clearly.

391
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,060
Three days in the wind and rain.

392
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,220
I'll never forget it.

393
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Since you get her attitude,

394
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,860
she wants me to do something.

395
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,640
I'll leave it to you to handle.

396
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
Whatever you need, just say it.

397
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,140
Mother

398
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,740
wants me to take Zheng Shu
as a concubine.

399
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,820
So you want me to refuse
on your behalf?

400
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,620
No.

401
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,940
I need you to arrange it.

402
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,540
Does the Lord want to take Zheng Shu?

403
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,180
Didn't he once say,

404
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,060
out of respect for your honor,

405
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,300
he'd never take a concubine?

406
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,220
Why changed now?

407
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,660
I was wrong.

408
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,740
We were never an ordinary couple.

409
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,540
How could he care for me?

410
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,060
Refusing the concubine proposal

411
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,220
was just to prevent

412
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,100
his uncles from making a fuss.

413
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,580
He used me as a shield.

414
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,220
How ridiculous.

415
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Mrs. Wei,

416
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,940
should we still redo these shoes?

417
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,820
Yes.

418
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,940
Why not?

419
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,580
I can't blame anyone else.

420
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,660
I just didn't think far enough.

421
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,940
Is he taking Zheng Shu
as a concubine?

422
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,300
Mother likes Zheng Shu,

423
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,300
so she wants her to
be a concubine.

424
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,420
Though I don't have her favor,

425
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,860
I can't let her push me around.

426
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,180
Since she wants to control me,

427
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,260
then I must find someone

428
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,660
who can keep her in check.

429
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,740
Lady Xu,

430
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,980
Mrs. Wei is here.

431
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,380
Grandmother.

432
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
I told you

433
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,540
not to greet me daily.

434
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,180
You are kind and excused me,

435
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,540
but,

436
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,140
my heart is full of respect.

437
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,740
Today I came

438
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,180
because I have a question for you.

439
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,500
Go ahead.

440
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,980
I've been copying the Sutra,

441
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,620
but forgot to ask
which script you prefer.

442
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,060
Seal script is graceful.

443
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,500
Clerical script feels solid.

444
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,060
Cursive script is lively.

445
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,380
Regular script is elegant.

446
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,260
I dare not decide on my own,

447
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,740
so I wrote about 100 characters of each

448
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,100
for Grandmother to choose.

449
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,020
Then use regular script.

450
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,340
There's one more thing.

451
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,260
Please choose another style

452
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,500
for the formal recognition

453
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,060
of Zheng Shu as his concubine.

454
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,380
I'm inexperienced,

455
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,900
and dare not decide on my own.

456
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,380
I came to consult you,

457
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,180
so I wouldn't embarrass my husband.

458
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
You came to air your grievances,

459
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,340
right?

460
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,660
I wouldn't dare.

461
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,580
If you have something to say,
just say it.

462
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,520
Earlier, my husband

463
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,660
rejected his uncles' proposal

464
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,180
to take a concubine for my sake.

465
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,260
If he wishes to now,

466
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,780
he needs a better reason

467
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,580
so his uncles don't grow resentful.

468
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,620
I understand.

469
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,500
You don't need

470
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,860
to handle this anymore.

471
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,060
Mother,

472
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,660
Chuyu is grateful

473
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,260
and wants to repay you.

474
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,820
If you grant her to Zhonglin,

475
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,660
it would strengthen family ties.

476
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,900
I simply want to find someone

477
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,540
Zhonglin likes.

478
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,740
But who likes her?

479
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,740
You?

480
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,500
Is this for Zhonglin,

481
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,860
or for yourself?

482
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,340
Last time,

483
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,900
we talked about this,

484
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,660
and I did not agree.

485
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,900
Yes. Lady Xu

486
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,020
had prepared Zheng Shu's dowry.

487
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,620
She added more because of her hard work.

488
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
That's enough

489
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,660
for the Zheng family to find her

490
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,180
a good match elsewhere.

491
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,420
But Zhonglin is always busy
with official duties,

492
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,660
and often away at war,

493
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,780
he's already delayed Zheng Shu's future.

494
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,060
That Lady Qiao. If it weren't for her…

495
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,220
Then it's settled.

496
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,540
Leave it for now.

497
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,420
My Lady,

498
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,740
here's the list of gifts.

499
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,620
Please take a look.

500
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,300
Yes.

501
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,860
You're back.

502
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,300
About taking a concubine,

503
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,740
you went behind my back

504
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,340
and asked for Grandmother's support.

505
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,820
It was only right

506
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
for Grandmother to know.

507
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
As for what decision she makes,

508
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,140
it's not something I can control.

509
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,100
Good.

510
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,620
Truly, you can't change this matter.

511
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,780
It was decided

512
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,380
by Grandmother and me.

513
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,660
Not you.

514
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,020
Don't jump to conclusions.

515
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,380
Yes.

516
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,820
I dare not interfere.

517
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,200
What?

518
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,420
Feeling upset?

519
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,940
I'm not.

520
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,740
Whatever you think

521
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,980
is what I think.

522
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,780
Then it's settled.

523
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,460
Go ahead. I'll head to the office.

524
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,580
No need.

525
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,700
Since you've returned,

526
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,260
I shouldn't occupy your study.

527
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
Please have a seat.

528
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,420
You didn't move anything here,
did you?

529
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,980
Today, I was only copying the sutra

530
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,900
in here for Grandmother.

531
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,540
If you're uneasy,

532
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,220
I'll move to the bedroom tomorrow.

533
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,140
Just asking, nothing more.

534
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,540
I wasn't accusing you.

535
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,220
From now on,

536
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,460
you have the access to the study.

537
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,260
Since you trust me,

538
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,900
I won't let you down.

539
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,300
Why are you here?

540
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,180
Aunt was worried about you.

541
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,980
She asked me

542
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,300
to bring you some soup.

543
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,300
The weather is turning cold.

544
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,860
Don't wander around.

545
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,620
I understand

546
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,940
your concern.

547
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,380
I mean, us being alone like this

548
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,620
would harm your good name.

549
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,100
Aunt already intends

550
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,700
to marry me to you.

551
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,060
If not for Lady Qiao…

552
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,420
This has nothing to do with her.

553
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,980
It was Grandmother's decision.

554
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,700
Shao,

555
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,460
you've just been swayed by her.

556
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,300
I'm not hungry. Take it away.

557
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,180
Shao.

558
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,340
Leave. Go now.

559
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,140
Shao.

560
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,380
Without my permission,

561
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,460
you're not to enter.

562
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Understood.

563
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,060
(Boya)

564
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,140
(Xue)

565
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,660
(Xue Tai, General of Bianzhou)

566
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,420
General.

567
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,460
The one with green eyes is Bi Zhi.

568
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,980
He was born with great strength,

569
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,820
and can train horses.

570
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,180
A mere hundred men.

571
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,500
They're no real threat.

572
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,220
Take that.

573
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,260
Bi Zhi can even hold his own
against the General.

574
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,420
Impressive.

575
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,220
Hyah.

576
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,220
Xue Tai is backed by Bianzhou.
Their strength is vast.

577
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,340
How can Boya resist such power?

578
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,580
For now,

579
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,340
we must ask Kangjun for help.

580
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,940
(May Father put aside the past
and help my husband repel the invaders.)

581
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,380
She eloped with a stableman,

582
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,420
abandoning her family and clan.

583
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,820
Now she has the nerve to write for aid.

584
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,340
My Lord,

585
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,820
Bianzhou has long coveted Boya.

586
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,740
If we send troops now,

587
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,060
we may offend Bianzhou.

588
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,260
Besides, Boya is close to Panyi.

589
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,140
I'm afraid even Lord of Wei

590
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,140
might misunderstand.

591
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,820
Yue,

592
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,540
Fan is a daughter of the Qiao Family.

593
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,540
We can't just sit by and do nothing,

594
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,900
turning our backs on blood ties.

595
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,340
- Indeed.
- That's right.

596
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,620
You're the Governor of Yanzhou,

597
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,220
so the decision is yours.

598
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,140
You know Uncle is the Governor,

599
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,340
yet you meddle in everything.

600
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,820
What are your intentions?

601
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,500
Are you trying to sway Uncle

602
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,620
into such a heartless act?

603
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,620
Ci,

604
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,580
mind your manners.

605
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Ci,

606
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,980
your grandfather once forsook an ally

607
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,060
to protect Yanzhou.

608
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,660
Great deeds

609
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,180
require sacrifice of sentiment.

610
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,100
You're still young.

611
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,260
Some things

612
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
take time to understand.

613
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,140
Offending Bianzhou is minor,

614
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,100
what matters is Wei.

615
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,260
Boya borders Panyi,

616
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,100
Wei Shao has thousands
of elite soldiers in Panyi.

617
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,620
If we send troops to Boya now,

618
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,700
what will Wei Shao think?

619
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,420
My Lord, you're right.

620
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,660
The decision is made.

621
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,380
Yanzhou can send for Fan,

622
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,300
but sending troops

623
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,620
is out of the question.

624
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,700
My Lady,

625
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,020
Lord asks you to the study,

626
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,540
he says it's urgent.

627
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,820
Why did he return so early today?

628
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,620
If I hadn't come back early,

629
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,020
I would've discovered this.

630
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,220
What do you mean by that?

631
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,940
You opened this box, didn't you?

632
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,100
(General of Bianzhou)

633
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,980
Don't touch this box.

634
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,940
You made the scratches, right?

635
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
It wasn't me.

636
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,460
I just picked it up and put it back.

637
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,500
I don't know who scratched it like this.

638
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,620
Who else could it be but you?

639
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,100
Who else can enter this room?

640
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,180
Do you believe

641
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,940
there's some military intel in there?

642
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,780
I came here

643
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,740
only to return The Infinite Life Sutra.

644
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,340
And I was afraid you'd suspect me,

645
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,060
so I reported to you in advance.

646
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,980
If I truly meant to break into it,

647
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,540
or spy on military intel,

648
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,420
why would I

649
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,180
tell you about my actions?

650
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,420
You told me

651
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,980
to clear yourself of suspicion.

652
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,260
But I had no idea there
was military intel in the box.

653
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,580
True,

654
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,220
I was curious about the box

655
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,980
and the military intel within.

656
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,620
But I never opened it.

657
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,500
Though we are married,

658
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,220
I never meant to use that

659
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,380
- to…
- Quiet.

660
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,580
Still defending yourself?

661
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,660
I did not.

662
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,100
Everyone in the Qiao Family

663
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,700
is untrustworthy.

664
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,220
You lie as breathing.

665
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,460
It runs in your bloodline.

666
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,100
Listen up.

667
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,780
Our marriage can't

668
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,380
erase the grudge between Qiao and Wei.

669
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,820
From now on,

670
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,180
if you touch my things again,

671
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,740
you can go back to Kangjun.

672
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,580
Understand?

673
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,500
Mrs. Wei.

674
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,380
Are you alright?

675
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,220
Mrs. Wei,

676
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,900
he just left in a rage.

677
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,380
What happened?

678
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,340
Your hand is ice cold.

679
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,500
Just a misunderstanding.

680
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,140
He insists I touched his box.

681
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,820
Help me investigate

682
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,020
who else has been in the study.

683
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,580
Don't worry, My Lady.

684
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,540
We'll find out for you.

685
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,500
They all said

686
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,860
they didn't hear, see,

687
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,740
or know.

688
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,260
Funny how they heard, saw,

689
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
and knew everything when they were

690
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
laughing at us.

691
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,620
Clearly, they're all in it together,

692
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,380
guarding against us.

693
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,900
Now we're restrained at every turn.

694
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,020
We need to place

695
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,740
our own people.

696
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,940
Mrs. Wei,

697
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,620
this matter could turn serious.

698
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,420
Perhaps we should inform Lady Xu

699
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,820
and let her decide.

700
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,460
Grandmother

701
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,060
is still of the Wei family.

702
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,500
If I rely on her for everything,

703
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,660
the day she tires of me,

704
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,460
I'll be left to be cut down by others.

705
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,540
People say I am gentle as water,

706
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,100
thinking a dam can hold me back,

707
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,140
but there's one thing they forget.

708
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,020
Only when water flows smoothly
is it calm.

709
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,660
If wind blocks or earth hinders it,

710
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,380
all it does is stir up high waves.

711
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,140
My Lady,

712
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,300
why don't we

713
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,780
return to Yanzhou?

714
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,420
I'll start packing now.

715
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,220
Aren't we swallowing injustice here?

716
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,020
Ever since we came to Yujun,

717
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,860
we've been suppressed

718
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,140
and humiliated.

719
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,340
At least in Xindu and Panyi,

720
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,220
we could still find a way out

721
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,700
when things got tough.

722
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,460
The inner residence is
like a battlefield.

723
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,180
Even crueler than war.

724
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,380
You don't even need a blade to kill.

725
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,540
Since it's a battlefield,

726
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,020
then we must capture the leader first.

727
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,380
Dealing with Lady Zhu

728
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,740
and Zheng Shu

729
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,900
won't help us.

730
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,220
The one holding the blade is
still Wei Shao.

731
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,900
If this matter isn't settled,

732
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,500
I'll always be at his mercy.

733
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,180
I may be in a weak position,

734
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,940
but I won't leave my fate to chance.

735
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,540
Zhen Zhi has been sent
to Xindu to repair the levees,

736
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,860
and Yang Feng is stationed at Panyi

737
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,100
to build sluice gates.

738
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,140
Once both sides finish,

739
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,220
the Yongning Canal can flow again.

740
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,220
Is the construction going smoothly?

741
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,980
They've done it once before

742
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,580
as they were involved in the project
when they were young,

743
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,140
so it's not difficult.

744
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,900
But Zhen Zhi

745
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,140
still hasn't changed.

746
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,700
Even if something's wrong,

747
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,380
he'd rather write to me for help

748
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,900
than ask Yang Feng.

749
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,900
You wouldn't believe

750
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,860
how badly they fought in their youth.

751
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,860
The late Lord of Wei and Lord Qiao…

752
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,300
Qiao Gui got dragged into it.

753
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,500
My Lord,

754
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,060
is something troubling you?

755
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,780
Shall we discuss this later?

756
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,180
No need.

757
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,460
What were you saying?

758
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,470
My Lord.

759
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,100
Why are you here?

760
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,740
To prove my innocence.

761
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,300
You must not touch the box.

762
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,660
I just need a moment

763
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,940
to prove my innocence.

764
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,740
I said you cannot touch it.

765
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,860
If I can't touch it,

766
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,900
how can I prove my innocence?

767
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,780
Because I'm from the Qiao clan,

768
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,780
you all suspect and condemn me.

769
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,820
Will I never redeem myself?

770
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,260
Isn't the Qiao Family wrong?

771
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,340
Is it me who's wrong

772
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,780
or the whole Qiao family?

773
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,580
I thought after marrying you,

774
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,100
you'd treat me with sincerity.

775
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,700
I didn't expect you
to guard against me at every turn.

776
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,420
Because I'm from the Qiao clan,

777
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,540
you see me as your eternal enemy.

778
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,780
Yet my marriage to you

779
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,580
was never to steal intel.

780
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,500
That's why I must
prove my innocence today.

781
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,500
The blocks on the nine-square lock
represent numbers.

782
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,460
Whether horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally,

783
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,220
they all add up to 15,

784
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,220
with five in the center,

785
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,180
forming eight different magic squares.

786
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,740
It's not difficult.

787
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,860
Anyone trained in calculation
can unlock it.

788
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,300
If I had stolen the intel

789
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,860
and taken the token inside,

790
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,780
you could see me as a spy,

791
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,860
and punish me as you wish.

792
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,300
But if you're merciful,

793
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,820
still remember our bond,

794
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,980
yet hesitate with doubt,

795
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,780
then wouldn't that play right
into your enemy's trap?

796
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,900
Today, I'm your wife,

797
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,300
yet you don't trust me,

798
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,220
and suspect I stole military intel.

799
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,100
What about when we share a bed?

800
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,580
Won't you fear I'll strike you
in your sleep,

801
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,860
dagger in hand?

802
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,100
I came here to prove myself

803
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,220
so such a day

804
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,660
never comes.

805
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,860
I could have unlocked the box,

806
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,300
but I didn't.

807
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,900
Inside is something

808
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,380
precious to you.

809
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,580
To scar it with a knife

810
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,700
is to scar your heart.

811
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I will never do that.

812
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,140
After all, I know how to unlock it.

813
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,940
Smooth talk.

814
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,300
When you stormed out just now,

815
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,900
I reflected on myself.

816
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,900
I did touch the box,

817
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,220
whether I unlocked it or not,

818
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,620
it was ignoring your warning.

819
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,820
I was wrong, and I accept punishment.

820
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,220
I vow never to repeat this.

821
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,540
If one day,

822
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,580
you forget how to open it,

823
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,140
you may come to me anytime.

824
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,340
What's wrong with you?

825
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,220
What?

826
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,740
Mrs. Wei speaks with reason.

827
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,980
It's too convincing.

828
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,310
No wonder back in Xindu and Panyi,

829
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,590
she could rally the people well.

830
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,070
It's just family matters.

831
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,540
That's it.

832
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,060
But I once said
she had the grace of water.

833
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Was that wrong?

834
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,300
It was spot on.

835
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,220
She is so sharp and bold,

836
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,700
hardly gentle like water.

837
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,060
You don't get it.

838
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,020
An arrow flies farther
when drawn harder.

839
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,300
And water, when stirred,
leads to drought.

840
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
No wonder he calls her fierce.

841
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,540
All of you, leave now.

842
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,900
Let's go.

843
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,940
Child,

844
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,100
as a son of the Wei family,

845
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,420
you were born
to fight on the battlefield.

846
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,980
You must be like your brother.

847
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,940
In valor and strategy,

848
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,300
neither your father nor I

849
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,060
can compare to him.
