30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,770
If you knew who I was,

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,720
why still pretend in front of me?

32
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,050
They say The Twin Belles of Yanzhou
are stunning.

33
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,770
I just wanted to see for myself

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,410
and judge for myself.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,050
What can you do to me?

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,520
No one in the Wei family

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,730
is easy to deal with.

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,520
Back at the shop, Mr. Wei

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,080
already knew you were Lady Wei,

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
yet he still made indecent remarks.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,890
Now he's returned the bangle,

42
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,960
clearly trying to get closer.

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,290
Who knows? Maybe he was the one

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,050
who hid the bangle in the first place.

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,290
He's way too shameless.

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,640
What if he crosses the line again?

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,930
What should we do then?

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
That's exactly what worries me.

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,080
Should we tell His Lordship?

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,770
In case Mr. Wei twists the story first.

51
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,340
Xiaotao, we have no proof.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,970
If His Lordship thinks

53
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,120
Her Ladyship is sowing discord between them,

54
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,610
it won't end well.

55
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,890
Then...

56
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,330
What should we do?

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,090
The bangle was lost.

58
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,360
I can tell His Lordship
and discuss it with him.

59
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,170
But his cousin's indecent words...

60
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,930
I truly don't know how to bring it up.

61
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:38,660
(Jade Artifacts)

62
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,610
Let's go.

63
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,980
(Jade Artifacts)

64
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,460
My Lord, you're back.

65
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,010
No need to worry

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,960
about the jade bangle.

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
What's this?

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,770
I found the jade bangle.

69
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,610
You did?

70
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,610
You're right, My Lord.

71
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,680
I don't have to worry about it anymore.

72
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,850
Losing it and getting it back

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
is indeed a blessing.

74
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,090
It's all thanks to Mr. Wei

75
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,410
that I was able to find it.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,410
He found it?

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,650
Yes.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
Strangely enough,

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,120
the bangle went missing
as soon as he arrived that day.

80
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,300
And today, he came again,

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,410
and it was found.

82
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,650
It seems there's fate
between him and the bangle.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,760
Truly, a strange twist of fate.

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
That's why he's so invested.

85
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,760
Why didn't you tell me you had met him?

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
We haven't been

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,530
formally introduced.

88
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,760
Even in the storeroom,

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,610
we only spoke through a screen.

90
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,680
So I was curious what kind of man Mr. Wei is.

91
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,650
Would you like to tell me, My Lord?

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,930
When it comes to winning a woman's heart,

93
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,850
I'm truly no match for him.

94
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
You're back in such a rush.

95
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,660
Where have you just come from?

96
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,540
I spent last night at the Government Office.

97
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,540
You really are diligent.

98
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,460
Diligent?

99
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,420
More like wasted effort.

100
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,860
Take care, sir.

101
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
(Luozhong Tavern)
This way, sir. Come in.

102
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,340
Who is this young lady?

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,100
No, she's dressed like a married woman.

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,300
She must be someone's wife.

105
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,300
Why doesn't this beauty
have her hair up in a bun?

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,620
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Wei.

107
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,540
Mr. Wei.

108
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,660
(Luozhong Tavern)
Come in, sir.

109
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,860
It's been a while.

110
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
My Lord.

111
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
Where is he?

112
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,300
Mr. Wei said if you want him out,

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,780
you gotta ask him inside.

114
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,900
You know I never go to places like this.

115
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,420
You come here a lot. Bring him out.

116
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,780
I come here to flirt with girls,

117
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,300
not to chase after a drunkard.

118
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,140
Never gonna happen.

119
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,660
I'll come again.

120
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,100
Sure, you're always welcome.

121
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,540
Please, come on in.

122
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,220
Sir.

123
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,740
Here for some fun?

124
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,380
(Luozhong Tavern)

125
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,180
Zhonglin.

126
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,740
You're here now. Just enjoy yourself.

127
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,020
Go on,

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,300
make sure Lord Wei has a good time.

129
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,660
- Lord Wei.
- Back off.

131
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,660
Back off!

132
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,540
Alright, it's okay.

133
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,240
Since Lord Wei doesn't need you,

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
you all can leave.

135
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

136
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,460
What are you doing?

137
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,900
You know I hate places like this.

138
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,100
Why do you choose here?

139
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,800
I have a favor

140
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
to ask.

141
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,060
What is it?

142
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,260
You and Grandmother
always tell me to settle down.

143
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,740
Lately,

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,260
I've met a girl I like.

145
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
Help me find her.

146
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,900
Really?

147
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,260
If you're actually thinking about

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,860
settling down and giving up this lifestyle,

149
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,300
I'll help you find her.

150
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,460
Very well.

151
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,020
So,

152
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
who is she?

153
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Where did you meet her?

154
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,020
In Yujun.

155
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,220
But I don't know

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,660
whose wife she is.

157
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
"Wife"?

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,380
Are you kidding me?

159
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,260
You always say nice things,

160
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,380
but when I ask for help,

161
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,780
this is how you act?

162
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,380
You call this a favor?

163
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,920
Flirting with a married woman?

164
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,100
Shame on you!

165
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,380
I can't believe you even said that.

166
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,020
You and Grandmother

167
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,340
keep preaching about my future,

168
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,620
just 'cause I go to

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,860
taverns and brothels

170
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,860
and supposedly brought shame to the family.

171
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,460
If you truly want to settle down,

172
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,660
Grandmother would

173
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,980
pick the best woman

174
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,260
in all of Wei for you.

175
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,110
Forget it.

176
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,740
I'm not like you,

177
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,460
willing to marry

178
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,900
the enemy's daughter just for power.

179
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,380
I can't just swallow that.

180
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,330
You don't get what it means to fall in love.

181
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,020
It's not like...

182
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,900
You only know if it'll work

183
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,100
after you get to know each other.

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,500
That's enough.

185
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,460
I'm not like you.

186
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,500
I don't

187
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,140
waste my time

188
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,980
on just one person.

189
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,220
Alright then.

190
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,020
Tell me

191
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,410
what she looks like.

192
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,460
Don't worry.

193
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,980
I'll find her,

194
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,020
and tell her

195
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,380
to behave herself

196
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,500
and stay away from you.

197
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,140
I knew you weren't being sincere.

198
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,380
Look who's talking.

199
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,660
Zhonglin.

200
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,980
Zhonglin!

201
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Zhonglin.

202
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
You...

203
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,310
Mr. Wei.

204
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,100
Lord Wei dropped his jade token.

205
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,660
Take it to the Wei Mansion

206
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,460
and give it to Lady Wei.

207
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,380
But Lord Wei just left.

208
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,620
I'll run after him

209
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,900
and give it back.

210
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,660
Did you not hear what I said?

211
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,340
Yes, sir.

212
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,500
Let me handle

213
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,020
the Qiao-Wei alliance.

214
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,020
I left you a hidden piece.

215
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
It'll ease your worries.

216
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,860
Please don't forget

217
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,740
your real reason for returning to Wei State.

218
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
He asked you

219
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,380
to help me,

220
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,380
not to instruct me.

221
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,540
I wouldn't dare.

222
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,740
You don't think

223
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,140
I've truly fallen for that lady, do you?

224
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,340
Sir, you're most wise.

225
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,660
It's so late.

226
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Why did His Lordship call us here?

227
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,980
I just got to Luozhong Tavern

228
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,220
and didn't warm my seat yet.

229
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,740
There are so many girls there.

230
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,260
Won't you get dizzy picking one?

231
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,540
You don't get it.

232
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,140
Every girl has her own beauty and charm.

233
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,100
You blockhead wouldn't understand.

234
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,540
What don't I understand?

235
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,220
Yujun girls love flower hairpins.

236
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,780
Yanzhou girls love wearing orchids.

237
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,860
I know that.

238
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,980
Orchids? They are more into

239
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,140
orchids that sway like weathervanes.

240
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,740
Xiao's got a point.

241
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,620
Tan,

242
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,620
come here and smell me.

243
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
See what scent you pick up.

244
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,860
It's the scent of powder.

245
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,460
You went to a brothel today?

246
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,020
You can even sniff that out?

247
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,620
Bring me some clean clothes.

248
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,460
Yes.

249
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,620
Wait. If Lady Wei

250
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,140
sends someone to ask for me,

251
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,620
just tell them I'm too busy

252
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
with work and won't

253
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,460
be coming home.

254
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,900
But Lady Wei hasn't sent anyone.

255
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,060
She hasn't?

256
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,380
She's busy with Lady Xu's birthday banquet.

257
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Even Chunniang, Xiaotao, and Xiaozao are

258
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,620
caught up in the preparations.

259
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,340
So, there's a proper reason.

260
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,860
- My Lord, you called us?
- Good.

261
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,980
Find the woman

262
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,100
in this portrait.

263
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,140
If she's married in a respectable family,

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,020
tell her

265
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,540
to stay far away from my cousin.

266
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,860
Yes.

267
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,900
Go fetch my clothes.

268
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,780
Where is my jade token?

269
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Not here.

270
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,460
Maybe it's in the bedchamber.

271
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,500
I'll go ask Her Ladyship.

272
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,580
Come back.

273
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,620
That's impossible.

274
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,980
I had it when I left this morning.

275
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,740
Send someone to look for it,

276
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,140
but don't make it public.

277
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,020
And

278
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,620
don't let Her Ladyship find out.

279
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
Yes.

280
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,220
My Lady!

281
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,700
My Lady!

282
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,460
Why are you so flustered again?

283
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,540
My Lady,

284
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,780
a tavern maid

285
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,540
from Luozhong Tavern brought it over.

286
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,460
She said His Lordship left it there.

287
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,220
His Lordship went to Luozhong Tavern?

288
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,780
Finding people is Wei Duo's specialty.

289
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,860
He's not here, so His Lordship sent us.

290
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,980
Where do we even start?

291
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,100
What now?

292
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,100
Post a notice?

293
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,020
Offer a reward?

294
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,860
Are you crazy?

295
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,620
Are we to declare to the whole city

296
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,980
who has stolen Mr. Wei's heart?

297
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,660
Forget it. Just open it.

298
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,620
On it.

299
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,900
No idea who tied this.

300
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,260
It takes forever to open...

301
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,740
Duang,

302
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,500
out for a stroll?

303
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,980
Is that Xiaotao over there?

304
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,140
No way.

305
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,620
She's much thinner than Xiaotao.

306
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,620
Come on,

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,780
not everyone is Xiaotao.

308
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,780
Isn't that Xiaotao?

309
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,180
Hurry up.

310
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,540
This is Xiaotao.

311
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,380
Are you blind or what?

312
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,230
How is this Xiaotao?

313
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,740
This one's too petite. Can't be her.

314
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,500
It's just a drawing.

315
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,140
See? Her hair, her dress.

316
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,380
She's so pretty,

317
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,740
and she wears orchids.

318
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,620
Who else could it be?

319
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,740
Just because of the orchids?

320
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,540
Why not Chunniang? She's also from Yanzhou.

321
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Chunniang?

322
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,100
She's not that young, is she?

323
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,020
It's definitely Xiaotao.

324
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,980
And if it is, honestly,

325
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,140
I think that'd be great.

326
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,740
If Mr. Wei likes her,

327
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,140
that would save us some trouble.

328
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,660
That girl's always threatening

329
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,220
to marry one of us, you know.

330
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
That's true.

331
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,380
What's wrong, Duang?

332
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,340
Mr. Wei's looking for me?

333
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,020
Is this you?

334
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,860
What's going on?

335
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,100
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,740
I... I thought you were someone else.

337
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,100
I thought you were Xiaotao.

338
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,620
- Here you go.
- Alright.

339
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,260
Thanks.

340
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,540
When were His Lordship's clothes sent here?

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,860
Smells like alcohol and powder.

342
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,900
He must've been at Luozhong Tavern.

343
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,900
I'll go tell Her Ladyship.

344
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,860
Xiaotao.

345
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,900
No offense, General Wei Liang,

346
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,620
but it's broad daylight,
and you're skipping drill?

347
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,020
Why are you always in the inner mansion?

348
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,900
Even His Lordship doesn't come this often.

349
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm just running errands for His Lordship.

350
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,380
What errands keep you hanging
around here all the time?

351
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,500
Fine.

352
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Have you been out lately?

353
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,980
Why?

354
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,470
So you have.

355
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,660
So what if I have?

356
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,380
You men get to visit brothels
and taverns all you want,

357
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,780
but we women can't even

358
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,740
go to the market?

359
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,500
Well, going to the market is fine.

360
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,020
But if you run into an unfamiliar man,

361
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,940
you should keep your distance.

362
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,700
I may be blunt

363
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,660
and lack sweet words,

364
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,260
but all I do is for your sake.

365
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,180
You know better than any of us

366
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,020
what kind of man Mr. Wei is.

367
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,580
That man is much worse

368
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,900
than the four of us combined.

369
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,100
Lady Xu doesn't try to rein him in.

370
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,500
His Lordship turns a blind eye.

371
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,020
Don't let his sweet words

372
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,940
cloud your judgment.

373
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,700
Don't do something you'll regret.

374
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,820
Wait.

375
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,900
Even you know

376
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,740
about it now?

377
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,340
Of course I do.

378
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,180
But it's not my fault.

379
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,700
What am I supposed to do?

380
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,820
Don't talk nonsense.

381
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm looking out for you.

382
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
Take a look.

383
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,500
They're searching for you.

384
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,740
They even drew a portrait.

385
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,060
Really, everywhere.

386
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,580
If you're set on getting married,

387
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,420
just pick one of us four and be done with it.

388
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,900
Pick one of you?

389
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,020
What, are all four of you blind?

390
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,580
It's not me.

391
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,180
Not you?

392
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,260
Clearly, it's Her Ladyship.

393
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,180
Not you, huh?

394
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,060
Not you, yay.

395
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,940
You look great, Xiaotao.

396
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,940
See?

397
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,020
I told you.

398
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,340
It can't be Xiaotao.

399
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,780
No need to even ask her.

400
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,060
You idiot.

401
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,020
If it's not Xiaotao, it's worse.

402
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,740
That means Mr. Wei

403
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
likes Her Ladyship?

404
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
And you like Xiaotao, don't you?

405
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,260
Careful what you say.

406
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Let's go.

407
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,500
What?

408
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,540
Mr. Wei went to His Lordship first?

409
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,500
My Lady,

410
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,180
at such a critical time,

411
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,580
you can't stay mad at His Lordship.

412
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,740
You need to explain everything to him.

413
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,220
Mr. Wei is a rake.

414
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,660
It has nothing to do with us.

415
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,020
My Lord.

416
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,980
Please leave us.

417
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,500
Yes.

418
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,500
How's it going?

419
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
Are they fighting now?

420
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,740
Stop pretending you care.

421
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,940
You're just dying to see
that happen, aren't you?

422
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,500
Then you'll use it as an excuse

423
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,740
to kick us out of Yujun and send

424
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,580
us back to Yanzhou.

425
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,180
Don't speak nonsense.

426
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,580
You're always on about Yanzhou.

427
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
We never drove you out.

428
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,500
Wasn't it your idea?

429
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,460
That's on you, not us.

430
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,100
What's the big deal? Just head back then.

431
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,180
You're hopeless.

432
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,540
Generals,

433
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,500
please stop arguing.

434
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,020
I heard you've been

435
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,260
quite busy lately.

436
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,500
Yes,

437
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,780
a lot going on at home.

438
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,820
You and Xiaotao

439
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,340
often go to the market,

440
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,900
buying things for the birthday banquet.

441
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
It must be tiring. Thanks.

442
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,500
It's not just for Grandmother's
birthday banquet.

443
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,900
We're looking for something
that went missing.

444
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,340
What a coincidence.

445
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,020
You're looking for something,

446
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,460
and I'm searching for someone.

447
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,980
How's that going, My Lord?

448
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,740
Actually, it's going quite well for me.

449
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,460
It was delivered straight to our door.

450
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,820
Why do you have it?

451
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,420
A tavern maid
from Luozhong Tavern brought it.

452
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,540
Don't be ridiculous.

453
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,540
How could a tavern maid have my stuff?

454
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,060
I never go to such places.

455
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,060
I'm baffled too.

456
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,660
That's why I'm troubled.

457
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,020
How something from our home

458
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,260
ends up in someone else's hands so easily.

459
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,100
Even the jade bangle vanished
without a trace.

460
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,020
As Lady of the mansion,

461
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,020
I admit I have failed in my duties.

462
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,740
I accept any punishment you see fit.

463
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,900
Alright, just let it go.

464
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,700
But I truly don't know

465
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,460
how it ended up with that tavern maid.

466
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,180
I never let outsiders near me.

467
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,220
Even if the tavern maid had it,

468
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,500
perhaps it wasn't given by you.

469
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,020
Have you seen anyone recently?

470
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,180
No one in particular,

471
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,020
just my cousin...

472
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,220
Actually,

473
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,900
I did go to a tavern.

474
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,260
No tavern maids, though.

475
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,540
I've always hated such things.

476
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,260
You went to socialize.

477
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,460
That's understandable.

478
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,820
You don't need to explain.

479
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,980
Is that something

480
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,580
you intend to show me?

481
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,500
Have I ever told you that

482
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,220
you can speak frankly with me?

483
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,180
You knew perfectly well

484
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,580
why I brought the portrait today.

485
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,780
Why pretend not to know?

486
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,740
I said I'd speak frankly with you.

487
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,260
But will you listen?

488
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,780
Today, you just want to trouble me.

489
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,500
How could you listen to me in such a rage?

490
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,460
Tell me. Why did you

491
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,060
meet him at the jade artifact shop?

492
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,660
What makes you stick in his mind?

493
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,500
So,

494
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,260
who do you want to punish,

495
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,500
me or your cousin?

496
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
I...

497
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,060
You think

498
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,740
since we're cousins,

499
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,500
I only trust only his words?

500
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,260
But I'm your husband.

501
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,020
I also wish to hear your side too.

502
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,260
People have feelings.

503
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,820
Never mind.

504
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,020
Yan never

505
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,340
follows the rules,

506
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,820
but he wouldn't go so far as to offend

507
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,500
his cousin's wife.

508
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,060
When he visits Grandmother tomorrow,

509
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,900
I'll bring you to speak with him directly.

510
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,900
And honestly,

511
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
it's not your fault.

512
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
I spoke in anger just now.

513
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,220
Please don't take it to heart, My Lord.

514
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,700
Let's leave this matter behind

515
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,700
and never bring it up again.

516
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,430
You...

517
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,020
Your grandmother

518
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,820
has already prepared all sorts of pastries,

519
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,940
just waiting for you.

520
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,020
You're still reeking of alcohol.

521
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,820
Playing around is one thing,

522
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,180
but mingling with those tavern maids

523
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,980
is too much, isn't it?

524
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,580
Mother.

525
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,300
Yan.

526
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Zhonglin.

527
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,180
Where is Grandmother?

528
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,260
She's been waiting for you.

529
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,340
Now she's in the courtyard.

530
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,180
Hold on.

531
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,940
Let me introduce you.

532
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,700
This is Lady Qiao.

533
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,740
I married her

534
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,660
while you were away.

535
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,940
Mr. Wei.

536
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,540
Lady Qiao.

537
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,300
They say "the waters are too beautiful

538
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,020
thanks to the pretty duo."

539
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,220
Those words ring true.

540
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,180
Of course.

541
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,100
Forgive me.

542
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,020
I should have introduced you.

543
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,780
Let today be your official meeting.

544
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,300
From now on,

545
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,460
we are

546
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,580
one family.

547
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,020
Absolutely.

548
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,260
Aunt, what you say is fair.

549
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,260
What I lack is a good match

550
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,220
like Zhonglin's.

551
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,740
Otherwise, I wouldn't be in this state.

552
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,660
All I'm saying is,

553
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,540
since I don't have a good wife,

554
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,060
I turn to drink.

555
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,460
Alright.

556
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,100
Grandmother's waiting.

557
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,940
Go.

558
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,260
Grandmother!

559
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,060
I've come to apologize!

560
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,860
(Panyi, Wei State)

561
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,420
Welcome, General Wei.

562
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,260
You must be tired after such a long journey.

563
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,260
We've prepared a banquet

564
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,820
to honor and welcome you.

565
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,660
Please.

566
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
No need.

567
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,980
How's the Yongning Canal going?

568
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,820
Very smoothly.

569
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,700
In a few more days,

570
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,780
the work will be complete.

571
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,460
Unfortunately,

572
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,420
I heard progress is slow in Xindu.

573
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,580
The canal can only be
connected once they finish.

574
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,020
Mayor Yang, take me to see the canal first.

575
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,860
Very well.

576
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,580
General Wei, this way please.

577
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,980
(Wei Yan's Mansion, Wei State)

578
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,220
Nice shot.

579
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,300
Mr. Wei, catch!

580
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,830
- Good.
- Good.

581
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,300
Greetings, Lord Wei.

582
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,740
Zhonglin.

583
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,420
Please forgive me.

584
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,700
I was being reckless.

585
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,540
It's okay.

586
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,260
Is she the tavern maid

587
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,780
you found lately, Yan?

588
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Yes.

589
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,420
If you like her,

590
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,020
I'll let you have her.

591
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,660
Don't you think

592
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,900
she looks kind of familiar?

593
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,100
Everyone, leave us.

594
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,740
Zhonglin, I swear, you're seeing

595
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,060
every woman like she's your Lady Qiao.

596
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Yan, you've been

597
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,500
back in Yujun for a few days now.

598
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,220
All the fights before

599
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,260
were over small things.

600
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
That's my fault.

601
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,700
I should've introduced you
to Lady Qiao sooner.

602
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,260
Here, let me make it up to you.

603
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,500
Zhonglin,

604
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,660
to be honest,

605
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
I don't like your wife.

606
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,020
She just married into

607
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,740
our family and caused so much trouble.

608
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,220
Who knows what else she might do?

609
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,260
Remember, Wei State and

610
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,820
the Qiao Family have
a long history of rivalry.

611
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,260
Keep your guard up.

612
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,500
It was all a misunderstanding.

613
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,260
Before we married,

614
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
I made it clear to her

615
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,580
that she's Lady Wei now,

616
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,700
not part of the Qiao family.

617
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,420
But still,

618
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,020
the Qiaos sent her to Wei State
or a marriage alliance.

619
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,260
They also ceded Panyi.

620
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,340
There must've

621
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,300
been political gains.

622
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,580
They never make losing moves.

623
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,660
Lady Qiao is clever,

624
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,020
but she's just a woman.

625
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,460
She won't cause much trouble.

626
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,900
Besides, you don't know,

627
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,260
back in Panyi,

628
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,500
I tricked her

629
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,340
out of the seal of Panyi easily,

630
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,260
and drove her from Xindu.

631
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,180
When she came to Yujun,

632
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,020
I left her at the city gates,

633
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,260
soaked in rain for three days.

634
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,900
I was the one who gave
the final nod to this marriage

635
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,940
before it was sealed.

636
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Now, she's Lady Wei.

637
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,060
That's exactly what she wanted.

638
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,580
That's only because she helped me
with the Yongning Canal...

639
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,500
The Qiao flag flies over Boya now.

640
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,940
But I took Xiaogang soon after that.

641
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,020
It's a fair trade.

642
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,860
Yan,

643
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,740
I know you're being cautious

644
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,820
for Wei's sake.

645
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,100
However,

646
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,540
my relationship with her

647
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
is both political

648
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,780
and personal.

649
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
I know what I'm doing.

650
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,220
Now that

651
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,500
we're married,

652
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,260
I hope you'll treat her like family.

653
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,220
Please don't let Grandmother worry.

654
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,460
Of course I will.

655
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,660
Here's your painting back.

656
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,700
I couldn't find

657
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,740
the woman in it.

658
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,100
Thank you, Zhonglin.

659
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,740
- Stay for lunch.
- No, thanks.

660
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,820
I have to get back to work.

661
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,500
Next time, I'll join you for cuju.

662
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,060
You've neither eaten

663
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,740
nor played the cuju,

664
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,100
and only had a single cup of wine.

665
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,940
General,

666
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,260
both sites are complete.

667
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,940
The lower river is cleared,

668
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,810
and the upper bank

669
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,660
is filled.

670
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,420
Once the sluice opens, the Yongning Canal

671
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,580
will start flowing.

672
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Open the sluice!

673
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,580
I knew

674
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,980
there was famine in Rongjun,

675
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,220
but I didn't realize it was this bad.

676
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,500
There was little rain this year, not enough

677
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,260
to irrigate the fields.

678
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,580
Then came the dry winds.

679
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,900
The wheat withered,

680
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,460
and the harvest was cut in half.

681
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,060
Prefect has

682
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,700
run out of options,

683
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,260
so he sent me

684
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,540
to beg for help, My Lord.

685
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,460
Rongjun often suffers drought.

686
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,940
There was famine last year,

687
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,060
but His Lordship transfered grain.

688
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,660
It was costly,

689
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,260
but it worked.

690
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,320
This year,

691
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,740
aside from Yujun,

692
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,980
all of Wei State

693
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,940
had poor harvests.

694
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,580
So, there's no

695
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
surplus left to send.

696
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,740
If famine breaks out,

697
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,540
rebellion and escape will follow.

698
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,820
The region won't stay stable.

699
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,820
There are private grain hoarders.

700
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Even if it costs more,

701
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,700
we'll buy from them.

702
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,020
Prefect said

703
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,260
after three years of war,

704
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,820
private grain stores

705
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,940
are nearly gone.

706
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,260
Why are we the ones being blamed?

707
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,100
We're trying to help here.

708
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,180
We won't leave the people

709
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,260
to fend for themselves.

710
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,580
What about Hanjun?

711
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,780
I wrote to General Wei Dian

712
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,220
asking for a grain transfer.

713
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,700
He replied

714
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,220
there's no grain left.

715
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,180
Tch, Wei Dian...

716
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,940
How much longer will

717
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,900
Rongjun's grain hold out?

718
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,780
One month, at most.

719
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
One month…

720
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,340
My lord,

721
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,180
are you worried about the famine in Rongjun?

722
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,220
You do hear news quickly.

723
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,300
I learned of it when Tan delivered

724
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,460
Rongjun Prefect's gift
for Grandmother's birthday.

725
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,500
The people are suffering.

726
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,660
I can't help but worry too.

727
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,780
If there's anything troubling you,

728
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,180
please let me know.

729
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,020
I hope to ease your worries.

730
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,180
Let's eat. No politics at the table.

731
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,540
I have heard

732
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,660
Yenzhou lies in the north,

733
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,020
where people speak

734
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
loud and bold,

735
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,300
like roaring rivers.

736
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,740
While Yaozhou

737
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,020
lies in the south,

738
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,180
where people speak

739
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,260
soft and gentle,

740
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,540
like flowing streams.

741
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,740
Do you know why that is, My Lord?

742
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,500
As it turns out,

743
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
the way people speak

744
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,740
is linked to

745
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,180
local diets.

746
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,940
Indeed, people are shaped by the land.

747
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,940
Or rather, by the crops

748
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,260
it gives them.

749
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,500
You're right, My Lord.

750
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,540
I've heard Wei grows spring wheat.

751
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,260
It's drought-resistant,

752
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,300
just like the people of Wei State,

753
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,020
tough and resilient.

754
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,220
But though hardy,

755
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,660
spring wheat has low yields.

756
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,020
In harsh drought,

757
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,500
it may fail altogether.

758
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,540
That's true.

759
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,740
Rongjun suffers just such a fate.

760
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,660
So, what will you do now?

761
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,980
Try to borrow grain

762
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,180
from other regions

763
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,500
to help them pull through.

764
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,580
But that's only a temporary measure,

765
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,460
not a lasting solution.

766
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,060
The famine in Rongjun caused by drought.

767
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
If you truly seek a lasting remedy,

768
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,020
shouldn't the Yongning Canal

769
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,780
be extended south

770
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,780
into Rongjun?

771
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,100
With proper irrigation,

772
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,940
famine would never return.

773
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,540
Sounds like you're not

774
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,220
trying to fix the problem,

775
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,420
but diverting the trouble.

776
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,900
What are you talking about?

777
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,820
I don't understand.

778
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,300
No, you understand perfectly.

779
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,660
Canal construction
takes huge effort and cost.

780
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,220
Xindu is far from Rongjun.

781
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,140
If I focus on the canal,

782
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,580
I won't have energy

783
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,860
to attack Yanzhou.

784
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,980
Besides, Rongjun borders Bianzhou.

785
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,020
If I finish this canal, my threat

786
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,460
to Bianzhou will be
even bigger than to Yanzhou.

787
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,980
Isn't that exactly what you want?

788
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,020
I didn't think that far ahead.

789
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,860
You must've

790
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,100
thought much farther than me.

791
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,340
You're right.

792
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,180
That is exactly what I was thinking.

793
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,940
Sure, I considered

794
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,340
Yanzhou's interests

795
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,220
when I suggested building the canal.

796
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
Canal construction takes Wei effort and time,

797
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,020
but it brings Yanzhou some peace.

798
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,140
That much is true.

799
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,980
But if the canal reaches Rongjun,

800
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,900
it helps countless people in Wei.

801
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,100
That's also true.

802
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,220
If the canal is finished,

803
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,700
Yanzhou might get

804
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,180
a few years of peace,

805
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,300
but Wei benefits in the long run.

806
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,540
You're pretty open about your plans.

807
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,900
But I'll decide what to do.

808
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,900
You don't need to bring it up again.

809
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,980
Have your dinner.

810
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,380
Mr. Wei.

811
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,820
Is Zhonglin in there?

812
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,140
Mr. Wei, His Lordship

813
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,540
works at the Government Office,

814
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,420
not in the study.

815
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,020
Alright, I'll wait for him inside.

816
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,220
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

817
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,020
Why not?

818
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,540
What's he hiding in there? Some beauties?

819
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,420
Yan.

820
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,820
Tan, how are you doing your job,

821
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,100
letting an outsider into Zhonglin's study?

822
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,300
It's not his fault.

823
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,220
His Lordship said before,

824
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,500
if I need any records

825
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,340
or books,

826
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,020
I may come anytime

827
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,580
without asking him.

828
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,380
(Local Records of Rongjun)

829
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
Local Records of Rongjun?

830
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,500
You're a Qiao, but you always

831
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,980
poking around in our Wei affairs.

832
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,740
Though I'm from the Qiao family,

833
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,180
I still have the right to read.

834
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,300
Can you swear

835
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,860
you married Zhonglin

836
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,500
without any hidden motives?

837
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,900
That you're not using him?

838
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,620
That's between me and His Lordship.

839
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,500
You don't need to worry about that.

840
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,740
Besides,

841
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,690
His...

842
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,860
Don't forget,

843
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,060
the Wei and Qiao families are old foes.

844
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,980
To the Wei family,
you'll never truly be one of them.

845
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,140
I'll take my leave.

846
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,460
(Rongjun sits at the valley's end.)
Rongjun is in drought.

847
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,860
Quickly send this letter to Uncle.

848
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,380
Yes.

849
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,900
(Wei Mansion)

850
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,940
Is this true?

851
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,940
I met the man during my travels.

852
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,620
His family always keeps grain stored.

853
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,140
He agreed to sell it to us

854
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,300
but at twice the market price.

855
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,980
Though it won't

856
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,580
end the famine in Rongjun,

857
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,500
at least,

858
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,940
it can ease the burden for now.

859
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,020
Thank you, Yan.

860
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,980
I'll have

861
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,220
Wei Liang make arrangements.

862
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,460
Zhonglin,

863
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,980
there's one thing I'm unsure

864
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,060
if I should tell you.

865
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Please go ahead.

866
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,860
Yesterday, I went to your study.

867
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,780
I saw your wife coming and going freely.

868
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
She even took

869
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,940
bamboo slips.

870
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,660
I know you two

871
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,580
are close, and that's good.

872
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,540
But she's still from the Qiao family.

873
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,460
The study is sensitive and you've

874
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,580
left it unguarded?

875
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,820
I already gave

876
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,020
her permission to enter freely.

877
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,140
No reason to take it back.

878
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
Besides, there's no

879
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
important bamboo slips in my study.

880
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,380
It's fine.

881
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,660
I asked Tan.

882
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,980
He said

883
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,940
Lady Qiao took

884
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,580
Local Records of Rongjun.

885
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Do you know

886
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
she sent an urgent letter

887
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,780
to Yanzhou

888
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,180
this morning?

889
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,340
Yan, don't worry.

890
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,500
Lady Qiao is truly kind-hearted.

891
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,020
You're the one to talk, huh?

892
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,820
It's so suspicious,
and you won't look into it.

893
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,500
You really can relax.

894
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,660
Actually,

895
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,220
I read that letter word for word.

896
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,940
It was only a record of

897
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,540
Rongjun's geography,

898
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,580
weather,

899
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,020
and preferred crops.

900
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,510
She wasn't leaking secrets.

901
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,220
She was requesting

902
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,020
wheat seeds from Yanzhou.

903
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,500
Wheat seeds?

904
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,780
Lady Qiao truly cares for the people.

905
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,100
Once the canal is finished, she hopes

906
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,380
Rongjun can grow Yanzhou's winter wheat.

907
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,500
If the soil fits,

908
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,580
yields could

909
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,460
far exceed local spring wheat.

910
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,620
That way, the drought could be

911
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,380
ended for good.

912
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,460
I...

913
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,660
I thought

914
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,540
you fully trusted Lady Qiao.

915
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,620
I didn't expect

916
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,540
you'd even read her letters.

917
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,100
As the ruler of Wei State,

918
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,820
how could I fully trust anyone?

919
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,820
I keep my guard up, always.

920
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,860
So,

921
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,540
I've been worrying too much.

922
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,700
Each supply cart

923
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,540
need to travel for 14 days.

924
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,860
We need to deliver 500 dan of grain

925
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,420
and 700 dan of black beans.

926
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,820
So, each supply cart

927
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,100
carries 12 dan of grain

928
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,940
and...

929
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,500
18 dan of black beans.

930
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,420
We need 10 men and 7 horses.

931
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,900
So, I'll need 3 of...

932
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,980
Who's laughing at me over there?

933
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,780
Xiaotao?

934
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,620
Duang,

935
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
counting on your fingers, huh?

936
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,900
Got enough fingers for that?

937
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,460
Xiaotao, I'm gladly you're here.

938
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,140
You're good at numbers. Help me out.

939
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,060
What is it?

940
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,100
Right now, I need 10 men

941
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,220
and 7 horses.

942
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,820
10 men and 7 horses, and then?

943
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,140
(His Lordship warned us)

944
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,940
(to be cautious of the Qiao family.)

945
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,460
(Grain transport is military intelligence.)

946
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,780
(I can't tell Xiaotao truth.)

947
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,020
Actually, it's

948
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,540
10 monkeys

949
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,500
7 pigs

950
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,820
pulling one cart.

951
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,340
Each cart carries

952
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,300
12 dan of dirt and 18 dan of wood.

953
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Altogether, we need to deliver

954
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,780
500 dan of dirt and 800...

955
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,100
I mean 700 dan of wood.

956
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,620
So how many monkeys,

957
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,020
pigs, and carts

958
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020
do I need?

959
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,140
Right, and

960
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,340
the trip takes 14 days.

961
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,020
Each day,

962
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,420
monkeys need 2 sheng of food,

963
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,540
pigs need 3.

964
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,100
What do monkeys eat? And pigs?

965
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,900
Monkeys eat dirt.

966
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,100
Pigs... pigs eat wood.

967
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,020
Lend me a hand.

968
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,700
You need to deliver 500 dan of dirt,

969
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,560
and 700 dan of wood.

970
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,140
So, you'll need 400 men, 300 horses,

971
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,180
and 40 carts.

972
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,100
400 men, 300 horses...

973
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,980
Based on Wei's daily military ration,

974
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,980
each man eats 2 sheng of rice,

975
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,500
a horse eats 3 sheng of beans.

976
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,540
In 14 days,

977
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,940
you'll need 112 dan of rice

978
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,060
and 126 dan of beans.

979
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,460
Since each supply soldier
carries 3 days' rations,

980
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,940
you'll arrive with

981
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,660
412 dan of rice

982
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,020
and 574 dan of beans left.

983
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,820
That's enough

984
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,900
to feed 10,000 men
and horses for about 3 days.

985
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,020
But Rongjun has fewer than 10,000 people.

986
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,860
If made into porridge and given out,

987
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,140
it could last even longer,

988
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,460
enough for His Lordship to find another way.

989
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,140
What? Rongjun?

990
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,460
When did I ever say Rongjun?

991
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,460
I said moneys

992
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,300
and pigs.

993
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,900
How did you know?

994
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,420
As far as I know,

995
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,380
a supply unit moves 30 li per day.

996
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,420
With weight loss,

997
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,780
it'll move 390 to 400 li

998
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,620
in 14 days.

999
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,820
At that distance from Yujun,

1000
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,100
only famine-struck Rongjun fits.

1001
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,540
Do your job well.

1002
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,780
You owe me one now.

1003
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,380
So, His Lordship gathered these supplies

1004
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,060
to support Rongjun.

1005
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,500
Paste them carefully.

1006
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,620
Yes.

1007
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,940
(Heaven blesses you; all shall thrive.)

1008
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,980
My Lady, please have some tea.

1009
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,820
Xiang.

1010
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,620
Make those flowers look better.

1011
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,540
Yes.

1012
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,100
(Celebrate your birthday.)

1013
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
Xiaozao,

1014
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,540
go fetch some ink sticks,

1015
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,860
or the writing color will be uneven.

1016
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,340
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Wei.

1017
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:06,500
Mr. Wei.

1018
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,980
Your calligraphy is elegant and refined,

1019
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,620
just like your character.

1020
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,380
Even the ink smells fragrant.

1021
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,660
It suits you

1022
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,980
perfectly.

1023
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,220
You flatter me, Yan.

1024
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,460
With Grandmother's
birthday banquet approaching,

1025
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,580
I'm just making

1026
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
some simple preparations.

1027
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,140
I didn't mean to show
my poor skills before you.

1028
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,020
I've run out of ink sticks.

1029
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,300
I'll go fetch some.
