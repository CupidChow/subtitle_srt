33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,820
I'll go pack our things now.

No.

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,180
Our greater plan isn't complete.

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,180
I must not go back.

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,210
That old perp.

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,580
His death was well-deserved.

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,090
My Lord,

44
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,020
I'll dig up that Qiao rebel

45
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,180
and flog his corpse!

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,370
He died too easy!

47
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,970
We never got to see him fall
when we took Yanzhou.

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Generals,

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,300
don't dwell on hatred.

50
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,930
See the bigger picture
to act flexibly.

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,690
Then, Mr. Gongsun, tell us,

52
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,810
why would they send an obituary now?

53
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,930
The marriage will be canceled

54
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,060
due to filial mourning.

55

Our claims to Panyi

56
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,620
and the canal project

57
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,930
would both be delayed!

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,900
What schemes are the Qiaos plotting now?

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,370

61

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,300
It's alright.

64
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,530

66
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,210
this marriage would never happen.

67
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,580
But I only have one question:

68
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,820
Will you marry me or not?

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,290

70
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,620

72
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,940
don't know our plans.

This marriage

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,700

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,580
(Spirit Tablet of the Late Lord Qiao Gui)

190
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,330
Are you cold, My Lady?

191
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,810
I'll fetch hot water.

192
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,820
Mother, take this.

193
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,700
- But you need it.
- I'm fine.

194
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,220
Xiaotao, hold the umbrella.

195
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,530
Oh, this child...

196
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,650
My Lady,

197
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,050
we're traveling overnight,

198
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,290
and since you're not healed,

199
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,050
it might slow your recovery.

200
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,250
The soldiers have been away so long.

201
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,570
It's reasonable
that they're eager to return.

202
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,460
We'll rest properly

203
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,530
once we reach Yujun.

204
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,050
We don't yet know

205
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,700
what awaits us in Yujun.

206
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,850
Let's get in now.

207
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,740
This journey has been full of

208
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
snakes and earthworms,

209
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,610
a sign of heavy rain within two days.

210
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,290
The road ahead is marshy.

211
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,370
Traveling after rainfall

212
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,740
would be far too dangerous.

213
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,500
Our siege on Panyi

214
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,610
has delayed us by days.

215
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,050
With any further delays,

216
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,020
I'll miss the memorial rites for my family.

217
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,880
Alright.

218
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,940
I'll give the orders.

219
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,370
My Lord,

220
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,740
traveling overnight

221
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,850
is no problem for us,

222
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,090
but Mrs. Wei is injured.

223
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,500
Should we press on,

224
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,610
or wait for her?

225
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,980
Keep moving.

226
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,780
Soldiers, prepare to depart!

227
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,780
Yes!

228
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,530
What now?

229
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,130
Hold this.

230
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,780
Thank you, General Wei.

231
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,780
Hold on.

232
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,740
I saved your life back in Panyi,

233
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,390
and this is your attitude?

234
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,020
What's wrong with it?

235
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,810
Lord of Wei already told
Mrs. Wei they're even.

236
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,810
Yet you act like

237
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,050
I still owe you something.

238
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,700
They have made peace.

239
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,460
You're the only one

240
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,300
still snapping at me.

241
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
Am I?

242
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,210
No.

243
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,820
Wait.

244
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,660
My Lord ordered us

245
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,530
to keep traveling.

246
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Fetching water wastes time.

247
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,090
Are you serious?

248
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,290
It's freezing. We just wanted hot water.

249
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,660
The memorial rites

250
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,020
for Lord Wei's grandfather,

251
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,570
father, and brother are in a few days.

252
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,090
Would delaying the trip

253
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,130
for your water

254
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,020
be appropriate?

255
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,090
How long could fetching water take?

256
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,930
Too long.

257
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,050
- Picking a fight?
- Tao.

258
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,930
Let's set off.

259
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:26,930
Alright.

260
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,890
Do you hear that?

261
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,300
No water.

262
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,100
(Yujun, Wei State)

263
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,220
Lord of Wei is back!

264
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,330
Lord of Wei is back!

265
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,500
Lord of Wei is back!

266
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,890
Lord of Wei is back!

267
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,780
Lord of Wei is back!

268
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,980
(Wei)
Lord of Wei is back!

269
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,130
Lord of Wei is back!

270
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,370
Shao.

271
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,410
Chuyu.

272
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,420
For the past half month,

273
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,380
(Zheng Chuyu, Wei Shao's cousin)
I've waited here

274
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,090
for you every day.

275
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,980
I'm glad you're back.

276
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,660
Have all the clan members arrived?

277
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,090
All the uncles

278
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,740
and the regional prefects are here,

279
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,290
except General Wei Dian.

280
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,370
He's still on the road.

281
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,330
We made it all the way from Panyi.

282
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,610
Couldn't he make it from Hanjun?

283
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,940
He's doing this on purpose.

284
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,330
Wasn't Lady Qiao

285
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,260
supposed to enter the city with you?

286
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,890
I left her outside the city.

287
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,090
But after the memorial rites,

288
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,330
I'll trouble you

289
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,460
to bring her in.

290
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,490
Wei Liang, Wei Xiao, Wei Qu, Wei Duo,

291
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,350
you stay behind.

292
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,460
The rest, follow me.

293
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,350
Yes.

294
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,810
Thank you, Generals.

295
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,530
(Yujun)
Why am I stuck here?

296
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,220
Couldn't you three stay instead?

297
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,330
Quit your whining.

298
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,530
Why can't it be you?

299
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,450
Let's draw lots.

300
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,330
No,

301
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,090
I never win at that.

302
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,740
Your own bad luck, who else to blame?

303
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,570
How dare they leave us

304
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,500
in this desolate area outside the city?

305
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,810
I thought he'd treat My Lady better

306
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,700
once we arrive in Yujun.

307
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,660
He didn't mean to

308
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,500
shame us.

309
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,940
But the memorial rites
are for three generations.

310
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,810
Our presence would be improper.

311
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,260
We should remain outside.

312
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,140
(Lady Zhu, Wei Shao's mother)

313
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,780
(Spirit Tablet of the Late Lord Wei Lun)

314
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,620
(Ancestral Virtues Endure)

315
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,020
You're not even fully grown yet.

316
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,220
How can you claim the clan leadership?

317
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,980
You're shorter than the seat itself.

318
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,500
What, you gonna climb onto it?

319
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,220
If a child ascends to leadership,

320
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,460
I fear...

321
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,220
(Wei Dian, Prefect of Hanjun)

322
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,530
A boy who cries at the sight of blood.

323
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,810
How will he

324
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,570
lead armies in the future?

325
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,940
When will Wei's blood feud be avenged?

326
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,530
Exactly! This child cries at blood.

327
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,180
How will he ever take revenge?

328
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,610
- My son...
- Indeed.

329
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,940
What can he possibly achieve?

330
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,500
When will our vengeance be settled?

331
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,180
Lady Xu has arrived.

332
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,370
Have you all had enough?

333
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,370
Greetings, Lady Xu.

334
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,610
Wei Shao,

335
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,660
though not yet of age,

336
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,890
shall inherit

337
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,500
the clan leadership anyway.

338
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,850
This...

339
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,810
I

340
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,740
pay my respects, My Lord.

341
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,630
I pay my respects, My Lord.

342
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,940
I, Zhonglin,

343
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,530
swear to heaven,

344
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,020
I'll kill Li Su

345
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,890
and the Qiao Clan!

346
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:52,050
Kill Li Su and the Qiao Clan!

347
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,780
Rise.

348
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,130
Husband,

349
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,940
Bogong,

350
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,530
why did you both leave me

351
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,460
so soon?

352
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,050
All these years,

353
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,330
I've thought of nothing else

354
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,850
but avenging you.

355
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,810
One day,

356
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,500
when I've taken revenge,

357
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,290
I'll join you underground

358
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:18,020
so we can reunite.

359
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,500
But today,

360
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,420
Zhonglin

361
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,780
is marrying our enemy's daughter.

362
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,520
How can I ever face you

363
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,180
with dignity now?

364
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,250
I authorized their marriage.

365
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,780
Zhonglin isn't to blame.

366
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,290
A marriage is one thing,

367
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,420
but Zhonglin,

368
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,290
you didn't execute that Qiao traitor!

369
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,020
You let him die of old age...

370
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,940
Someone

371
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,890
escort Lady Zhu to rest

372
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,460
before grief overwhelms her.

373
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,810
Hold on!

374
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,090
Lady Zhu speaks the truth.

375
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,220
Lady Xu,

376
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,570
why silence her now?

377
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,860
Uncle,

378
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,180
you're late again.

379
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,500
Hanjun affairs kept me occupied.

380
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,610
That's why I was delayed.

381
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,850
Surely the late Lord Wei's spirit

382
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,330
wouldn't hold it against me.

383
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,130
Yet you...

384
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,980
married our enemy's daughter.

385
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,370
How could his spirit

386
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,700
rest peacefully?

387
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,620
Don't forget

388
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,570
who once shouted

389
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,220
"kill Li Su and the Qiao Clan!"

390
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,210
General,

391
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,530
our lord has retaken Xindu

392
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,570
and slain Li Su.

393
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,460
What of it?

394
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,890
The Qiaos' betrayal

395
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,530
was worse than Li Su's crimes.

396
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,090
You were in Xindu back then.

397
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,420
You saw the massacre yourself.

398
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,180
Yet now

399
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,530
you welcome a Qiao into our home.

400
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,850
How can the late lord

401
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,180
rest in peace?

402
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,500
Indeed.

403
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,090
Look around you,

404
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,690
who here hasn't lost

405
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,500
a father, brother, or son?

406
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,660
The Wei Clan

407
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,180
and the Qiao Clan
have always been sworn enemies.

408
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,980
Yet you...

409
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,530
you married a Qiao woman.

410
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,260
Fine.

411
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,850
Let's see how you explain this
to our ancestors!

412
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,890
Exactly.

413
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,850
Mr. Gongsun.

414
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,690
Here.

415
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,780
What is this?

416
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,980
The seal of Panyi.

417
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,610
Panyi is a gateway to Yanzhou.

418
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,330
By marrying Lady Qiao,

419
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,850
we took Panyi

420
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,660
without a single battle.

421
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,570
From now on,

422
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,370
Yanzhou's gates lie open.

423
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,180
Capturing Kangjun

424
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,050
will be as easy

425
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,780
as reaching into a bag.

426
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,940
Pretty words.

427
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,530
If you've taken Panyi,

428
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,290
why not press the advantage

429
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,500
and seize Kangjun now?

430
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,850
Uncle, if you must ask,

431
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,420
then I have a question for you.

432
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,420
As the Prefect of Hanjun,

433
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,850
after I took Xindu,

434
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,890
I sent urgent dispatches

435
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,330
demanding reinforcements.

436
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,500
Yet I waited for days,

437
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,220
why did no aid

438
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,940
arrive?

439
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,370
You can't just accuse me.

440
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,610
Everyone, I never received
a single letter.

441
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,810
Otherwise, I would've sent help.

442
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,690
Good.

443
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,780
I will get to the truth of this.

444
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,130
I marched my troops

445
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,740
only to fulfill Grandfather's wish

446
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,290
to restore the Yongning Canal

447
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,220
and benefit the people.

448
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,980
I've never forgotten the feud
between two families.

449
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180
But if I could wait fourteen years,

450
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,980
I can surely

451
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,290
wait ten more.

452
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,060
(Yujun)

453
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,260
This is outrageous,

454
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
making us wait here in the pouring rain.

455
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,370
They barred My Lady from entering,

456
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,130
not your maids.

457
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,570
I'll confront them.

458
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,850
Don't be rash.

459
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,780
Are we just supposed

460
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,370
to wait here forever?

461
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,420
When has my lady
ever endured such humiliation?

462
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,130
Since the Lord of Wei hasn't come,

463
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,370
matters must still be unsettled.

464
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,610
With clan relations still fragile,

465
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,090
we must bear this slight.

466
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,570
We knew marriage here

467
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,370
would be difficult,

468
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,980
just not this difficult.

469
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,130
This won't do.

470
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Zao,

471
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,460
let's hang the rain tarp.

472
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,130
Go ahead.

473
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,180
Take umbrellas.

474
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,370
Pull harder!

475
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,610
Lower it.

476
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,450
Lower.

477
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,050
Let me help. Come on.

478
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,090
Harder.

479
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,660
Come on.

480
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,180
Zao, assist him.

481
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,260
He can't manage alone.

482
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,330
Use what you have!

483
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:50,690
Come on.

484
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,180
One, two...

485
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,180
Pull!

486
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,850
Don't let go!

487
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,660
One, two, three!

488
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,980
This way! Over here!

489
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,090
Duo,

490
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,610
fetch the brazier.

491
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,850
- Draw straws.
- Hurry!

492
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,690
There.

493
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,810
That's enough.

494
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,130
Quick! Secure that nail tighter.

495
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,330
That side,

496
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,330
move it over.

497
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,940

from Xindu?

533
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,930
We'd have been better off in Panyi,

534
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
at least closer to Kangjun.

535
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,060
It's getting hotter.

536
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,810
What do we do?

537
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,100
Our luggage is soaked,
no dry covers left...

538
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,370
You go that way.

539
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,410
You two, come with me.

540
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

541
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,260
Are you here to escort us into the city?

542
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,140
We've been ordered to take you to Yanzhou.

543
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,330
Yanzhou?

544
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,170
Yes.

545
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,410
Nonsense!

546
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,850
By whose orders?

547
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,490
Mrs. Wei married Lord of Wei.

548
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,930
She's the Lady of Wei.

549
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,330
Not anymore.

550
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,660
(Letter of Divorce)
Faster!

551
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,010
Letter of Divorce?

552
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,470
- Don't move!
- Get down!

553
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,410
- Down, now!
- What are you doing?

554
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,290
On your knees!

555
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,450
- What for?
- Stay down!

556
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,330
Kneel!

557
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,140
Since the Lord married Mrs. Wei in Panyi,

558
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,810
he wouldn't banish her now.

559
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,740
There's something fishy.

560
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,140
Enough nonsense! Get down!

561
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,330
What are you doing?

562
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,220
Don't touch our belongings!

563
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,260
You guard the carriage.

564
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,780
Wei Liang, enter the city at once

565
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,850
and seek confirmation.

566
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,010
- Get down!
- What's going on?

567
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,940
My Lord,

568
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,080
General Wei Liang requests an audience

569
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,810
outside the city.

570
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,140
Why is Wei Liang outside?

571
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,180
Have you forgotten?

572
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,220
(Tan, attendant)
He's been outside these days,

573
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,060
tending to Mrs. Wei.

574
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,330
With the recent storms,

575
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,100
Mrs. Wei has been ill for some time.

576
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,850
The rites concluded two days ago.

577
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,490
Why wasn't she summoned inside?

578
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,010
I don't know.

579
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
Shao.

580
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,370
I have urgent matters to report.

581
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,140
The situation is grave and sudden.

582
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,700
Forgive my abruptness.

583
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,450
I beg your pardon.

584
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,580
Speak.

585
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,940
Days ago,

586
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,540
you ordered me

587
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,890
to escort Lady Qiao into the city.

588
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,700
All was prepared,

589
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,930
but Aunt had other plans.

590
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,930
Aunt acts out of motherly love.

591
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,580
Everything she does is for your sake.

592
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,290
So, I followed her instructions.

593
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,890
But afterward,

594
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,100
I feared

595
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,850
this might not align with your wishes.

596
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,180
So I came to tell you,

597
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,540
for my own peace of mind.

598
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,890
What are you trying to say?

599
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,970
My aunt

600
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,890
feared Lady Qiao would bewitch

601
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,370
and endanger you.

602
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,810
So she sent someone

603
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,180
to deliver the Letter of Divorce.

604
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,890
- What?
- I beg you, Shao,

605
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,330
don't blame Aunt.

606
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,170
This is madness!

607
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,020
(Yujun)

608
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:02,810
What are you doing?

609
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,890
- Stop!
- Move aside!

610
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,010
Why?

611
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,370
Don't pull it out!

612
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,740
Step back!

613
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,660
No, don't pull it out!

614
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,900
- Leave them!
- Get away!

615
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,890
My Lady...

616
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,810
Speak to me, please.

617
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,620
General,

618
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,930
please.

619
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,740
Mrs. Wei is ill.

620
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,010
General...

621
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,010
- General, you...
- Go away!

622
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,490
Hurry!

623
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,350
Pull harder!

624
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,490
My Lady.

625
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,180
Generals,

626
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,220
I beg you,

627
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,100
please ask Lord of Wei again.

628
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,450
There must be some mistake.

629
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,580
He wouldn't cast her out like this.

630
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,740
I implore you.

631
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,060
Stop this, please get up.

632
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,060
I'm begging you.

633
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,460
Enough. Enough.

634
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,260
You always scowled at us.

635
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,540
Why act like this now?

636
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,890
Wei Liang went to inform the Lord.

637
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,100
No response yet.

638
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,700
The Lord's mind seems set.

639
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,490
Before...

640
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,450
Before, it was all my fault.

641
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,930
Punish me however you want,

642
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,140
but Mrs. Wei has never harmed you.

643
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,140
She was already injured,

644
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,140
and now she's burning with fever.

645
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,660
If she's jostled on the road back,

646
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,180
she'll die.

647
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,060
I beg you.

648
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,410
Back in Panyi,

649
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,850
she burned her own arm

650
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,290
just to help you all,

651
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,930
and it's still not healed.

652
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,540
How can you be so heartless?

653
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,850
Even if the Lord is determined
to cast her out,

654
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,540
he can't take her life.

655
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,740
- Hurry.
- Move the carriage.

656
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,970
Move, now.

657
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,970
No!

658
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,450
No, stop!

659
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,450
Step back!

660
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,260
Quick, push it through.

661
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,970
Don't be afraid.

662
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,970
Stop pushing. They can't leave.

663
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,890
What do we do?

664
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,200
At worst, military rod.

665
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,740
For something this serious,

666
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,290
- it'll be forty at least.
- But...

667
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,370
- Don't! Stop pushing!
- Go away!

668
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,740
Don't be afraid.

669
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm here.

670
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,740
Stop! It's not allowed!

671
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,410
Get lost!

672
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,930
Block the carriage first!

673
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,310
Hya!

674
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,100
Hya!

675
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,980
Hya!

676
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,330
My Lord.

677
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
Who sent you here?

678
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,700
It... it was Lady Zhu.

679
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,420
- Get out!
- Yes, My Lord.

680
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,890
My Lord.

681
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,290
Mrs. Wei is burning with fever.

682
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,580
Please save her.

683
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,370
