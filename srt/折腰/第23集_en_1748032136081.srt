Episode 31

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're always searching for me.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Isn't this a natural phenomenon?

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
Thefield?

9
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
The field is controlling mountains and countryside at out Butler City.

10
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Until then...

11
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Five miles away,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,480
is our

13
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,000
eldest daughter.

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Jin Yan?

15
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Think it over carefully!

16
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,400
we're definitely not being 추 pierws h gardenキ

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:27,300
won't be 추

18
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,940
추

19
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,820
추

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,280
The time between the eyes

21
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
Passed through the memories

22
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Unwilling to wake up

23
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,600
Love without regret

24
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,040
This love is hard to chase

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,280
Cross the river

26
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Just to be together

27
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,480
The white rain

28
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,600
Falling in the palm of my hand

29
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,640
Love is like snow melting in the wind

30
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Mom

31
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,080
Is there someone out looking for play aqua

32
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm sorry.

33
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,520
Did Nan Jun bring me back yesterday?

34
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes.

35
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,760
You were drunk yesterday.

36
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,600
Did I say anything

37
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,800
to upset Nan Jun when I was drunk?

38
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
No.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,960
Who did this?

40
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
It's not my fault.

41
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
Don't drink anymore.

42
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
I was drunk before.

43
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm not annoying.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Boss, let's go.

45
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,240
Let's go.

46
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,920
Master, what's wrong with your neck?

47
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,600
Are you okay?

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
It's a cat's head.

49
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Master, when did you get a cat?

50
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
You're so silly.

51
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,160
What's wrong?

52
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,560
Well.

53
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Nan Jun.

54
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,240
What's up?

55
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,600
Well, when I was in Rong Jun,

56
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,600
Wei Liang gave me a small gold watch.

57
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Did you lose it?

58
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
No.

59
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
How could I lose it?

60
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,640
Well, I want to give it back to him.

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Last time I asked him

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,760
why Nan Jun was angry,

63
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,880
he said yes.

64
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Go back.

65
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Why are you here?

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,720
Well.

67
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,560
I want to give him this.

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
A red hearted mirror.

69
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Isn't it practical?

70
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,960
But it's just a normal bronze mirror.

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
I want to give him a better one.

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,840
I don't have much knowledge.

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,760
Please help me make up my mind.

74
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,160
Give it to me.

75
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,120
Thank you.

76
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,320
Nan Jun.

77
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,320
Where's Li Jun?

78
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Li Jun went out to buy something.

79
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,040
He went to the west market.

80
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,800
He'll be back soon.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
Okay, I see.

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes.

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,440
Get on.

84
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
You're back so early today.

85
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,920
Yes.

86
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,920
What did you do today?

87
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,000
I went shopping.

88
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you have dinner?

89
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,800
Not yet.

90
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,680
Go and prepare dinner.

91
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,360
Yes.

92
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,600
I'll go change.

93
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay.

94
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:17,720
Cater

95
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,920
Are you free today?

96
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
I'm fine.

97
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
Even if it's for my own good,

98
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
you should take care of yourself.

99
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,880
Are you talking about

100
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,560
the Luli Conference?

101
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't worry, Nan Jun.

102
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,040
I've basically

103
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,720
figured out the situation.

104
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,280
You don't have to worry about it.

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
I just want to

106
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
tell you something.

107
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

108
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,080
So I want to ask you

109
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,520
to invite them to represent Yanzhou.

110
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
Sure. It's not a big deal.

111
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,880
By the way,

112
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,520
don't invite them to the event in Bianzhou.

113
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,260
After all, the

114
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,560
event is not related to Bianzhou.

115
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,120
I understand.

116
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Do you have anything to tell me?

117
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,680
Or do you have anything to do?

118
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,040
Write a letter.

119
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
Then write it.

120
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,960
Okay.

121
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,280
I'll go check on the food.

122
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm hungry.

123
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,080
I'll go.

124
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
I'll go.

125
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,720
I'll go.

126
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,560
Mingxuan.

127
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
Did you forget something?

128
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,720
Okay.

129
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay.

130
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,840
Now Nan Jun

131
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,680
doesn't have to worry about

132
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
the destruction at night.

133
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Thank you.

134
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,160
Wait.

135
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,320
You don't have anything else to do?

136
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,400
No.

137
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
Then go to bed early.

138
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,560
Your uncle is fine.

139
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,880
Your father worries about you the most.

140
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Go back early

141
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,680
and tell him you're safe.

142
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,440
When will your aunt go back?

143
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,600
Your elder sister and brother-in-law

144
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,000
are going to Yujin to attend the Luli Conference.

145
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
I'll accompany them.

146
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,360
I happen to see your sister

147
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,400
and your father.

148
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll go with them.

149
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
I'll go with them.

150
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,800
I'll go with them.

151
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll go with them.

152
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,120
I'll go with them.

153
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,360
I'd think about the障 fired

154
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,480
your elder sister.

155
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,040
The Luli Conference is

156
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,200
about the result stroke advice?

157
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
I only heard it before,

158
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,040
never seen it before.

159
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Don't be greedy.

160
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,840
We have things to attend.

161
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
It's really inconvenient for us to lead you around.

162
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,400
Ze,

163
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,080
I have asked them to take you back to the city.

164
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,480
Remain in peace.

165
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,600
Mingxuan,

166
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,880
I want one more thing.

167
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,040
With it,

168
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
I won't regret anything.

169
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
Just say it.

170
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,400
I'll follow your order.

171
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,840
I want a horse that can travel thousands of miles a day.

172
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,920
A horse that can be ridden by others.

173
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,240
That's easy to say.

174
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,000
No problem.

175
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Thank you, brother-in-law.

176
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
The basic procedure of the Luli Conference has been decided.

177
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,720
The first day,

178
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,920
we'll have a competition.

179
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,000
The second day,

180
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
we'll hunt.

181
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
The evening meeting will be held in the night scene.

182
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,920
We'll have a competition to see who can win.

183
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,600
Yes.

184
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Although this time,

185
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,240
we're doing this to show our power,

186
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,400
we still need to take care of ourselves

187
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,760
during the competition.

188
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
At this time,

189
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,440
the protective mirror is very important.

190
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,960
It can save our lives at critical moments.

191
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Of course.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,200
Speaking of which, I suddenly remember

193
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
that the female army made me a special protective mirror.

194
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,120
It's thicker than usual.

195
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
And there are gold and silver around it.

196
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,720
It's a great blessing.

197
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,800
Master,

198
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
is this what you're talking about?

199
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Why are you here?

200
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,560
No.

201
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,520
Xiao Tao gave it to me this morning.

202
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,080
No, it must be Xiao Tao who gave it to the wrong person.

203
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,200
Take it.

204
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,720
I remembered it wrong.

205
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,040
Mine is

206
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,040
white jade-like.

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,520
It's gold-like.

208
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,560
And there are two round-shaped ones on it.

209
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,640
It's about the size of a couple of gold bars.

210
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,200
It must be different from the one the female army gave.

211
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Of course.

212
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,280
Let's go.

213
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
The Love by Hypnotic

214
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,440
Don't play around on the road.

215
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,680
Go home early.

216
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,640
Xiao Tao.

217
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,920
Let's stop here.

218
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,120
Don't walk us out.

219
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,120
Bye.

220
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,360
Be careful.

221
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,040
See you.

222
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,560
Go.

223
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,280
Bye.

224
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,080
Have you discussed with Mr. Gongsun

225
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
about the list?

226
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,960
Is there anything else to add?

227
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,640
No.

228
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,920
Just make sure.

229
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,860
Okay.

230
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,800
You said

231
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,260
that your sister would be invited

232
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,320
to do the drawing activity.

233
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,720
Yes.

234
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,520
She and she must be well related.

235
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,320
We're well related.

236
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,520
She's a master of painter.

237
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,940
I assume he also does that.

238
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

239
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,400
Since she's so good at war достиvers,

240
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,040
Of course.

241
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,080
Will you sew her a jacket

242
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,640
or something else?

243
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,120
I guess I'll sew her a shoe.

244
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,880
No, a shoe is not enough.

245
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,120
What about the other things?

246
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,400
If you think there's anything wrong with her,

247
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
you can tell me directly.

248
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
It's nothing.

249
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,440
Well...

250
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,440
What's wrong with you?

251
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,120
Today,

252
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Wei Liang and I

253
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,160
are fighting with each other.

254
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,720
We lost two times,

255
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,840
but I'm the only one who has a chest pain after we came back.

256
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,760
Are you hurt?

257
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,960
Wei Liang is also

258
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,520
so heartless.

259
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,880
It's nothing.

260
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,200
He can't hurt me with his kung fu.

261
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:46,880
But...

262
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,360
But he brought the protective mirror.

263
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,520
I didn't.

264
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,080
Well,

265
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,360
I'll tell them

266
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,720
not to add spicy food

267
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
and beef and lamb

268
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,880
in their meals these days.

269
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,120
Are you really okay?

270
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,280
Should I call the doctor?

271
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,120
No, no, no.

272
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,480
Let's eat.

273
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,360
You can't drink the soup.

274
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay.

275
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,960
Well...

276
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,440
Well...

277
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,400
Have some of this.

278
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,480
It's been a day since the mirror was broken.

279
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,440
What's wrong with it?

280
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,600
Don't touch it.

281
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,120
Be careful.

282
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,240
Be careful.

283
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,760
Since you got the protective mirror,

284
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
you can't even walk properly.

285
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,040
It's a token of Xiao Tao's love.

286
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
What a bad thing to wear.

287
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,040
I don't know how to show it.

288
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,000
This thing is used to protect you,

289
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,920
not to protect it.

290
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,320
But what does it mean?

291
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
If you can't handle it well,

292
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
it's simple.

293
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,560
You can send it to a cold place

294
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,480
and use the mirror.

295
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,480
Jealous.

296
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,160
What's wrong?

297
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,280
You're sneaky.

298
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,320
Let me ask you something.

299
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,440
Can a woman

300
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,240
give her husband a protective mirror

301
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,040
to protect her from the evil?

302
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,320
And to protect her from the evil?

303
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,240
What?

304
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
How can there be such a thing?

305
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,280
How can there be such a protective mirror

306
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,840
in the world?

307
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,880
It's coming soon.

308
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,120
I've visited all the shops in Yujin.

309
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,560
The protective mirror is either bronze or brass.

310
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
Gold, jade,

311
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
let alone silver,

312
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,080
no one has ever heard of it.

313
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,560
Isn't it a man's problem?

314
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,120
Since he has said it,

315
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,280
I think I should make it for him.

316
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,480
I sent a lot of gifts a while ago.

317
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,040
I remember there is a good white jade

318
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
and some yellow and white things.

319
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,320
You take it here.

320
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,320
Yes.

321
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,000
General.

322
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,360
General.

323
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Madam.

324
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
Young Master doesn't want to go back to Kang County.

325
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,000
He left the silver and the silver spear

326
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
and went to Yujin.

327
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,800
General chose the silver and the silver spear

328
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,120
to put down the horse.

329
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,240
We don't need to worry.

330
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,400
What else did he say?

331
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,600
He said he was in Yujin to see Madam.

332
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,680
Yuluo.

333
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
Go to save Young Master.

334
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,840
Yes.

335
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Here.

336
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,920
leader.

337
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,720
Go.

338
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,680
Yes.

339
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,320
The world is like a fairy tale.

340
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,540
Sister,

341
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,460
your voice is broken now.

342
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,180
If you keep singing,

343
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,860
I'm afraid your voice…

344
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,620
It won't get better anyway.

345
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,020
But,

346
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,220
in this case,

347
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,380
it's easier for me.

348
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
What do you mean?

349
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,460
Marquis Hui

350
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,300
is a loyal man.

351
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,060
If I break my voice because of him,

352
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,820
he must hold me back

353
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,580
and let me attend the wedding.

354
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,900
But, sister,

355
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,380
your voice

356
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,780
is broken.

357
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,340
Marquis Yu Wei…

358
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,060
Is it?

359
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,140
It's clearly that Yan Zhaomu

360
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,700
is looking for a beauty

361
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
to marry him.

362
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,320
He knows that I'm beautiful and green.

363
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,480
He's trying to take advantage of me.

364
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm willing to break my voice

365
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,480
because of this.

366
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,080
Yes.

367
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,080
You're right.

368
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
Go and prepare

369
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,240
the wedding dress.

370
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
But,

371
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
you can blame me.

372
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,360
But I have no choice.

373
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,320
Concubine tells me that

374
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,580
she's willing to marry me.

375
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,860
We've Memorial numbers and finances all the time.

376
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:35,020
Have you ever missed

377
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,940
Chuanớ條?

378
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,380
No.

379
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,460
Turns out he only dreams about you

380
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,380
Stuffed as always

381
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,860
Lan Jun

382
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,580
the list of e soup display is prepared

383
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,780
you can ship it in the next few days

384
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,300
well, thank you

385
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,140
I'll go with you.

386
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,900
I've prepared a gift for you.

387
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,340
I hope you'll like it.

388
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,940
I'll get back to work.

389
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,020
Lan Jun.

390
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,980
Lan Jun.

391
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,660
Madam Yulou is in the courier house.

392
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,860
She wants to see you.

393
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,220
I see.

394
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,620
Do you want me to go with you?

395
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,860
I promised you to take good care of her.

396
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,580
You've been preparing for the invitation.

397
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,540
I'll go by myself.

398
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,860
Isn't it great?

399
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,500
What?

400
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm vaccinallyныхilid.

401
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,820
I'm afraid I can't keep Ms. Yulou's snot

402
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,860
safe anymore.

403
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,820
Leave us.

404
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,820
Yes.

405
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,860
That's great.

406
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,900
Your Highness?

407
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,100
Ever since my sister passed away,

408
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,700
Iesty Chen brought out

409
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
that my sister

410
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
has bad karma

411
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,220
and good posture show.

412
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You of all the talents

413
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,140
in the world are jubilant against her.

414
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,660
So that no one can descendants days

415
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,620
by theliche.

416
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,900
Therefore, I have to do this all by myself.

417
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,540
Why youYeah your a woman?

418
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,980
I lived an ordinary life,

419
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,460
There is a miracle.

420
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,620
You don't know it.

421
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,300
The thief...

422
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,780
Zi Xin.

423
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,860
Get out.

424
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,460
Sister, let me explain.

425
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,860
The thief who forced you to be so elegant

426
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,900
is Qiao Yue from Yanzhou.

427
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,380
Qiao Yue?

428
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,100
Qiao Yue is looking for girls everywhere.

429
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,860
I heard that she is famous

430
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,260
and she is so poor.

431
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,940
She even tried to rape her.

432
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,780
The Qiao family is still in Xiaoqi.

433
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,260
Why is that?

434
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,060
Marquis Wei doesn't know that

435
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,420
Qiao Yue is looking for girls everywhere

436
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,100
not for herself,

437
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,860
but to give to Gezhou

438
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,340
to make the relationship worse.

439
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,460
This time, she raped my sister

440
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,220
to give to Marquis Wei

441
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,900
to stabilize her position

442
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,980
as a female monarch in Wei.

443
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,420
She must not know

444
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,300
that we were old acquaintances.

445
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,980
So she sent her nephew to chase me

446
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,220
to take me back to the Kang's Army.

447
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,860
Are you talking about Qiao Ci?

448
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,460
She is young

449
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,140
but she is cruel.

450
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,940
She chased me back

451
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,060
without any hesitation.

452
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,540
Thanks to my sister, Zi Xin,

453
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,740
we were lucky to escape.

454
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,460
But

455
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,420
it was a tough journey.

456
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,740
Even the last jade that Marquis left me

457
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,340
was not held by you.

458
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,660
I didn't want to bother you

459
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,180
with the large arrangement.

460
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,020
But now

461
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,580
I am really suffering.

462
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,700
How could this be?

463
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,740
I suffered so much

464
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,860
that I thought I could get my own voice.

465
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,060
Some people are better looked down

466
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,660
but nothing useful.

467
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,820
So I decided that

468
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,860
I could just go back.

469
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,420
I don't dare to be

470
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,660
and the dragon's mother.

471
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,300
But,

472
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,580
I have to ask you something.

473
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,740
I don't care what you think.

474
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,660
But you...

475
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,260
What do you think?

476
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,540
Did you really make me

477
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,140
become the beauty

478
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,220
and be with you?

479
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,940
I don't know that.

480
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,380
Well,

481
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,380
then I'm relieved.

482
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,500
It seems that the Qiao family has done it on their own.

483
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,180
Your sister should be unaware of it.

484
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,420
Don't

485
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,420
go to her for this.

486
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
Don't worry, Mrs. Mi Ru.

487
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,180
Qiao's family

488
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,860
must not know about this.

489
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
I won't blame her.

490
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
The Qiao family

491
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,380
has done such a terrible thing

492
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,300
and done such a terrible thing.

493
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,940
Today, she destroyed

494
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,260
the jade pendant left by Duke Bo.

495
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,260
Tomorrow, she will destroy

496
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,900
the reputation of the Wei family

497
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,260
that has been accumulated for generations.

498
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Don't worry, Mrs. Mi Ru.

499
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,300
I will definitely give you an explanation.

500
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,700
Rest well.

501
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,660
I'm leaving.

502
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,060
Zi Xin.

503
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,820
Sister.

504
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
Let's get together again.

505
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,420
Don't worry, sister.

506
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,460
The most rare thing on your body

507
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,820
is this noble aura.

508
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,540
You can't lose your identity at any time.

509
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,940
Wei Liang.

510
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,860
Master.

511
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,100
Yan State is collecting beauties

512
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
and sending them to Gezhou.

513
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,300
Do you know about this?

514
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,300
I heard that

515
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,540
a beauty appeared in Yao State.

516
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,300
Yan State sent someone to check it.

517
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,100
That's all.

518
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,380
Master, why are you angry?

519
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,380
Master.

520
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,620
You asked me to go to the female monk

521
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,900
and get the invitation back.

522
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,380
Do you want to confirm it again?

523
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,700
Song Zu.

524
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,500
Yes.

525
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,740
Wait.

526
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,860
Why are you here at noon?

527
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,560
Get the heels of your house Eventually avowed

528
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,780
before your cage

529
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,580
and send it off to your house.

530
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,900
Yes.

531
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,660
and try my best.

532
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,220
I think

533
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,060
the things on the list are good.

534
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,540
You should add a heater.

535
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,980
Zhou Che is tired and sick on the way.

536
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,340
Send him back.

537
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,020
Yes.

538
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,460
Your Majesty.

539
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,460
Your Majesty.

540
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,940
Something happened, Your Majesty.

541
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,300
It's a big deal.

542
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,460
Why are you so flustered?

543
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,860
Can't you just tell us?

544
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,900
Brother Dun said

545
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,780
that Nan Jun had taken the invitation

546
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
from the Count of Boya.

547
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
He said that Madam Yulou

548
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,620
had asked Nan Jun to report it.

549
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,620
Zhou Mu sent a young man to rape him

550
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,420
to strengthen your position.

551
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,700
He wanted to give it to Nan Jun.

552
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,020
Why is Uncle so muddled?

553
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,980
Zhou Mu did do it.

554
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,380
But why did he do it?

555
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,140
I don't know.

556
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,580
Brother Dun said

557
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,180
that Nan Jun had confirmed it.

558
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,060
Zhou Mu had spread the news

559
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
that he was searching for the beauty.

560
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,500
He also said that it was done

561
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,460
by Yan State and Weiguo.

562
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,380
Nan Jun is angry now.

563
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,980
Do you want to

564
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,460
beg for mercy for Yan State?

565
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,900
It's such a big thing.

566
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,020
We didn't send anyone.

567
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,420
It's...

568
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,060
It's so embarrassing.

569
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,940
Don't panic.

570
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,580
It's a serious matter.

571
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,340
It's hard to say for sure.

572
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,940
And he's angry now.

573
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,420
He can't be hard on him.

574
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,980
둥

575
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,420
Do you know what's this?

576
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,860
It's the jade pendant

577
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,220
she gave to Madam Yulou.

578
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,780
But when she came to the swing,

579
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,100
she broke it.

580
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm really sorry

581
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,380
for the final act.

582
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,060
do you still wish to become his wife?

583
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Pressure is enough for me.

584
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,860
I can appreciate

585
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,660
how you work with him.

586
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,540
You don't Mountain归いや

587
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,820
Nahjuxia we appreaciate the marriage without mother's blessing.

588
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
My father was always ill,

589
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,600
so he took me home

590
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,420
to asked what he was thinking

591
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,240
and then explain to Nang Jun.

592
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,300
If one day

593
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,340
Qiao Wei and Jia Qi have a dispute,

594
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,980
will you stand by my side?

595
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
I'm

596
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,860
on Nan Jun's side now.

597
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,500
This is not my fault,

598
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,620
but I can't get rid of it.

599
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,140
Tomorrow,

600
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,020
I'll go to ask Madam Yulou for forgiveness.

601
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,180
I'll help her fix the jade pendant.

602
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,620
No need.

603
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm not blaming you.

604
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,940
I'm just a little disappointed.

605
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
Your uncle

606
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
took the reputation of Qiao Wei

607
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,620
and committed crimes outside.

608
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,060
I must give the world an explanation.

609
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
But

610
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,340
the jade pendant

611
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,780
can't be your wishful thinking.

612
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,020
But many tough situations

613
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,340
can be understood by me.

614
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,420
You can't

615
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,700
only do it for your father.

616
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,620
Don't shed tears for me, father.

617
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,540
I knew her as if she was dead.

618
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:48,560
Trapping,

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,340
иты fureЕ fundamental.

620
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,780
Get back on your feet for a while

621
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,560
and apply Remote Control Ok to her.

622
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,840
You have to spend more time to please His Highness.

623
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,560
As long as you can get His Highness's love,

624
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,080
what's the use of him trying to make things worse?

625
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,680
Remember, you're the real head.

626
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,080
Understand?

627
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,560
I heard that Weiguo is holding a ceremony.

628
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,360
The invitation has been sent to His Highness.

629
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,160
I believe that as long as you get this chance

630
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,360
and make it famous,

631
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,760
the position of the Crown Prince will still be very stable.

632
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,960
If I go to Weiguo,

633
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm afraid that he'll be more pleased with his father.

634
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,360
I'm afraid that he'll be more pleased with his father.

635
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,960
He'll be more pleased with his father.

636
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,160
You are always like me.

637
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I must remind you that your position is already in danger.

638
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,760
Your Highness.

639
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,960
His Highness has sent a message. Please go over.

640
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,560
Father.

641
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,360
Princess Consort.

642
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,960
I called you here today to attend the ceremony.

643
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I've already planned to take Qi'er to the Imperial Army.

644
00:38:50,760 --> 00:39:09,960
consegu slime

645
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,760
who would bully a child?

646
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,200
If you want to make fun of me,

647
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,960
I lost my own marriage

648
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,120
and let the courtier take over.

649
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,240
I even offended the Marquis of Wei.

650
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,120
If I hadn't caused trouble,

651
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,240
how could your father have been so eager

652
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,520
to get back together with Marquis of Wei?

653
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,360
Why did you go to the Imperial Army

654
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,440
and take the blame?

655
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,400
I discussed with my father about the situation.

656
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,600
It's not the women's fault.

657
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,960
Your Highness.

658
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,720
How dare you!

659
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,920
How dare you offend your mother?

660
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,120
My mother has died of illness.

661
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Your Highness.

662
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,120
I've been disobedient to my stepmother since I was a child.

663
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,840
I've been rude to you.

664
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Stop it!

665
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,160
If you keep being insolent,

666
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,600
I'll kill you.

667
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Get out of here!

668
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Your Highness.

669
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Father.

670
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,040
You forced me to do so.

671
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Your Highness!

672
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Your Highness!

673
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,840
Please let me go!

674
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,160
It's so hot that I can't take it under my arm.

675
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,040
Your Highness.

676
00:40:46,520 --> 00:41:00,020
It's hot but it's so hot you won't set fire to the

677
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,080
Wasn't it hot for you to death?

678
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,200
Why are you playing like this?

679
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,920
Those who're loving do both love rice

680
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
What's wrong?

681
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I'm in the position of the fifth prince.

682
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
Aren't you happy?

683
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
You're the real thief.

684
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,960
Why are you being so cruel?

685
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Why don't you let me

686
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
talk to you about your mistake?

687
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Since you like Yushang so much,

688
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
if you don't argue with me anymore,

689
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
why don't you ask your father?

690
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I'm not afraid of you.

691
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Uncle is dead.

692
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Now, Liu Shan

693
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
is the slave of Lord Liangya.

694
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Do you understand?

695
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
The King Is들이

696
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Obviously in the dream

697
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,960
Sewing my finger

698

Artめて en Robot

699
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,860
Touching my heart

700
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,960
Like an ancients

701
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,940
Afterwards, the Gundai

702
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
No wishes

703
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,960
I once looked at the world in a blink of an eye,

704
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,960
but I was so blinded by it.

705
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,960
The wind and fire are always together,

706
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,960
like a eternal love, tender and firm.

707
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,960
In this world,

708
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,960
how can I forget you?

709
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,960
I am willing to cross the sea of mountains and sea,

710
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,960
I am willing to cross the sea of mountains and sea,

711
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,960
to wait for the white-leaf tree to grow.

712
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,960
The rain of Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows,

713
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,960
and my heart is sad.

714
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I am willing to sing a song to cover your smile,

715
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,960
even if it is a wind and a snowstorm after the rain.

716
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I am willing to sing a song to cover your smile,

717
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
even if it is a wind and a snowstorm after the rain.

718
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I am willing to cross the sea of mountains and sea,

719
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,960
to wait for the white-leaf tree to grow.

720
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,960
The rain of Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows,

721
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,960
and my heart is sad.

722
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I am willing to sing a song to cover your smile,

723
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
even if it is a wind and a snowstorm after the rain.

724
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,960
No matter how much I don't want to, it's just for this missing you.

725
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,960
This life is not forgotten.
