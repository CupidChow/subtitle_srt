30
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,460
You two,

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,130
I suggest you surrender.

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,330
This is Yanzhou.

33
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,980
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

34
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,690
Soldiers, you might not know,

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,900
but your governor

36
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,100
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

37
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,570
Liangya is hiding this

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,290
to divide Yanzhou later.

39
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,810
Really?

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,780
My brother is dead?

41
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,570
Qiao Yue is dead.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,290
So, the prefect is

43
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,380
the governor now.

44
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,540
Are you sure

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,690
you want to fight him now?

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,770
Don't listen to him.

47
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,930
Seize these two immediately.

48
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,710
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,370
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

50
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,320
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

51
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,170
let alone you.

52
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,940
Think carefully.

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
Will you listen to a Liangya man

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,170
or your prefect?

55
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,300
What should we do now?

56
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,170
Yeah.

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,610
Exactly.

58
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,570
What should we do?

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,660
What now?

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,170
Soldiers.

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,890
My brother

62
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,570
has been foolish for too long,

63
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,130
which led Yanzhou to this state.

64
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,820
If you don't betray me,

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,100
I won't

66
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,220
let your trust down.

67
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,290
Is the governor really dead?

68
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,170
I heard the same.

69
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,500
Even if he isn't,

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,660
I support the prefect.

71
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,100
The people believe him.

72
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,010
I support the prefect.

73
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,940
Me too.

74
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,170
Are you planning to rebel?

75
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,130
Seize that Liangya man.

76
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,890
Pass on my order:

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,720
Yanzhou will no longer

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,780
cooperate with Liangya.

79
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,260
Order Liancheng

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,450
to mobilize all troops

81
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,170
and retake Panyi.

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,820
Yes.

83
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,610
Prepare the finest coffin

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,290
for General Wei Liang.

85
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,170
Yes.

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,200
(The Governor of Yanzhou has defected,
planning to retake Panyi)

87
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,980
What can Qiao Ping do?

88
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,100
It's like an ant shaking a tree.

89
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,340
My Lord, you'll surely win.

90
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,300
However,

91
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,900
we can't

92
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,420
act rashly.

93
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,700
We have Daqiao.

94
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,340
Without Bi Zhi,

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,260
Yanzhou is not a threat.

96
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,540
Besides,

97
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,820
I have a special gift

98
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,140
for Wei Shao.

99
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,020
(Yujun City, Wei State)

100
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,820
My Lady,

101
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,780
Yujun lacks troops as expected.

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,020
Give me half a month,

103
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,400
and we can break through the gates.

104
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,260
You really are a fierce general.

105
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,140
Try your best to attack
with the Zhongzhou army.

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,780
Deputy Liu Xiao and 5,000 elite troops

107
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
will be under my command

108
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,900
to conserve our strength.

109
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,600
Yujun's troops were outnumbered,

110
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,700
but each one fought bravely.

111
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,180
This battle was thrilling.

112
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,020
Their bravery didn't matter.

113
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,220
They still lost.

114
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,900
General, you don't know.

115
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,060
The real thrill

116
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,420
is here.

117
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,730
(Trapped in Yongning)

118
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Wei Shao was trapped
in Yongning City for days

119
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,900
with reduced forces.

120
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,060
Two days ago, he broke out,

121
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
leading his leftover troops

122
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,060
to Panyi.

123
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,860
Wei Shao actually gave up Yujun

124
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,980
for Panyi?

125
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,380
Guess what would happen

126
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,380
if Lady Qiao knew
where Wei Shao had gone

127
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,340
when Yujun was under attack?

128
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,140
The Lord didn't abandon us.

129
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,740
He did what a lord should do.

130
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,940
Zhonglin has his mission.

131
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,460
Yujun

132
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,220
is counting on us now.

133
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,940
But Yujun's not the only one
that's trapped.

134
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,260
They're seriously outnumbered in Panyi.

135
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,540
It's extremely dangerous.

136
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,740
If I can buy the Lord some time

137
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,260
and hold back some troops,

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,220
he can take Panyi,

139
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,580
and peace will return.

140
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,740
But Yujun

141
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,460
already lacks troops.

142
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,140
It might not hold out much longer.

143
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,580
Well...

144
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,180
My Lady.

145
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
How's the battle going?

146
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,500
General Wei Xiao, General Qiao Ci, and I

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,740
are guarding three city gates,

148
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,260
but Xue Tai's forces are strong,

149
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,080
and there's no capable commander
in the city.

150
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,600
I fear we won't be able
to hold out for long.

151
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,580
What should we do?

152
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,680
Who says there's no capable commander
in the city?

153
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,020
I understand your concern
for the Wei Clan,

154
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,860
so I didn't take the chance
to attack Wei.

155
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Don't make

156
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,340
more requests.

157
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,660
Young Master.

158
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,940
Please leave.

159
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,900
We have sworn to follow you

160
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,980
so we'll only obey your orders.

161
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,460
We'll only obey your orders.

162
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,100
We're ready to go to battle with you.

163
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,140
Grandmother,

164
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,420
I'm back.

165
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,780
Shiyuan.

166
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,980
Shiyuan!

167
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,700
Shiyuan.

168
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,460
Shiyuan is back.

169
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,900
Lady Xu of the Wei Clan,

170
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,940
today,

171
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,620
Wei and Bianzhou

172
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,980
have formed an alliance

173
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,580
over the canal project.

174
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,580
Now,

175
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,660
with Yujun under siege,

176
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
I hope you can provide troops for me

177
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,180
to fight outside the city

178
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,420
and defend Yujun together.

179
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,860
Good.

180
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,300
Good!

181
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,500
I will give you troops.

182
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,780
Shiyuan,

183
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,700
you truly are the blood

184
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,580
of the Wei Clan.

185
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,900
(Wei Mansion)

186
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,980
Who are they?

187
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,360
They are soldiers from Bianzhou

188
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,780
coming to help Yujun with me.

189
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,060
They belong to Chen Pang?

190
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,020
Yes.

191
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,380
In the rush to help Yujun,

192
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,620
I neglected this.

193
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,980
If you care about their identities,

194
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,940
I will send them back.

195
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,780
Shiyuan.

196
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,380
Bianzhou and Wei

197
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,460
have old grudges,

198
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,740
but that's personal
between Chen Pang and me.

199
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,820
Today, all of you

200
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,380
(Wei Mansion)
followed Shiyuan here,

201
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,140
risking your lives

202
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,500
to support Yujun.

203
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,900
You are the saviors of Wei.

204
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,540
Please accept

205
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,220
my gratitude.

206
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,220
We chose to follow Young Master,

207
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,860
so we'll do our utmost

208
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,100
to live up to your trust.

209
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,100
Please rise, everyone.

210
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,340
Grandmother,

211
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,980
I'm going.

212
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,020
Be careful.

213
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,500
(Wei Mansion)

214
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,940
Let's hope they can return safely,

215
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,500
and eternal peace may come.

216
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,300
When the Lord triumphs,

217
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,500
the grand scene you spoke of

218
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,620
will surely come true.

219
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,660
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

220
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,340
(Qiao)

221
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,900
(Qiao)

222
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,700
Hyah.

223
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,220
(Panyi)

224
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,300
Hyah.

225
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,580
Whoa.

226
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,180
Do we

227
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,780
have to fight today?

228
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,620
You treat me like family,

229
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
but I have to fight against you

230
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,580
because my wife

231
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,820
is held hostage.

232
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,660
Bi Zhi!

233
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Wei Shao.

234
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,220
My Lord, ignore our relationship.

235
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,900
Attack.

236
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,780
Bi Zhi,

237
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,940
what are you waiting for?

238
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,620
Strike!

239
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,660
Bi Zhi, no!

240
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,340
Bi Zhi is a fitting name.

241
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,380
He's like

242
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,700
a filthy animal.

243
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
Look.

244
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,500
Does he look like a beast,

245
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,820
mindlessly controlled by others?

246
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,100
Bi Zhi,

247
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,940
if you don't hurt Wei Shao,

248
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,580
I'll hurt your wife instead.

249
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,380
How can you do this to him?

250
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,500
We can only do this to him

251
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,420
because of you.

252
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,700
Let go!

253
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,900
(Yujun City, Wei)

254
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,980
Kill them!

255
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,660
General Xue is dead!

256
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,780
Run!

257
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,860
General Xue is dead!

258
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,780
Run!

259
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,520
Retreat!

260
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Retreat!

261
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,620
(Yujun)

262
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,460
That green-eyed beast

263
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,900
really is fierce.

264
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,140
My Lord,

265
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,660
if Bi Zhi always serves you,

266
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,860
I believe

267
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,780
the realm

268
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,100
will eventually be yours.

269
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,220
Fierce or not,

270
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,540
he's just a wild animal.

271
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,380
Yes.

272
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,780
Bi Zhi,

273
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,180
if you don't disable his limbs,

274
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,820
I'll break your wife's.

275
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,700
Bi Zhi!

276
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,700
Stop being their puppet!

277
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,740
Don't mind me!

278
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,420
Bi Zhi is brave.

279
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,820
If the world is divided,

280
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,180
he'll surely have a place.

281
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,260
Sadly...

282
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,060
Sadly, he's foolish

283
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,020
to be tied down by a woman.

284
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,580
Don't talk like that about him.

285
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,540
Fool!

286
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,140
If you don't do it,

287
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,820
I'll push her down!

288
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,780
Do it!

289
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,900
I'll push her down!

290
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,420
Bi Zhi!

291
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,780
Bi Zhi, stop fighting!

292
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,300
Because in this world,

293
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,460
no one says we must always do
the right thing.

294
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,300
Manman.

295
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,220
I'd die for you

296
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,300
because you're my dearest cousin.

297
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,460
But I can't

298
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,980
ask Bi Zhi to die for you.

299
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,900
I can't use love to force him

300
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,100
to protect my family,

301
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,260
even you.

302
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,100
I won't regret it.

303
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,660
I can't use love to force him

304
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,420
and make him die

305
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,540
for my family

306
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,220
or even me.

307
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,360
The only person I want to protect

308
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
has always been just you.

309
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,300
I will never regret it.

310
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,020
Bi Zhi!

311
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,860
You're my lover,

312
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,420
not a beast to be controlled.

313
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,580
Darling,

314
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,780
if you ever

315
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,220
think back on today,

316
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
just remember:

317
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,500
I never regret it.

318
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,340
Don't jump!

319
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,540
Fan...

320
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
Fan...

321
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,420
Fan...

322
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,020
Fan...

323
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,300
Fan, wake up.

324
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,660
I don't want to be some commander.

325
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,900
Fan,

326
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,460
don't die.

327
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,820
Please don't die.

328
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,180
If you die,

329
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,500
what should Li and I do?

330
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,980
As long as you come back,

331
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,660
I'll do anything.

332
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,460
Fan!

333
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,020
Fan!

334
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,420
Fan!

335
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
Liu Yan,

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,660
I will make you

337
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,500
pay in blood!

338
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,900
I thought you could hold on longer,

339
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,140
but it seems you're useless after all.

340
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,220
So what if you two join forces?

341
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,060
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

342
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,380
That's more than enough

343
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,860
to handle you.

344
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,660
Xue Tai is dead.

345
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,540
Liangya is defeated.

346
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,020
Everyone, run for your lives!

347
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,700
Retreat!

348
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,660
Run!

349
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,900
- Retreat!
- Run!

350
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,900
Hurry, move faster!

351
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,460
- She's coming back!
- Yes!

352
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Hurry. There's also this.

353
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,460
Pack this up.

354
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,460
You want to betray me too?

355
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
We outnumber her.

356
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
No need to fear her.

357
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,340
Xue Tai is dead.

358
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,660
No one can protect her now.

359
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,820
Let's go

360
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,780
and kill her.

361
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,860
What are you doing?

362
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,020
How dare you!

363
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,300
What are you doing?

364
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,980
What are you doing?

365
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,980
She's really disfigured!

366
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,140
She's disfigured!

367
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,220
Your face...

368
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,540
Your face is ruined!

369
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,580
She's really disfigured!

370
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,820
You've all seen it.

371
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,700
Don't expect to live.

372
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,300
None of you can survive.

373
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,660
Be careful!

374
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
Don't kill me.

375
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,780
Lady Yulou.

376
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,620
Lady Yulou...

377
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Why?

378
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,580
You've seen

379
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,940
my face.

380
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm here to escort you away.

381
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,820
No need.

382
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,300
No need.

383
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,780
If Liu Yan knew

384
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,740
I looked like this now...

385
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,980
The Lord already knows.

386
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,260
Lady Yulou,

387
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,500
everything you eat, wear,

388
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,940
and use in Liangya

389
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,860
was arranged by the Lord.

390
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
How long

391
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,180
could you have kept it a secret?

392
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
The Lord said

393
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,780
if we lost this battle,

394
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,260
I should escort you to a safe place.

395
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,660
He's arranged an escape for you.

396
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,180
You...

397
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,100
Impossible.

398
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,940
You said no one in this world
cared for you,

399
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,620
but my brother loved you.

400
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Impossible.

401
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,060
He cherished you.

402
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,580
When he was dying,

403
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,340
he entrusted me to take care of you.

404
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,940
Chen Xiang

405
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
truly cared for you.

406
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,220
He built you a tall tower

407
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,420
and indulged you
in seeking profits for Wushan.

408
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,500
Impossible.

409
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,340
Liu Yan's love for me can't be real.

410
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,420
You ignore all these acts

411
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,500
of kindness.

412
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,900
Instead of blaming the world
for being unfair,

413
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,740
you should think about why you ignore

414
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,500
and shut out the care of others.

415
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:50,993
It's over.

We've won

427
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
this battle.

428
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,900
We've won.

429
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,740
Well done.

430
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,580
(May the Lord win.)

431
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,980
Kill them!

432
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,340
Kill them!

433
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,220
Hold the flanks.

434
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,060
Don't let them climb up.

435
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,900
Yes.

436
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,660
My Lord.

437
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,420
Bi Zhi and Wei Shao have gone mad.

438
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,340
This place isn't safe.

439
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,620
You should retreat to the rear.

440
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
What?

441
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,360
Do you think my army is weaker
than Wei Shao's?

442
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,700
No.

443
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,060
We outnumber Wei Shao's forces

444
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,380
by several times.

445
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,540
Even facing him head-on,

446
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,940
I'm not afraid.

447
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,660
Of course, you're not afraid.

448
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,900
But you needn't get hurt over this.

449
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,660
If you hadn't sent 5,000 guards

450
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,380
and General Liu Xiao
to protect the Lady,

451
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,700
I wouldn't be this worried.

452
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,100
You don't want me to favor the Lady?

453
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,580
Women pampered grow arrogant.

454
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,900
Please listen to my advice.

455
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,740
Shut up.

456
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,860
I swore to the Lady

457
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,300
that I'd kill Wei Shao in this battle.

458
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,900
Foolish.

459
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,780
Whoever conquers the world

460
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,540
cannot be controlled by a woman.

461
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
- Guards!
- Yes!

462
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,380
Take the Lord away.

463
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Move aside!

464
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,100
I told you

465
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,860
that my uncle is dead.

466
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980
If you can't accept that,

467
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,540
then go die.

468
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,180
If I kill Wei Shao,

469
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,100
the realm will be mine.

470
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,900
I'll be the Lord of Central Plains.

471
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,500
Soldiers of Wei are fierce.

472
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,740
Wei Shao,

473
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,380
even if you kill me,

474
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,380
Wei will still drown in floods.

475
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,380
You can't win against me.

476
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,260
You can't win!

477
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
My Lady,

478
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,900
I have broken my promise.

479
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,980
When all states prosper,

480
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,380
the world will have peace.

481
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,120
The water from the Yang River
is accessible

482
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,280
thanks to the Yongning Canal,

483
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,300
which runs

484
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,780
over 700 li,

485
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,260
chasing the sun across the sky.

486
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,460
The mighty stag

487
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,300
leaves north and goes south

488
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,860
straight to Yujun.

489
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,540
The mountains and rivers
stretch across the world,

490
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,980
nurturing all living things.

491
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,740
It's misty, yet there's no smoke.

492
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,660
With the sun and moon reflecting in it,

493
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,660
the spiritual energy from all directions

494
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,180
gathers on Central Plains,

495
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,860
turning swords and blades

496
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,140
to dust.

497
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,380
The canal links nine states.

498
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,700
It starts at Panyi,

499
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,460
goes through Xindu,

500
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,300
and stops at Rongjun,

501
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,380
improving the traffic condition,

502
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,300
encouraging peace,
and driving away the spiteful.

503
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,820
The next year after the completion,

504
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,340
Wei Shao, Lord of Wei,

505
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,940
and Liu Yan, Lord of Liangya,

506
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,340
fought here.

507
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,540
Scattered scars

508
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,700
were lost in the long river.

509
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,620
Good.

510
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,700
Master Zhenshi,

511
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,500
this poetic exposition

512
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,940
is a masterpiece.

513
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,660
But the 700 li

514
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,580
was from Panyi to Xindu.

515
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,580
Now that it reaches Rongjun,

516
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,060
it's probably over 2,000 li.

517
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,490
Not to mention

518
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,220
the full length to other states.

519
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,660
My Lord, if you're not satisfied,

520
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,340
shall I write another exposition

521
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,140
detailing the battle at Panyi that day?

522
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,220
No need.

523
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,100
These two lines

524
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,140
are enough.

525
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,260
Your exposition is so excellent

526
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,180
that deserves to be carved
on stone tablets.

527
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,580
But many things

528
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,460
shouldn't be depicted in detail.

529
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,900
No matter how fierce the war was,

530
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,900
people tend to remember

531
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,300
the beautiful memories

532
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,860
and those they truly liked.

533
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,620
How wise and insightful.

534
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,980
Your words make sense.

535
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
Tomorrow,

536
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,100
we'll offer the deer as a gift

537
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,660
to honor Wei as the leader.

538
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,300
My Lord,

539
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,260
please don't refuse.

540
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,260
We'll honor Wei as the leader.

541
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,740
Alright.

542
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,620
I won't fail your trust.

543
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,780
I will lead the people

544
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,500
and create lasting peace.

(Yujun)

547
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,940
I heard

548
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,420
Chen Pang failed to bring Mr. Wei

549
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,980
back to his family before he died.

550
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,460
It's a pity

551
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,780
he died of asthma.

552
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,700
That was mercy for him.

553
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,020
Shiyuan is now the Lord of Bianzhou.

554
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,700
Don't mention

555
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,500
these things again.

556
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,140
Yes.

557
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,420
Whoa.

558
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,420
Grandmother.

559
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
Shiyuan.

560
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,020
Congratulations on the succession.

561
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,260
May Bianzhou and Wei

562
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,780
remain forever friendly

563
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,900
and share eternal peace.

we brought good wine

I'm the one bringing the orchid

to propose to you.

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,740

these little weapons

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,100
represent us.

614
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,580
We weren't born on the same day

615
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,340
and probably

616
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,580
won't die on the same day.

617
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,100
But one day,

618
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,860
if we're all gone,

619
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,100
with these weapons buried together,

620
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,620
we'll always be brothers.

621
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,700
Seeing it

622
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,740
will be like seeing me.

623
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,340
Is this a sign

624
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,860
to stop fighting?

625
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,060
How did you manage to say that
in such a circumstance?

626
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,740
Sir.

627
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,700
Has the Lord been found?

628
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,840
He's not at the office.

629
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,060
Sir.

630
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,360
Not the training ground.

631

Sir.

632
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,580
Lady Xu also said

633
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,620
she hadn't seen the Lord.

634
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
The deer offering ritual
is about to start.

635
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,900
Without the Lord,

636
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,220
how can the ritual be completed?

637
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,060
Go fetch Lady Xu.

638
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,300
Only she can accept the deer

639
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,580
on behalf of the Lord.

640
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,900
- Hurry.
- Yes.

641
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,500
Don't cry.

642
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Stop crying.

643
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,500
Don't cry.

644
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,380

645
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,940
Mr. Gongsun couldn't find you

646
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,420
and brought Grandmother there.

647
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,300
- Why are you here?
- Well.

648
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,580
Feifei has been crying nonstop.

649
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,780
I couldn't go.

650
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,700
Alright.

651
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Good girl.

652
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,540
Come on.

653
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,260
Go to your mother.

654
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,180
Don't cry.

655
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,220
You're amazing.

662
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,740
(can be understood another way.)

663

(Whether it's to live a life)

664
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,060
(or conquer the world,)

665
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,940
(both sides working together)

666
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,900

668

669
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,740

my lifelong wish come true)
