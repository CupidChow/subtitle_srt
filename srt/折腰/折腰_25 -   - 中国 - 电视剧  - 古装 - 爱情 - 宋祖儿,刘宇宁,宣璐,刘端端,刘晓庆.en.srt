00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,020
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou)

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,060
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou;
Su Zixin, Wushan State)

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,570
He's good.

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,610
Young Master Ci's weapon
isn't quite handy.

34
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,730
Stop.

35
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,730
If he hadn't lost the spearhead,

36
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,980
then Su Zixin

37
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,100
might not have gotten close.

38
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,450
It's just a match.

39
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,660
Su Zixin struck fiercely

40
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
with no regard for honor.

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,260
Victory or defeat happens in an instant.

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,690
Su Zixin is truly bold.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,410
In a duel in the arena,

44
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,690
what matters is fairness and justice.

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,540
Since the weapon we prepared isn't good,

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,690
change it to one that suits you

47
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,970
and fight again.

48
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,410
- Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

49
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,940
Bring me

50
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,860
- my treasured spear.
- Yes.

51
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,340
Latest report:

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,780
Qiao Ci from Yanzhou

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,010
lost his spearhead

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,260
and was wounded.

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,500
Wounded? Then...

56
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,610
- Brave choice.
- Why?

57
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,410
Isn't he best at using the spear?

58
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,850
How could he get hurt?

59
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,980
What to do?

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Don't worry.

61
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,540
The match isn't over yet.

62
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,610
Let's wait and see.

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Bogong's spear...

64
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,810
You're our family's hope.

65
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,210
Take the spear.

66
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,580
(Peace and Prosperity)

67
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,340
Ci, be careful.

68
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,340
Don't worry.

69
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,370
This time, I'm well prepared.

70
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,020
He'll have to admit defeat.

71
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,210
Rest assured.

72
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,020
Good for Qiao Ci.

73
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,610
Watch out!

74
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,850
Is it over?

75
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,850
Yes.

76
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,220
What's the result?

77
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,050
He won!

78
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,310
Yanzhou won!

79
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,540
Yanzhou won!

80
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,780
That's great!

81
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,540
Who just said Yanzhou couldn't win?

82
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,380
Pay up.

83
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,410
You lost.

84
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,170
Don't look down on Young Master Ci.

85
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,290
- It's all yours.
- Wow, we won so much.

86
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,490
Exactly. What a poor judgment.

87
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,780
Duang, your judgment was spot on,

88
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,910
betting on Young Master Ci.

89
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,140
It wasn't me.

90
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,460
The Lord had his eye on him long ago.

91
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,610
He's the one with vision.

92
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,810
No wonder.

93
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,370
The Lord has a good eye too.

94
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

95
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,780
We'll bet again next time.

96
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,980
The warrior from Yanzhou has won.

97
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,140
Good!

98
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,700
- Good!
- Well done!

99
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,580
- Mr. Qiao.
- Excellent!

100
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,290
- Good!
- Well done!

101
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,890
- That was brilliant!
- How impressive!

102
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,540
Young Master Ci is impressive!

103
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,370
In a duel,

104
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,950
no malicious moves are allowed.

105
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,220
Su Zixin,

106
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,130
you tried to harm your rival
with a hidden weapon.

107
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,850
Is this the kind of conduct

108
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,130
taught in Wushan?

109
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,980
Su Zixin

110
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,420
tried malicious means.

111
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,940
His qualification
for further matches is revoked.

112
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,010
My Lord,

113
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,180
weapons are blind.

114
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,880
In the arena, one must go all out.

115
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,850
I simply didn't expect
that using hidden weapons

116
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,130
was against the rules.

117
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,890
I thought it was okay

118
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
but never thought

119
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,830
I'd end up hurting Young Master Ci.

120
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,330
Ehuang.

121
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
My Lord,

122
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,730
I failed in teaching him.

123
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,300
Zixin was

124
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,420
too eager to win

125
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,490
and lost his composure on stage.

126
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,100
But he had no intent to cause harm.

127
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,460
Please

128
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,770
don't blame him.

129
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,010
Sparring comes with bumps and bruises,

130
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,530
but I've fought many battles.

131
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,460
Whether it was intentional or not,

132
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,850
I can tell.

133
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,890
Su Zixin is crooked.

134
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,650
Lady Yulou,
if you don't keep him in check,

135
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,490
he'll only drag you down.

136
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,340
Wushan hasn't joined
the Deer Hunt for years.

137
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,460
Even if you return without success,

138
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,130
I believe your family

139
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,340
won't blame you.

140
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,260
My Lord,

141
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,220
actually, I haven't told you

142
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,380
the whole reason why I came.

143
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,770
My cousin acted poorly.

144
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,420
Sorry about that.

145
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,180
But we came to this event

146
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,940
not to seek glory

147
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,580
for Wushan.

148
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,820
(Xue Tai, Juejun)

149
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,770
I was once the Lady of Bianzhou.

150
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,820
After my husband passed,

151
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,730
the new lord of Bianzhou

152
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,490
couldn't tolerate his old subordinates,

153
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
forcing Xue Tai

154
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,770
to go independent.

155
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,420
Xue Tai has indeed rebelled.

156
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,100
It's not that Chen Pang
couldn't tolerate Xue Tai.

157
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,580
He just couldn't suppress him.

158
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,530
Besides Juejun,

159
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,010
he's seized quite a few territories too.

160
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,980
Yes.

161
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,420
He alone controls Juejun,

162
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,890
commanding 50,000 elite troops.

163
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,890
This time,

164
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,250
I came to find him a new master.

165
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,700
I believe General Xue

166
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,250
will achieve great things.

167
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,250
So, Lady Yulou

168
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,980
has powerful support behind her.

169
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,010
Xue Tai follows Lady Yulou.

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,650
(Xue Tai, Juejun)
If someone marries Lady Yulou,

171
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,420
wouldn't they get Xue Tai's troops

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,630
as a dowry?

173
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,660
Exactly.

174
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,220
My Lord,

175
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,730
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

176
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,610
However,

177
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,580
as the Lady of Bianzhou,

178
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,250
I have duties to fulfill.

179
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,340
General Xue

180
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,130
is loyal and steadfast.

181
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,530
I can't abandon him.

182
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
Yes.

183
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,490
What happened today

184
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,130
is my fault alone.

185
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,610
My Lord, please don't blame my cousin.

186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,250
Whom you befriend

187
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,420
is entirely up to you, Lady Yulou.

188
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,370
I don't care.

189
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,250
A few days later,

190
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,800
I'll be hosting a feast for the lords.

191
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,300
Send off the invitations for me.

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,730
Be sure to send one

193
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,850
to Lady Yulou too.

194
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,340
Understood.

195
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,700
Does it still hurt?

196
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,250
My Lord. Mr. Wei.

197
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,130
Why are you here?

198
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,460
Aren't you supposed
to be preparing for the feast?

199
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,460
Well,

200
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,490
Yan was worried about Qiao Ci,

201
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,850
so I brought him to check on him.

202
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,940
Yes, I'm concerned about Ci.

203
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,300
And I'm the only one who is.

204
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,100
It's just a cut.

205
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,300
Not serious.

206
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,890
You bled so much
and still say it's not serious?

207
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,220
Today's match was exhilarating.

208
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,770
That spear was perfect.

209
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,890
I could've gone

210
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,730
a few more rounds.

211
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,140
You need to be more steady.

212
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,260
Still, Qiao Ci's martial skills
are excellent.

213
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,490
Not many in Wei

214
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,420
can handle a spear like him.

215
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,850
Zhonglin, do you think

216
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,940
I should learn from Ci?

217
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,180
I think that would be wise.

218
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,020
Really?

219
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,730
However,

220
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,650
now that you've won

221
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,900
the Combat Champion,

222
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,460
you don't need to overexert yourself

223
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,370
at the hunt,

224
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,180
lest your sister worry.

225
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,820
Also, at the feast in a few days,

226
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,770
you'll represent Yanzhou.

227
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,700
Mind your words and actions.

228
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,770
Understood?

229
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,980
Yes, My Lord.

230
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,340
My Lord, Mr. Wei,

231
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll take care of him.

232
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,220
Don't worry.

233
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,690
Sure.

234
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,330
Rest well.

235
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,610
At the drill ground today,

236
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,610
the Lord even spoke up for me.

237
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,060
Looks like he cares about me.

238
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,130
The Lord has a cold face

239
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,890
but a warm heart.

240
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,980
Your heart is full of him.

241
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,370
I just said something nice about him,

242
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,980
and you're beaming.

243
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,890
I'm not defending him,

244
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,130
but the spear you used today

245
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
belonged to his brother.

246
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Wei Yan?

247
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,730
His late brother,

248
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,580
Wei Bao.

249
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,420
Really?

250
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,980
They say this spear

251
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
is an extraordinary and rare weapon.

252
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,100
I don't know how good
the craftsmanship is,

253
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,700
but the fact

254
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,650
that the Lord

255
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,220
was willing to lend you

256
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,460
his late brother's weapon

257
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,420
shows how much he values you.

258
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,370
You've won the Combat Champion today.

259
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,940
Don't get pompous.

260
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,250
Stay diligent every day.

261
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,610
Also,

262
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,730
don't forget what I told you

263
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,730
about the feast.

264
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,580
It seems there's no doubt
about the Hunt Champion winner now.

265
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,100
With so much talent,

266
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,010
Liangya has really risen lately.

267
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,770
Today's selection of the Combat Champion

268
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,490
and Hunt Champion

269
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,650
is truly satisfying.

270
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,700
Why not take this chance

271
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,980
to pick

272
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,010
a Top Belle as well?

273
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,220
Speaking of the top flower,

274
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,610
none surpass the peony.

275
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,300
Chen Pang was quite lucky.

276
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,370
No wonder he built the Yulou Pavilion.

277
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,010
With a belle by his side

278
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,380
and beautiful singing every night,

279
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,370
how fortunate he was.

280
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,530
Indeed.

281
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,940
Lady Yulou is beautiful;

282
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,580
the Lady of Wei is stunning.

283
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,730
If we're choosing beauties,

284
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,700
let's not be biased.

285
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,530
The Lord of Wei is here.

286
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,460
My Lord. My Lady.

287
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,970
Everyone, please take a seat.

288
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,730
Thank you, My Lord.

289
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,060
You should do this.

290
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,340
Governors,

291
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,300
today, the Lord of Wei

292
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,890
not only invites you to a feast

293
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,850
but also has prepared gifts for all.

294
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,770
Everyone,

295
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,850
please come here.

296
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,250
Let's go and have a look.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,040
This...

298
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,900
(Rongjun)

299
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,100
Is this

300
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,330
the map of the world?

301
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,330
Well...

302
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,490
Look here.

303
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,730
This is the canal

304
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,180
newly built in Wei.

305
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,490
(Panyi)
From Panyi to Rongjun,

306
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,980
it channels water along the route.

307
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,180
(Rongjun)
It brings water to the dry lands

308
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,330
and opens up trade routes
among three cities,

309
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,460
so more goods are able to circulate.

310
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,900
It's a triple-win solution.

311
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,860
What a major achievement.

312
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,290
It's truly great.

313
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,330
So, the Lord of Wei is just

314
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,330
holding this feast to show off?

315
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,330
Not quite.

316
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,420
It's about discussing how to share

317
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,620
the water source

318
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,140
with all of you.

319
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,660
What do you mean?

320
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,900
Wei has benefited

321
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,570
from the canal,

322
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,150
but I don't wish to keep them to myself.

323
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,220
That's why I host the Deer Hunt

324
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,220
and serve food and wine

325
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,730
to let everyone know:

326
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,330
Only with favorable weather

327
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,010
can we have peace and prosperity.

328
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,050
So, you mean

329
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,900
we should also build canals?

330
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,060
Indeed.

331
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,140
I hope to extend the Yongning Canal
in all directions,

332
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,940
connecting every river

333
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,330
across the Central Plains.

334
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,220
In this way,

335
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
we can solve the drought problem

336
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,450
and ease the suffering of our people.

337
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,660
Most of the wars in the Central Plains

338
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,570
have been over water.

339
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,490
The people suffer terribly.

340
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,660
When I went to Panyi

341
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,090
to inspect the Yongning Canal,

342
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,050
I saw the refugees with my own eyes

343
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
in rags,

344
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,660
living in the open.

345
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,330
If we in power

346
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,810
only chase pleasure and power

347
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,940
instead of trying

348
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,460
to ease people's pain,

349
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,010
we'll surely

350
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,980
face the consequences one day.

351
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,660
You're right.

352
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,220
The people in Yenzhou have been

353
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,980
suffering from drought for years.

354
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,420
I've long wanted

355
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,290
to learn from Wei.

356
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,050
I'm on board if you can keep your word

357
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,860
and divert water to Yaozhou.

358
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,290
It does sound

359
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,620
feasible.

360
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,460
Indeed.

361
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,290
Lord of Liangya,

362
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,010
what do you think?

363
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,460
I do not agree.

364
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,370
Why not?

365
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,700
You only want to use the canal

366
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,420
to control our armies.

367
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,980
Why should I accept that?

368
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
To show good faith,

369
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,010
I will dispatch troops

370
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,050
to help with canal construction.

371
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,830
Since you're sending troops
for the canal,

372
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,420
may I ask what your real purpose is,

373
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
the troops or the canal?

374
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,090
That's right.

375
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,900
Once the canal is complete,

376
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,380
troops from other states

377
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,700
will be able to reach

378
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,490
our heartlands by water.

379
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,380
How will we

380
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,730
defend ourselves then?

381
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,330
- Right?
- Yeah.

382
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,180
He's got a point.

383
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,460
There's something more to discuss.

384
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,010
Yes, yes.

385
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,620
You're overthinking it.

386
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,420
The benefit of the canal

387
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,490
is not only easier travel

388
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,700
but better livelihoods and peace.

389
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,330
Ten years ago,
Yanzhou relied solely on the weather.

390
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,570
Harvests depended

391
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,730
on luck.

392
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,570
When my grandfather
wanted to build the canal,

393
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,490
the people were against it.

394
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,290
He went around persuading them

395
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,490
and even dug the canal himself.

396
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,900
Only after the first canal was built

397
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,860
did the people begin to understand.

398
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,290
Thanks to the newly rebuilt
Yongning Canal by the Lord of Wei,

399
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,140
trade between Yanzhou and Wei

400
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,330
has been flourishing.

401
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,250
Yanzhou is now much more prosperous.

402
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,730
That's the true value of the canal.

403
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,810
Tell me, My Lady,

404
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,380
are you speaking

405
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,700
for Wei or Yanzhou?

406
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,330
I am both a Wei

407
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,460
and a Qiao.

408
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,360
My Lady, since you're married,

409
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,140
of course,
you're speaking for the Wei Clan.

410
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,250
Don't you agree?

411
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,420
Yes.

412
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Certainly.

413
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,380
Then may I speak for Yanzhou?

414
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,810
- You?
- He...

415
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,490
Young Master Ci may be young,

416
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,490
but he's the future Governor of Yanzhou.

417
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,420
He can represent Yanzhou.

418
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,780
Yenzhou lacks water.

419
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,900
For the past three years,
things have been worse.

420
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,460
The rivers have dried up.

421
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,490
Crops have withered.

422
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,570
As far as I know,

423
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,700
tens of thousands

424
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,620
are displaced by hunger every year.

425
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,490
Why won't Yenzhou build canals?

426
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,490
Taozhou is low-lying

427
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,460
and plagued by floods.

428
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,660
It's known as the State of Floods.

429
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,420
During disasters,

430
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,530
the people beg for food elsewhere

431
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,620
only to return when the floods pass.

432
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,940
Even so, they won't abandon their homes.

433
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,780
Sir,

434
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,620
how can you turn a blind eye to this?

435
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,660
The people in Zhongzhou
are hardworking.

436
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,570
They produce silk and fruit
in abundance.

437
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,730
But rough terrain

438
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,050
blocks trade routes.

439
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,420
Goods must be carried over mountains

440
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,050
through human labor.

441
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,050
Many lives are lost each year

442
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,420
because of this.

443
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,140
In such a circumstance,

444
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,810
why do you refuse to build the canals?

445
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,140
You...

446
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,250
Fourteen years ago,

447
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,290
the Qiaos and Weis

448
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,730
became bitter enemies.

449
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,180
The Lord of Wei once swore

450
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,460
to wipe out the Qiao Clan.

451
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,770
Yet he married my sister.

452
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,940
Why?

453
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,010
Because he knows

454
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,530
his people have suffered

455
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,010
from water disasters for too long.

456
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,140
To build the canal,

457
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,730
he's willing to set aside hatred.

458
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,420
With such vision and magnanimity,

459
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,250
what are you afraid of?

460
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,780
Right.

461
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,330
Well said, Young Master Ci.

462
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,460
Yenzhou agrees

463
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,620
to build the canal.

464
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,570
We have plenty of people in Zhongzhou.

465
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,860
Maybe we can contribute labor.

466
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,050
Yaozhou can provide funding.

467
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,620
Taozhou

468
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,860
agrees as well.

469
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,460
The Lord of Wei went to great lengths
to host this event

470
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,220
and even sent a brother-in-law
to persuade us.

471
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,570
He just wants to bring the states

472
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,490
under his rule.

473
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,980
It's fine if the rest of you yield,

474
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,250
but I won't.

475
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,940
Today, I'll swear

476
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,810
that as long as I hold power,

477
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,490
I'll never become one's subordinate.

478
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,330
The Lord of Wei isn't doing this

479
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,220
for his own gain.

480
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,090
I'll write to Xue Tai

481
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,250
and persuade him

482
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,420
to help.

483
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,490
Thank you all

484
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,860
for your trust in me.

485
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
To show my sincerity

486
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,700
and speed up the canal project,

487
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,250
I will dispatch 100,000 elite soldiers

488
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,530
and over a dozen waterworks supervisors

489
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,280
to assist with your canal construction.

490
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,860
You're truly magnanimous.

491
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,440
We are willing to help Wei

492
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,090
in this endeavor.

493
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,610
Thank you, everyone.

494
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,730
- You're too kind.
- Don't mention it.

495
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,940
Goodbye.

496
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,980
Ci.

497
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,220
My Lord.

498
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,900
Thank you for today.

499
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,570
I was too harsh on you before.

500
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,870
Please don't take it to heart.

501
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,530
But you treat my sister well.

502
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,220
I also had some prejudice
against you before.

503
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,340
Later, I realized
it was a misunderstanding.

504
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,860
You nearly fell off a cliff

505
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,900
to save my sister in Rongjun.

506
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,770
That's what I should do for her.

507
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,220
You even fought off hundreds

508
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,460
of refugees alone to rescue her.

509
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,900
It wasn't that dramatic.

510
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,080
You refused to take concubines

511
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,010
for her

512
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,940
and even quarreled with your own kin.

513
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,380
You sent away all your mistresses

514
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,460
just to make her happy.

515
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,460
Did she tell you all that?

516
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,490
In this world,

517
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,980
besides me and Father,

518
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,490
no one else would go that far.

519
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,940
She's really gone all out

520
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,900
praising me.

521
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,370
However,

522
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,620
seeing you stand on your own today,

523
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,490
I believe

524
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,770
she's very proud.

525
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,660
Actually,

526
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,810
I was afraid she'd scold me.

527
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,360
She spent hours yesterday

528
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,940
telling me about each state's situation

529
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,530
for the speech today.

530
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,490
I was worried I'd misidentify someone
and make a scene.

531
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,010
Luckily, I bluffed my way through.

532
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,140
She told you what to say?

533
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,460
I should have guessed.

534
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,810
Still, you did great.

535
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,980
(Government Office)

536
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,290
What brings you here?

537
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,980
Is there no more work at the office?

538
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,620
It's all handled.

539
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,530
Ci told me everything.

540
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,340
I just want to ask you:

541
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,290
How did you come up with all that

542
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,330
to compliment me?

543
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,180
Ci's still a kid.

544
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,250
He misunderstood you before.

545
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,620
I just wanted to comfort him.

546
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,380
Please don't blame me

547
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,140
for making things up.

548
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,530
How could I?

549
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,900
You've had a hard time.

550
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,290
I promised to help you build the canal.

551
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,620
It's what I should do.

552
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,380
So,

553
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,570
you only did all that

554
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,010
because you promised me?

555
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,940
No other reason?

556
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,180
I have to fulfill

557
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,700
my promise to you.

558
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,180
You once told me this.

559
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,810
You said

560
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,810
that not every Qiao

561
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,090
is scheming

562
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,140
or calculating.

563
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,250
I didn't believe you then.

564
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,290
But now I do.

565
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,380
I was narrow-minded before.

566
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,900
Please don't blame me.

567
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,810
When we were just married,

568
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,050
we both had hidden motives.

569
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,660
I don't know when it started,

570
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,810
but I no longer want
to hide things from you

571
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,900
or lie to you.

572
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,420
I want sincerity between us.

573
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,530
Because

574
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,660
of one Letter of Marriage,

575
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,330
we went from strangers to family.

576
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,250
Now, I have a question:

577
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Do you want to become my true wife?

578
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,260
(Government Office)

579
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,420
After so much we've gone through,

580
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,980
am I not your true wife to you?

581
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,460
(The Lord of Liangya
will hold a banquet.)

582
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,900
(Please grace us with your presence.)

583
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,060
Ehuang.

584
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,600
I found out something.

585
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,570
Liu Yan killed his father

586
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,460
and brother to become
the Lord of Liangya.

587
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,620
Good for him.

588
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,900
Ehuang,

589
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,460
if you plan to remarry,

590
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,870
shouldn't you pick someone
with a better chance of winning?

591
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,530
Judging by today's feast,

592
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,050
I think the Lord of Wei

593
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,220
seems quite respected.

594
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,160
He might be the one
to unify the Central Plains.

595
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,010
But he already has a wife,

596
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,380
and he's hard to control.

597
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,660
Now that the Deer Hunt is over,

598
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,620
all the powers will start to leave.

599
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,180
I have no reason to stay.

600
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,900
You mean

601
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,570
you're going after the Lord of Liangya?

602
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,380
Spread the truth

603
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,420
about Liu Yan.

604
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,610
This...

605
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,090
Well...

606
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,250
One's mind is the hardest

607
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,250
and easiest to control.

608
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,810
As long as you understand

609
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,570
what a person truly wants

610
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,700
and what they're thinking,

611
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,420
you can control them

612
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,730
like controlling

613
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,050
a puppet.

614
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,220
Have the invitations all been sent?

615
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,010
Why hasn't anyone shown up?

616
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,250
Everything was fine before.

617
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,250
However,

618
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,220
everyone suddenly knows
about what you did

619
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,490
in Liangya overnight.

620
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,420
I told you.

621
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,180
You were the rightful heir.

622
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,900
- Why...
- It's just an excuse.

623
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,050
They're avoiding my invitation

624
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,330
because I've fallen out with Wei Shao.

625
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,490
They're all afraid to take a side.

626
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,570
My Lord,

627
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,460
Yenzhou sent word

628
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,570
that the governor got drunk

629
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,720
and can't attend the banquet.

630
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,060
- Leave.
- Yes.

631
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,860
My Lord, the Governor of Yaozhou
suddenly fell ill.

632
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,460
The Governor of Zhongzhou was occupied.

633
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,560
Neither of them can make it.

634
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,700
Is Lady Yulou not coming either?

635
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,380
Please don't misunderstand my cousin.

636
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,660
She couldn't bear to see you drink alone

637
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
and came to attend.

638
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,940
I heard you

639
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,460
were raised by others

640
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,530
and grew up in Yanzhou.

641
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
So what?

642
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,900
I am similar to you.

643
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
I grew up

644
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,490
in Yujun.

645
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,490
People like us,

646
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,620
unloved by our families,

647
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,530
are given away like pawns

648
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,420
from a young age.

649
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,380
We are never favored by fate.

650
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,940
I came today

651
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,730
to comfort you.

652
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,730
You did no wrong

653
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,520
by killing your father and brother.

654
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,090
They used you and discarded you

655
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,180
when you were no longer useful.

656
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,860
You tried to please them but failed.

657
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,770
You lived in constant fear

658
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,530
of being replaced.

659
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,290
The pain you feel

660
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,250
is something few can understand.

661
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,620
Yet you can?

662
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,860
I was born in Wushan.

663
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,010
I'm from the declining Su Clan.

664
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,250
Since childhood,

665
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,860
they said my forehead birthmark

666
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,490
looked like a peony,

667
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,420
symbolizing the rare empress's fate.

668
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,290
All these years,

669
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,900
I have taken it upon myself

670
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,940
to help revive the Su Clan,

671
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,980
carefully managing
my marriage prospects.

672
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,490
Until one year,

673
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,570
I suddenly discovered

674
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,570
they had another girl

675
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,860
with seven moles on her palm.

676
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,090
They said that was

677
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,380
a once-in-a-thousand-year fate.

678
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,090
At that moment, I realized

679
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,530
I was just a pawn to them,

680
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,220
which was replaceable

681
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,010
when no longer useful.

682
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,810
What became of that girl?

683
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,090
She was disfigured.

684
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,220
You did not come only

685
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,770
to confide in me, right?

686
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,900
I have wandered all my life

687
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,660
and used to people

688
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,810
coveting my beauty

689
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,090
and fate.

690
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,330
Right now,

691
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,970
I just want to find
a like-minded partner

692
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,960
to discuss the great cause with.

693
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,420
Have you been to Liangya?

694
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,250
Not yet.

695
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,110
Liangya is beautiful this time of year.

696
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,050
After the Deer Hunt,

697
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,730
I can take you there

698
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,380
to enjoy the scenery.

699
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,570
Thank you, My Lord.

700
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,670
Liangya is not the only place

701
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,520
with beautiful scenery in the world.

702
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
It's late now.

703
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,050
I will take my leave.

704
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,100
I have no intention
of relying on Liangya.

705
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
I only wish

706
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,140
to form a good bond with you.

707
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,810
In the future,

708
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,330
if I need help,

709
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,220
I hope you will assist.

710
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,780
My Lord,

711
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,490
Lady Yulou

712
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,570
just wants to plant that flower
on her head

713
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,300
in good soil.

714
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,460
Don't be fooled by her.

715
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,690
I know well

716
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,780
she is just pretending.

717
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,260
Then why are you

718
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,490
so melancholic?

719
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,340
She reminds me of someone.

720
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,210
Lady Qiao.

721
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,780
These days,

722
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,380
you've been reunited with old friends.

723
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,690
That'd certainly remind you of the past.

724
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,300
Just now,

725
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,780
I suddenly understood

726
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,530
why she abandoned me

727
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,170
in Panyi that day.

728
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,090
Lady Qiao was born

729
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,570
in the Qiao Clan,

730
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,260
raised in luxury,

731
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
and loved by her grandfather and uncle.

732
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,610
Lady Ding treats her
like her own daughter.

733
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,420
Besides,

734
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,820
she has siblings
like Daqiao and Qiao Ci.

735
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,460
If I were her,

736
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,170
I'd sacrifice

737
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,050
for a family like that too.

738
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,380
I'd also swear

739
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,260
to protect all the people.

740
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,300
However, I had

741
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
no maternal family protection

742
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,340
and was bullied by a wicked woman.

743
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,820
As Lady Yulou said,

744
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,210
people like us

745
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,420
only deserve to live like tools.

746
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,340
We're always living in fear.

747
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,210
One misstep

748
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,340
can lead to being scorned

749
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,210
and rejected.

750
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,260
Lady Qiao is high above.

751
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,130
We're fated on separate paths.

752
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,820
It's not that I see others as ants

753
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,490
but that I was born

754
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,340
like an ant.

755
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,570
Lady Yulou is the same.

756
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,060
(Virtuous Words)

757
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,170
The Lord of Liangya
asked me to send this.

758
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,010
Did he say anything?

759
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,390
The Lord said

760
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
he'd depart from Yujun tomorrow.

761
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,650
With this pearl as a token,

762
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,690
he'd like to invite you

763
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,900
to visit Liangya in the future.

764
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,690
Thanks to the Lord of Liangya.

765
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,650
I'll take my leave.

766
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,210
Put it away.

767
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,420
Yes.

768
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,340
You must be careful on the way.

769
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,460
If only I hadn't let Yulu
return to Kangjun first.

770
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,010
Then he'd be there to look after you.

771
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,440
I came alone,

772
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,530
and I will

773
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,820
leave alone.

774
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,660
Enough.

775
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Without me by your side,

776
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,460
you must work hard every day.

777
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,820
Tell Father that I'm fine.

778
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,860
Tell him not to worry.

779
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,880
Also,

780
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,010
when you pass by Boya on your way back,

781
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,650
make sure to send
some supplies to Cousin.

782
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,210
It's no better than Yujun or Kangjun.

783
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,380
Cousin's life must be hard.

784
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,300
Noted.

785
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,620
My Lord,

786
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,980
I'm entrusting my sister to you.

787
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,570
If I ever find out

788
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,780
you don't treat her well,

789
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,340
I will seek justice

790
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,460
for her myself.

791
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,330
Mr. Wei.

792
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,140
Let's drink together another day.

793
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,570
Drinking is fine,

794
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,820
but you can't go to places

795
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,040
like Luozhong Tavern anymore.

796
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,140
Understood?

797
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,900
Do you want to know

798
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,610
whose horse is faster,

799
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,740
Qiao Ci's or mine?

800
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,140
Let's go.

801
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,820
Hyah!

802
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,530
My Lord,

803
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,690
Lady Yulou wants to see you.

804
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:22,970
Is she leaving?

805
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,160
Lady Yulou said

806
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,260
she couldn't leave for now

807
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,490
and begged for your protection.

808
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,340
This is my fault.

809
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,820
I forgot that a jade
is a crime in itself.

810
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,860
At the Deer Hunt,

811
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,980
I revealed what I have.

812
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,690
Both the Lord of Liangya
and the Governor of Taozhou

813
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,570
want to force me into marriage now.

814
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,170
For now,

815
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,080
I don't even dare return to my family.

816
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,380
That worthless family of mine

817
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,740
would surely push me out.

818
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,010
Back then,

819
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,260
I was forced to marry Chen Xiang.

820
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,130
It was the same situation.

821
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,650
I was too young then

822
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,610
to decide for myself.

823
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,780
But now,

824
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,780
I no longer wish

825
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,760
to be a puppet used for gain.

826
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,260
For the sake of Bogong,

827
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,780
Zhonglin,

828
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,940
may I stay in Yujun for a while

829
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,650
to hide away?
