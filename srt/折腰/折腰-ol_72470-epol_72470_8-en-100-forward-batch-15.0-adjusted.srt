30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,510
Inside is something

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,920
precious to you.

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,200
To scar it with a knife

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,360
is to scar your heart.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,760
Who could it be?

35
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,630
Yeah, that's it.

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,230
If Lady Qiao touched

37
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,920
the box herself,

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,600
we can't be blamed.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,950
Now that Lady Qiao

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,480
has crossed Shao's taboo,

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,880
no explanation will save her.

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,600
That wooden box

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,480
has been with Zhonglin for over ten years.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,760
He's very attached to it.

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,160
Even the servants in the west wing aren't

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,600
allowed to move it during cleaning.

47
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,360
Honestly, I have no idea what's in it.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,040
Could it be

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,710
some rare treasure?

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
Whatever it is,

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,360
Lady Qiao has clearly

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,670
angered Shao.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,060
Once he's angry, he'll surely

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,740
drive her from the main chamber.

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,900
Chuyu,

56
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,300
now,

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,060
you're the only one who truly

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,740
cares about me and gets me.

59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,540
I lost my parents young.

60
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,420
If not for you, Aunt,

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,260
I'd have wandered homeless.

62
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,580
As long as you're happy,

63
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,260
I'd die to repay your kindness.

64
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,900
My Lady!

65
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
His Lordship is here!

66
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,860
Go, go, go.

67
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,300
My Lord.

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,540
Mother.

69
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,940
Son, what brings you

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,300
here so suddenly?

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,780
I came here today,

72
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,820
hoping to seek your advice.

73
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,620
Come, have a seat.

74
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,540
Zhonglin,

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,500
what is it?

76
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,780
There's a box in my study.

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,740
The servants all know not to touch it.

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,220
But today,

79
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,820
I found scratches on it.

80
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,860
Someone clearly tried to pry it open.

81
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,660
Mother, do you know

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,460
anything about this?

83
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,380
Outrageous!

84
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,900
Who would dare?

85
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,500
If I ever find out who did this,

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,020
they're not getting away with it!

87
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
But Zhonglin,

88
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,500
have you asked Lady Qiao about this?

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,820
She knows best

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,220
what goes on in your study.

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,780
Mother, you think

92
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,980
it was Lady Qiao?

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,980
I'm not accusing her.

94
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm just worried

95
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,540
she's gotten arrogant

96
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,620
because of

97
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,020
your favor.

98
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,260
She may be tuning you out.

99
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,900
Or maybe

100
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,780
she got curious

101
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,260
and tried to

102
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,140
dig into your secrets.

103
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,580
Mother, you may not know.

104
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,060
That box only

105
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,700
held some of my old things.

106
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,260
Once I took them out,

107
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
the box was empty.

108
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,220
Lady Qiao saw the nine-square lock
thought it was interesting,

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,700
so she asked to keep it.

110
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,500
I showed her

111
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,860
how to open it.

112
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,300
She got bored after a few days.

113
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,660
Then she used it to store some jewelry.

114
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,340
And today,

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,780
this happened.

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,380
I've thought it over carefully.

117
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,020
If it wasn't someone with bad intentions,

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,020
then it was a thieving servant.

119
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,140
You've managed the household for years,

120
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,540
so you must know what to do.

121
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,140
I came to ask your advice.

122
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,340
Alright,

123
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,180
I understand now.

124
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,540
Don't worry, son.

125
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,420
I'll look into it first thing tomorrow.

126
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,660
Very well, I'll leave it to you.

127
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,260
Please resolve it as soon as possible.

128
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,060
If it gets too complicated,

129
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,580
I can have Nanny Zhong

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,660
help you out.

131
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,620
No need, really. It's fine.

132
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,980
Also, about Zheng Shu,

133
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,180
I've got a solution

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,940
that works for both sides.

135
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,700
Since you want her to keep you company,

136
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,980
I'll find a good husband for her and have him

137
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,380
marry into our family.

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,580
That way,

139
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,780
her future is secured,

140
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
and she can stay by your side.

141
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,420
What do you think?

142
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,540
Zhonglin!

143
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,740
I know your kindness, son.

144
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,300
Let me

145
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,060
think about it.

146
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,460
Alright.

147
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,820
Once you decide,

148
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,900
let me know.

149
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,900
Just don't use this matter

150
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,100
to trouble Lady Qiao again.

151
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,460
After all,

152
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,660
she is the Lady of Wei.

153
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,780
Yes.

154
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,780
I have other matters,

155
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,780
so I'll take my leave.

156
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,900
Mr. Zhang said

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,420
he came to deliver gifts to Her Ladyship.

158
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,260
There's silk, chiffon,
brocade, satin, and damask,

159
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,140
(Inventory)
200 bolts of each,

160
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,700
totaling 1,000 bolts.

161
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,940
That's a lot of fabric.

162
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,340
If it were all made into dresses,

163
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,140
it'd be enough to last a lifetime.

164
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,180
Pick out some to send to His Lordship.

165
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Ten carts full from Yanzhou,

166
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,780
with gifts for Lady Zhu
and Lady Xu: fine-made gowns

167
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,300
and two sets of gold accessories.

168
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,060
Oh, and these two chests are from Lady Ding.

169
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,340
She specially prepared them for you, My Lady.

170
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,820
It's neither a festival

171
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,540
nor a special occasion.
Why send so many gifts now?

172
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,180
My Lady,

173
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,420
a letter from Yanzhou.

174
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,180
(Don't be anxious. Uphold feminine virtue.)

175
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,420
(The Boya conflict was not my doing.
I won't send troops.)

176
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,500
Where is Zhang Pu?

177
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
He is waiting outside.

178
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,260
(Yanzhou never betrays. From Qiao Yue.)

179
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,460
Cousin asked Yanzhou for aid.

180
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,260
Why can't Uncle see the bigger picture?

181
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,700
He refused to send troops

182
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,820
and completely ignored it.

183
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,060
If we miss this military window,

184
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,620
and fail to take Boya,

185
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,660
what future does our Qiao family have

186
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,460
if Lord of Wei turns on us?

187
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,420
"Future"?

188
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,860
We've already hit rock bottom.

189
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,620
I thought you'd forgotten

190
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,980
your own family in Yanzhou.

191
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,220
While His Lordship and I

192
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,580
were struggling in Kangjun,

193
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
we heard you

194
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,060
and Lord of Wei

195
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,180
were deeply in love.

196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,740
If you hadn't insisted on giving Panyi

197
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,580
as dowry to Lord of Wei,

198
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,940
he wouldn't have stationed his troops there.

199
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,660
Now Yanzhou doesn't dare to make a move!

200
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,740
He stationed his troops in Panyi?

201
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,460
It's been over a month.

202
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,820
Troops have been coming in waves.

203
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,940
And I didn't even notice.

204
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,620
My Lady, His Lordship wanted to ask you

205
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,860
about Lord of Wei's intentions.

206
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
But now we see,

207
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,940
you were just kept in the dark.

208
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,740
Troops in Panyi?

209
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
Alright then.

210
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,340
I'll use Wei Shao's might

211
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,820
to plant the Qiao family flag in Boya.

212
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,460
My Lady, I'm afraid that's a pipe dream.

213
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,620
We'll see if I can make it happen.

214
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,620
(Bianzhou, Wei)

215
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,660
My Lady,

216
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,900
which of these fabrics

217
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,300
would suit His Lordship best?

218
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,700
None!

219
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,340
Did he marry me for some fabric?

220
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,340
So what did he marry you for?

221
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,180
A few more cities

222
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,340
might satisfy him.

223
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,380
No.

224
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,380
Even if I gave him more cities,

225
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
he'd never be satisfied.

226
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,900
Even if he swallowed me whole,

227
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,500
he's still want more.

228
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,660
Haven't seen you angry in a while, My Lady.

229
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm not angry.

230
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,100
I just remembered
what Grandfather used to say.

231
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,260
Living each day...

232
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,060
Is like ruling a kingdom.

233
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,300
You want strong allies,

234
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,340
but not ones

235
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,940
too strong to control.

236
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,660
I should blame myself

237
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,740
for thinking I could ever live with him.

238
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,300
All he cares about is conquest.

239
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,100
This one looks nice too.

240
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,940
Look.

241
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,100
My Lady, His Lordship

242
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,980
said he's tied up with official matters,

243
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,100
so he won't be greeting you.

244
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,580
But Lady of Wei came here.

245
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,380
What is she doing here?

246
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,380
It must be about the wooden box.

247
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,060
Shao blamed you, and now

248
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,820
Lady Qiao's here to throw her weight around.

249
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,900
I have nothing to say to her.

250
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,660
Tell her I'm ill.

251
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,580
No need for visits

252
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,100
the next few days.

253
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
Yes.

254
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,900
My Lady, please return.

255
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,540
Lady Zhu isn't feeling well

256
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,620
and cannot receive guests.

257
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,700
You don't need to come these days.

258
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Lady Qiao just married in

259
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,140
and already sows discord
between Shao and you.

260
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,660
She even dares to complain to Shao.

261
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,580
Seems Lady Qiao

262
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,940
doesn't fear you at all.

263
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Who knows

264
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,580
what Zhonglin got questioned about by her?

265
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,860
Now he defends her at every turn.

266
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,420
There's no one close to Shao

267
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,900
to help him see right from wrong.

268
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,180
You're right about that.

269
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,260
What a pity.

270
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,980
Zhonglin is still too young.

271
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,220
He can't even tell

272
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,420
who's truly close to him.

273
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,540
Lady Zhu

274
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,760
- looked fine yesterday.
- What's she saying now?

275
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,300
Why is she suddenly sick today?

276
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,380
She must be tired.

277
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,860
She wants some peace. Let her rest.

278
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,340
I think she's just scared of you.

279
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,990
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

280
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,060
You sweep my courtyard all day.

281
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,740
Now Mother's fallen ill.
Shouldn't you be serving her?

282
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,300
I wonder am I allowed

283
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,420
to dismiss you now?

284
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,700
My Lady, what do you mean by this?

285
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,500
You've been spying in my courtyard,

286
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
but you didn't even know Mother's ill?

287
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

288
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,580
My Lady,

289
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,940
that's impressive.

290
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,500
No one's eavesdropping now.

291
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
I dismissed them

292
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,620
so you can rant all you want.

293
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,420
I'll be careful with my words. I swear.

294
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,260
My Lord, are you eating now?

295
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,380
You had this prepared before I even asked?

296
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Her Ladyship arranged it.

297
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,860
It's still warm.

298
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,660
Something wrong with the food?

299
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
No, not at all.

300
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,180
They're all my favorites.

301
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,380
She's always

302
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,940
been thoughtful.

303
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,860
How's the new bedding? Comfortable?

304
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,820
Her Ladyship said if you like it,

305
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,860
she'll prepare thicker ones

306
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,140
when the weather turns cold.

307
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,820
Her Ladyship also said

308
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,860
she's mastered

309
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,960
Lady Zhu's stitching technique

310
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,820
and returned them.

311
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,860
Hope they're comfortable.

312
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,580
By the way, someone said

313
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,980
Lady Zhu isn't feeling well

314
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,340
and asked you to visit her.

315
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,500
Alright.

316
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
I'll eat later.

317
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,500
I'll go now.

318
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,980
Zhonglin,

319
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,980
last time

320
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,060
was all my fault.

321
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,100
Will you forgive me, son?

322
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,780
Of course I will.

323
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
I just want you to know,

324
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,580
only your wife

325
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,420
walks with you to the end.

326
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,820
Though she's not your blood,

327
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,900
she's your closest companion and true love.

328
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,220
My closest companion

329
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,540
and true love.

330
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,460
Yes, that's right.

331
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,100
But sadly,

332
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,900
you married Lady Qiao.

333
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,420
She doesn't care about you.

334
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm afraid

335
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,460
she doesn't even know

336
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,900
what you like, what you eat,

337
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,860
or your shoe size.

338
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,900
These two...

339
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,860
My Lord?

340
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,380
Sir,

341
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,220
there's something

342
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,900
I'd like to ask you.

343
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,420
Please, go ahead.

344
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,500
Sir,

345
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,300
may I ask you, what is a closest

346
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,740
companion and true love really like?

347
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,100
A closest companion and true love?

348
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,140
My Lord, think carefully about this.

349
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
Is Lady Xu

350
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,260
your closest companion

351
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,820
and true love?

352
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,220
She helped you become the family head,

353
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,820
took over the late lord's duties,

354
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,140
and kept the household in order for decades.

355
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,500
Grandmother

356
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,100
is indeed close to me.

357
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,540
She places

358
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,100
her expectations on me.

359
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,820
With expectations

360
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,420
come obligations.

361
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,900
So, what I feel for her

362
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,940
is love,

363
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,460
the respectful kind.

364
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,380
What about Lady Zhu?

365
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,780
My mother?

366
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm dutiful to her.

367
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,500
My Lord, do you think I,

368
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
your advisor, am that person?

369
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,980
Sir, to me,

370
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,580
you're like a teacher,

371
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,420
and a father.

372
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,420
What I feel

373
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,460
for you

374
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,220
is trust.

375
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,180
If I truly saw you

376
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,820
as my closest companion and true love...

377
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,820
That'd be too much pressure.

378
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
What about those generals?

379
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
They've fought beside you.

380
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,460
Are they your closest companions?
Do you love them?

381
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,940
True.

382
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,940
They've fought with me

383
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,580
for years.

384
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,540
In my eyes,

385
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,740
they're like my brothers.

386
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,620
I hope that someday, the war will end,

387
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,060
and they can live in peace.

388
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,740
In time,

389
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,020
they'll have lives of their own.

390
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,700
They can go their own way.

391
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,340
If they wish to leave,

392
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
I won't stop them.

393
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
My Lord,

394
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,300
you've turned everyone away.

395
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,100
I believe, deep down,

396
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,660
you already have an answer.

397
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,460
I truly don't.

398
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,580
That's why I ask, sir.

399
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
My Lord, please look.

400
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,460
(Closest)

401
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,940
The left side of

402
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,060
the character "Qin"
[*Closest]

403
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,260
means blood,

404
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,340
while the right side

405
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,260
means "to see".

406
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,220
So the one closest to you

407
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,460
should be someone

408
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,940
who sees what you see,

409
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,060
and feels what you feel.

410
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,020
(Love)

411
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,460
Now, look at "Ai".
[*Love]

412
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,820
It combines

413
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,460
endurance, devotion,

414
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,060
and friendship.

415
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,780
This person

416
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,860
must be patient with you,

417
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,900
willing to care,

418
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,940
not fear you,

419
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,260
and share

420
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,700
mutual respect and fondness.

421
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,300
Things you don't want to tell others,

422
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,620
you can tell her.

423
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,420
Matters you don't want others to handle,

424
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,900
you can leave to her.

425
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,500
And you can show

426
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,100
your vulnerability to her.

427
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,740
I think Lady of Wei

428
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,020
is wise and gentle.

429
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,980
She's got some impressive qualities.

430
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,060
Please stop bringing her up, sir.

431
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,260
She's sharp-tongued,

432
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,460
not gentle at all.

433
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,820
You wrongly accused her
of reading the military intel,

434
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,860
yet she defended herself

435
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,380
without fear.

436
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,460
That means Her Ladyship trusts you

437
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,020
and feels she can confide in you.

438
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,140
Have you forgotten

439
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,660
how persistent she was back then?

440
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,460
And in daily life?

441
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,500
Hasn't Lady of Wei cared for you?

442
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,980
Despite your authority,

443
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,940
has Lady of Wei

444
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,980
ever shown fear?

445
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,300
Come on, Advisor.

446
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,060
Give it a rest. Stop bringing her up.

447
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,500
We married for political reasons.

448
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,540
How could she be...

449
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,740
my closest companion and true love?

450
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,540
(Love)

451
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,860
(Love)

452
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,660
Her Ladyship hasn't gone to bed?

453
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,100
She's copying sutras for Lady Xu.

454
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,220
Lady Xu loves The Infinite Life Sutra
she copied.

455
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,300
Would you like to go in?

456
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,740
No.

457
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
Have the kitchen

458
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,780
prepare ginseng soup for her.

459
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,220
Yes.

460
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,420
(Wei Mansion)

461
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,940
You didn't go to
Government Office today, My Lord?

462
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,460
I'll head over soon.

463
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,820
Are you going to visit Grandmother?

464
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,980
Yes.

465
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,860
I'll go with you.

466
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,700
- Tan?
- Yes, My Lord.

467
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
I'm hungry.

468
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,460
I'll have the kitchen prepare food now.

469
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,100
Tell Her Ladyship to prepare it

470
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,660
and bring it to me herself.

471
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,540
♪Fate walks with me, still I feign no care♪

472
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,820
My Lady.

473
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,260
Take these in to His Lordship.

474
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,380
See if he likes them.

475
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,220
Yes.

476
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,820
Her Ladyship sent over these dim sum.

477
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,620
She wants to know if they suit your taste.

478
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,660
Where is she?

479
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,780
At the door.

480
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,900
Why isn't she coming in?

481
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,500
I forgot to ask. Please wait.

482
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,460
Tell him he's busy with state affairs.

483
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't want to disturb him.

484
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,140
Yes.

485
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,620
My Lord,

486
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,180
she says she doesn't want to

487
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,100
bother you with work.

488
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,500
Go tell her,

489
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,020
if something's wrong
with the dim sum, I'd like to

490
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,820
speak to her in person. Let her in.

491
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,660
Yes.

492
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,340
My Lady,

493
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,500
he says if he doesn't like them, he wants

494
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,420
to tell you in person.

495
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,260
Please go in.

496
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,180
But how could he not like them?

497
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,660
The kitchen made them just the way he likes.

498
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,980
My Lord, Her Ladyship said

499
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,020
they were made the way you like.

500
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,700
No way you don't like them.

501
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,620
Then why does she want to know
if I like them?

502
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Putting on a show, huh?

503
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,420
You...

504
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,740
Tell her to come in.

505
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,100
I want to talk to her.

506
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,980
I wouldn't dare go in.

507
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,580
Who knows what mood he's in today?

508
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,260
What if I upset him

509
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,860
or offend him?

510
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,260
Tan.

511
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,060
I'm hungry.

512
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,170
My Lord, Her Ladyship

513
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,660
sent dim sum this afternoon.

514
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,660
You haven't had any yet.

515
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,300
Tell her to make me a fresh late-night snack.

516
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
And

517
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,020
bring it herself.

518
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,020
Yes.

519
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,860
What's wrong with him?

520
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,100
Isn't he just picking on me on purpose?

521
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,940
Why eat so late at night?

522
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,940
Xiaozao, go to the kitchen.

523
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,900
Grab anything for him.

524
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,940
Just take it over.

525
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,780
Yes.

526
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,220
He's sent for me twice today.

527
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,700
Could he have found out about Boya?

528
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
No way.

529
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,020
I've cleaned the bamboo slips

530
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,300
you drafted secretly.

531
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,180
And I've put away

532
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,620
the Map of Boya you drew.

533
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,180
How could he have found out?

534
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,940
You take this in to him.

535
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,220
My Lady, please don't make it hard for me.

536
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,700
Tan.

537
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,780
My Lady.

538
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,500
I've brought the food.

539
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,660
You take it in to him.

540
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,940
Please don't make it hard for me.

541
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,060
So, neither of you will go?

542
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,820
I'll just leave it here.

543
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,620
Please call him out to get it.

544
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,220
Sorry, I've offended you again.

545
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,140
Please punish me.

546
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,460
You didn't offend me.

547
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,900
Didn't you say I should come get it?

548
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,820
Here I am.

549
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,180
Why have you been avoiding me?

550
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,660
I'm not avoiding you.

551
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,380
If something's bothering you,

552
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,260
just tell me.

553
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,220
Thank you for your concern.

554
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,180
This is for you.

555
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,340
My Lady,

556
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,260
I heard from Tan.

557
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,340
This is a rare armrest.

558
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,900
Did His Lordship see
the ink stain on your hands

559
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,940
and gift this for your writing?

560
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,780
He asked if his mother troubled me.

561
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,860
Maybe he feels guilty about that day

562
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,540
and wants to make peace.

563
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,860
Well, His Lordship does seem reasonable.

564
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,180
If he really feels guilty,

565
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,860
I have an idea.

566
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
But it'll cost me a bit of silver.

567
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,620
Isn't that easy?

568
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
Here.

569
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,700
I have plenty.

570
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,380
And I have more.

571
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,260
Where did you get so much?

572
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,260
Half the street out there
belongs to Qiao now.

573
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,500
Don't worry, My Lady.

574
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,700
You'll never run short of silver.

575
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,140
No wonder you're always out and about.

576
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,100
What are we buying?

577
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,060
A zither.

578
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,860
Why do we need a zither?

579
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,340
I miss Cousin.

580
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,780
No problem.

581
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,820
How much are we spending?

582
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,900
As long as it plays, it's fine.

583
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,700
Well...

584
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,660
Alright.

585
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,660
Her Ladyship is waiting for you to eat.

586
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,740
What's going on here?

587
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,420
My Lord.

588
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,220
What's this?

589
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,100
I'm not a good player.

590
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,660
Sorry you had to see that.

591
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah, you're not.

592
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,500
From now on,

593
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,940
I'll practice every day.

594
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,580
I don't think that's necessary.

595
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,860
Let's eat.

596
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,500
Let's eat.

597
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,740
Why are you crying?

598
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,620
I told you,

599
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,380
if something's bothering you, just tell me.

600
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,540
Go on.

601
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,940
What's wrong?

602
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,900
It's...

603
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,700
It's Cousin.

604
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,580
She's skilled at playing the konghou.

605
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,460
Before she left,

606
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,620
she gave me this instrument.

607
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,580
While unpacking the things I brought

608
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,980
back from Yanzhou, I saw it again

609
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,260
and couldn't help missing her.

610
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,380
Cousin's kindness is still
so clear in my mind.

611
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
You're quite close

612
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,540
with your cousin.

613
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,660
Yes.

614
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,740
She wrote to me.

615
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,620
Since she eloped with Bi Zhi,

616
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,980
they're living a hard life now,

617
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,420
while I'm here enjoying

618
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,620
comfort and luxury.

619
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,420
I feel terrible about it.

620
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,180
That's not so hard to fix.

621
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,260
Just send her some supplies.

622
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,380
Help her make things easier.

623
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,460
But who would do that?

624
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,380
She eloped.

625
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,660
Even my uncle disowned her.

626
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,420
Don't worry, I'll have someone do it.

627
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,900
Really?

628
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,420
Yeah.

629
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,220
Where is she now?

630
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,220
She's in...

631
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Boya.

632
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,900
Boya?

633
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
My Lord,

634
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,060
do you think it's too far?

635
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,420
I was just wondering

636
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,820
why are they in Boya?

637
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,420
Cousin and Bi Zhi

638
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,620
don't have any papers
to prove their identity.

639
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,900
They can't enter any proper city.

640
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,180
So they must be staying

641
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,060
somewhere remote,
outside of authority's reach,

642
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,900
just to survive.

643
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,500
My Lord,

644
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,580
do you still stand by your word?

645
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,820
Of course I do.

646
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,100
Here's the thing.

647
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,980
Pack up whatever you

648
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,060
want to send her. I'll have

649
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,980
someone deliver it.

650
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,780
Alright.

651
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,820
I have no way to thank you,

652
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,220
but I'll practice konghou every day,

653
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,100
until I'm good enough to play for you.

654
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,660
That's really not necessary.

655
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,100
It's not your thing.

656
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,580
Eating is. Dig in.

657
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,220
Want me to play it again?

658
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,060
No need.

659
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
Just eat.

660
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,820
Why are we delivering things

661
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,180
for Her Ladyship's cousin?

662
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,380
My Lord,

663
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,460
don't let beauty cloud your judgment.

664
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,380
It's a waste of talent.

665
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,820
That's right, My Lord.

666
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,180
This trip may seem like

667
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,540
a supply run.

668
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,380
But since we don't know much about

669
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,660
the Commander of Boya Forces,

670
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,860
it's the perfect opportunity

671
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,180
to scout him out.

672
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,420
Smart move, My Lord.

673
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,020
Alright, you go ahead and decide

674
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,940
who will go then.

675
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,940
Come on, let's draw straws.

676
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,140
Drawing straws again?

677
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,660
I never win at this.

678
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,180
Are you setting me up?

679
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,380
Don't think so low of me.

680
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,240
- Get lost.
- Here,

681
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,120
put it in your hand.

682
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,420
I'll draw from you, fair enough?

683
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,740
Draw.

684
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,700
Looks like this tough task

685
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
falls on me in the end.

686
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,460
Better than you thinking I cheated.

687
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,380
This trip isn't for battle,

688
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,740
just for scouting.

689
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,180
What a show.

690
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,020
It's even grander than your wedding parade.

691
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,940
I still think it's not enough.

692
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,020
More people means better support for Cousin.

693
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,940
When you get there,

694
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,340
keep it discreet.

695
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,380
We don't want rumors

696
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,940
of Wei attacking Boya.

697
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,740
Rest assured, My Lord. I understand.

698
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,220
Take care of yourself.

699
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,060
Don't worry.

700
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,860
My Lord, you prepared so much for Cousin.

701
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
It's just to put you at ease.

702
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,660
So you won't be sad again.

703
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,780
These are rice seeds I brought for Cousin.

704
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,820
Even if they're drifting around,

705
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,380
they can survive by farming.

706
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,820
Please be sure to give these rice seeds

707
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,820
to Cousin.

708
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,940
Don't worry.

709
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,460
I saw you brought many servants.

710
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,940
If Cousin needs help,

711
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,180
please let them lend a hand.

712
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,420
Don't worry, My Lady.

713
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,660
All right, head out.

714
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,500
Okay.

715
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,820
Why is he so eager this time?

716
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,780
He's a good buddy.

717
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,460
Took the tough job himself.

718
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,500
Boya has mountains, beasts,

719
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,540
and local wine.

720
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,780
Not just him,

721
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,860
I'd like to go too.

722
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,860
Alright. Head out.

723
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,860
(Boya)

724
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,260
The terrain in Boya is tricky,

725
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,180
mountains over here, forests over there.

726
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,820
Hang in there, guys.

727
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,740
We're almost there.

728
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,300
Let's see if we can get some meat tonight.

729
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
Give me the bow.

730
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
Hyah!

731
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
Whoa.

732
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,550
Who are you?

733
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
I hit this boar.

734
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,580
Why are you taking it?

735
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,540
It was my arrow that hit it.

736
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,660
How is it yours?

737
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,940
You bandit,

738
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,260
quite impressive, huh?

739
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,820
If you want it,

740
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,260
I'll give it to you.

741
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,580
Boars are hard to find.

742
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,980
You'd just give it up?

743
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,300
If you need some meat,

744
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,660
just take it.

745
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,300
I'll hunt another one.

746
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
May I ask, hero,

747
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,180
what is your name?

748
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,420
I'm Bi Zhi.

749
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,460
One green eye, one black eye.

750
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,460
Bi Zhi,

751
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,700
I'm Wei Qu from Wei State.

752
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,020
We're here for you.

753
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,740
General Wei.

754
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,780
Miss.

755
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,940
Lord of Wei sent you here?

756
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,220
Her Ladyship misses you deeply.

757
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,420
His Lordship is worried about her.

758
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
So they sent us here

759
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,700
- with supplies.
- Thank you.

760
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,700
Thank you.

761
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,780
Wei Qu.

762
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,780
General Bi Zhi.

763
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,100
You brought us so many things.

764
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,180
Here, have some water.

765
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,020
General Bi Zhi,

766
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,460
back in Yujun

767
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,220
I heard stories of your bravery.

768
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,340
Who would've thought
the Commander of Boya Forces

769
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,540
is family?

770
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,740
You flatter me.

771
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,580
Cousin,

772
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,700
reading this letter is seeing me.

773
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,460
Xue Tai's crisis can be eased by others.

774
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,340
Bianzhou is far, surrounded
by rugged mountains.

775
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,940
Xue Tai's troops are exhausted

776
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,420
and fear being outnumbered.

777
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,100
Cousin, have Bi Zhi position
Lord of Wei troops

778
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
on high ground

779
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,140
and create the illusion of a large troop.

780
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,180
Victory shall be ours without a fight.

781
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,540
Raise the Qiao family flag

782
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
and take Boya.

783
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
This will keep
the Wei family at bay for years.

784
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,740
The fate of Yanzhou depends on this.

785
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,140
We must give it our all.

786
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,660
Manman.

787
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,090
Put it over there.

788
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,140
Be quick!

789
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
Alright.

790
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,270
Careful there.

791
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,230
Put it over there.

792
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,820
Report!

793
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,900
General, a group of

794
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,960
over 100 men,

795
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,820
escorting 20 carts, has arrived in Boya.

796
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,460
They linked up with the green-eyed bandit.

797
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,860
Locals say

798
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,900
they came from

799
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,340
Yujun, Wei State.

800
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,260
Wei State?

801
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,020
Civilians or soldiers?

802
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,260
Word is, Lady Qiao's sister

803
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,740
is delivering supplies from Yujun.

804
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,740
But she's married to Wei Shao, Lord of Wei.

805
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,460
Hard to tell if they're

806
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,460
civilians or soldiers.

807
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,620
Wei Shao has

808
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,260
already taken Panyi.

809
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,020
Now he wants Boya too?

810
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,460
Scout again and report.

811
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,420
Yes.

812
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,260
Didn't you say His Lordship
doesn't suit the fabric?

813
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,820
Why do you change your mind

814
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,140
and pick fabric again?

815
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,300
He says he has headaches.

816
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,140
Maybe it's the pillow.

817
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,180
I'm picking something softer.

818
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,620
These fabrics are fine,

819
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,780
but not comfortable to the touch.

820
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,740
My Lady,

821
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,420
this is fine fabric from Lady Ding

822
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,980
in Yanzhou.

823
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,540
You wouldn't use them yourself,

824
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,020
but you want to make
something for His Lordship.

825
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,460
He's sent so many things to Cousin.

826
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,340
Of course, I must return the gesture.

827
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,020
Very good, My Lady.

828
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,410
My Lady,

829
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,140
please choose a fabric.

830
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Let me feel them.

831
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,900
How about this one?

832
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,340
It's too stiff.

833
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,420
Try this one.

834
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,460
This one's much softer.

835
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,820
Let's go with this one.

836
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,900
Alright, we'll use this fabric.

837
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,180
My Lord,

838
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,020
General Wei Qu has sent word.

839
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,620
He's arrived at the borders of Boya

840
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,820
and met the Commander of Boya Forces.

841
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,020
So soon?

842
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,860
So, who is this Commander of Boya Forces?

843
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,020
He's your brother-in-law,

844
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,220
Bi Zhi.

845
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,460
It's him?

846
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,380
That's interesting.

847
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,060
No one pays much heed to Boya.

848
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,340
Now it's under Bi Zhi's control.

849
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,660
He's both Qiao Yue's son-in-law

850
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,220
and your brother-in-law.

851
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,980
Whose side he picks

852
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,780
will decide whether Boya belongs to

853
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,420
Qiao or Wei.

854
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,300
Please, sir, speak your mind.

855
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,260
General Wei Qu went

856
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,060
at Her Ladyship's request.

857
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,620
What exactly did she

858
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,740
mean by that?

859
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,780
What meaning could there be?

860
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,820
If Her Ladyship knew Bi Zhi

861
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,220
was the Commander of Boya Forces,

862
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,540
she would've told me.

863
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,940
Don't worry,

864
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,220
she wouldn't hide it.

865
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,540
You're home early today.

866
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,540
(Wise Kashyapa Who Governs Eternally)

867
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,380
I am.

868
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,620
To congratulate you.

869
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,700
Why is that?

870
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,100
Do you know

871
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,540
who the Commander of Boya Forces is?

872
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,900
Who is it?

873
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
Your brother-in-law.

874
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,860
Bi Zhi.

875
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,060
You must be joking, My Lord.

876
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,620
My brother-in-law is just a stableman.
