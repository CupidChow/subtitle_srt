1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and your kindness

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and your kindness

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and your kindness

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and your kindness

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and your kindness

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your kindness

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your kindness

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and your kindness

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and your kindness

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and your kindness

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and your kindness

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and your kindness

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and your kindness

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and your kindness

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and your kindness

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your kindness

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and your kindness

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and your kindness

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You two, I advise you to stop

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know when in Yan State

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it's the turn of a Liangya person to make the decision

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All soldiers should know

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your Zhou Mu

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
has been killed by the King of Liangya in Pan Yi

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Liangya people are keeping the news

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to divide Yan State in the future

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Brother is dead

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now Qiao Yue is dead

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Zhou Mu

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is naturally the king's successor

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are sure

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to be like him

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I promise you

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will take the throne

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The King of Liangya will reward you

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The army of Wei State will immediately settle Pan Yi

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can't protect yourself

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not to mention you

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Brothers, think carefully

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You want to listen to a Liangya person

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
or your own army

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Soldiers

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My brother

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
has been confused for a long time

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and made Yan State

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so close

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you don't give up

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will not

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
betray my trust

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is Zhou Mu really dead?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I heard it too

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Actually, even if he is not dead

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I support the king

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The stubbornness is what the people want

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I support the stubbornness

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, you are right

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you going to rebel?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Take down the Liangya

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Give me the order

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yan State

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
will no longer cooperate with Liangya

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Give the order to the company

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to gather all the troops

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and subdue Pan Yi

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
General Weiliang

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Prepare a good official

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What can I do?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am willing to give up

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't want to lose

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't want to lose

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't want to lose

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't want to lose

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't act rashly

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The bridge is in our hands

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Without the pen

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yan State is not enough to go

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Not to mention

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I still have a big gift

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
for Wei Shao

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Kill

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Majesty

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Your Majesty is really not enough

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Give me half a month

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
General is really a general

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You lead the Zhou army

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will attack the city

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Liu Xiaofu is very smart

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will keep the strength

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Although the army is few

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But each of them is brave and good at fighting

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This battle is very good

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What about their bravery?

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Still want to lose

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
General doesn't know

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is more pleasant

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wei Shao was trapped in Yongning City for several days

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The army was reduced

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Two days ago

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But he went with the remaining soldiers

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to Pan Yi

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wei Shao really gave up on the army for Pan Yi

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Guess

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you know Wei Shao's whereabouts

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
before the two armies are in battle

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What should he do?

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The South Army is not angry with us

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but did what the Marquis should do

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Zhong Lin has his mission

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yu Jun is on our side

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But now not only Yu Jun is trapped

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The war between Pan Yi and the army is very dangerous

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If I can help the South Army

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to hold on for a few days

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and keep some soldiers

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can help him to take Pan Yi

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The world will be peaceful

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But Yu Jun has already been in the army

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm afraid he can't hold on for a few days

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Great Madam

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How's the battle?

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
General Wei and General Qiao Si

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
guarded the gates of the three cities

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But Xue Tai's army is too strong

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and there are no soldiers in the city

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm afraid he can't hold on for too long

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What should we do?

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Who said there were no soldiers in the city?

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's enjoy the festival

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Come on

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Enjoy the festival

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,020
I don't want to

149
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
overheat your concern for the Wei family

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Don't mention the rest

151
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,640
foi

152
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
I will follow you as soon as possible

153
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
and only listen to you

154
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Only listen to you

155
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
and only listen to you

156
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Grandma Bai

157
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Shiyuan is back

158
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Shiyuan

159
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Shiyuan

160
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Shiyuan

161
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Shiyuan is back

162
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Madam Wei

163
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Today, Wei and Bianzhou

164
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
should be together

165
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
because of the marriage

166
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Now, Yu Jun is in trouble

167
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Please go out of the city with us

168
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
and guard Yu Jun together

169
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Okay

170
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Okay, I'll give you the army horse

171
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Shiyuan, you deserve to be

172
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
the blood of my family

173
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
This is...

174
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
They are

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
the Bianzhou soldiers

176
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
who came with me to support Yu Jun

177
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
They are Chen Pang's men?

178
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Yes

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
They are anxious to support Yu Jun

180
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
They didn't think about it

181
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
If grandma Bai cares about their reputation

182
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
I will let them invade

183
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Shiyuan

184
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Bianzhou and Weiguo have old grudges

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
It's just

186
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
my personal grudge with Chen Pang

187
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Today, you can

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
follow my grandson Shiyuan

189
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
and risk your lives

190
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
to support Yu Jun

191
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
You are my benefactors

192
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I thank you

193
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
We will follow you

194
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
and do our best

195
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
to do whatever you want

196
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Please get up

197
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Get up, everyone

198
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Grandma Bai

199
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Shiyuan is gone

200
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Shiyuan is gone

201
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Be careful

202
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I hope they can come back safely

203
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
There is no more conflict

204
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
When the army wins

205
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
what grandma said will come true

206
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Go

207
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Go

208
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Do we have to fight like this?

209
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Marquis Wei treats me like his family

210
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
But I can only do my best

211
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Because my wife is trapped

212
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
in the family

213
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Li Jun

214
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Why?

215
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Marquis Wei, don't be so affectionate

216
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Just do it

217
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Bi Zhi

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
What are you waiting for?

219
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Do it

220
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Bi Zhi

221
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Bi Zhi

222
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Wait

223
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Bi Zhi, no

224
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Bi Zhi

225
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
is like a pig

226
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
a dog

227
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,360
Look, does she look like a beast?

228
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
She's just listening to people's gossip.

229
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Bi Zhi, if you don't hurt Wei Shao,

230
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,440
I'll hurt your wife.

231
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,120
How can you treat her like this?

232
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,280
We can only treat her like this

233
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,200
because of you.

234
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Let go of me.

235
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Just like you hate others.

236
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,560
She.

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Kill...

238
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:39,280
We must capture sahe and send in the colours to save the convergence of

239
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Thanks

240
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
General Xue is dead.

241
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Run!

242
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
General Xue is dead.

243
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Run!

244
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Run!

245
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Run!

246
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Run!

247
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Run!

248
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Run!

249
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
His eyes are so bright.

250
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
He is really a brave man.

251
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Your Highness.

252
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
If your wisdom has always been useful to you,

253
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
you can believe that the world will soon be

254
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
in your hands.

255
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
You can also believe that

256
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
the world will soon be

257
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
in your hands.

258
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
So what if it works?

259
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I'll accept it.

260
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Yes.

261
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Bi Zhi!

262
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
If you don't accept it,

263
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
I'll cut off your wife's hair!

264
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Bi Zhi!

265
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Bi Zhi!

266
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Don't be influenced by them anymore!

267
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Don't you dare touch me!

268
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Bi Zhi is indeed a brave man.

269
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
If there are a few points in the world,

270
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
he will have a place to attack.

271
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
It's a pity that...

272
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
It's a pity that he has no brains.

273
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You can't say that!

274
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Shut up!

275
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
If you don't attack,

276
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
I'll cut him off!

277
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Attack!

278
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Push him down!

279
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Bi Zhi!

280
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Bi Zhi, stop fighting!

281
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Because no one in this world

282
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
means that we must do something wrong.

283
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I can die for you.

285
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Because you are my favorite sister.

286
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,680
But I can't let Bi Zhi die for you.

287
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
I can't be evil with love.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Let him protect my family.

289
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Even if it's you,

290
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I can't protect you.

291
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
I can't be evil with love.

292
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Can I let him die for me,

293
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
for my family,

294
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,680
or even for me?

295
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
There's only one person I want to protect.

296
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I will never regret it.

297
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Bi Zhi!

298
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
You are my beloved.

299
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
You are not a beast that can be killed by others.

300
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
My husband,

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
in the future,

302
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
if you remember today,

303
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
just remember,

304
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I will never regret it!

305
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Yi Qiu!

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Yi Qiu!

307
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Fan...

308
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Fan...

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
Fan!

310
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Fan!

311
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Fan!

312
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Fan, wake up!

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
I don't want to be a general.

314
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Fan, don't die!

315
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Don't die!

316
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
If you die,

317
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
what about Li Er and I?

318
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
As long as you can come back,

319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I can do anything.

320
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Fan...

321
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Fan!

322
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Fan!

323
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,680
Dad!

324
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Dad!

325
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Dad!

326
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Dad!

327
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Dad!

328
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Dad is not a son!

329
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,680
I thought I could hold on for a while

330
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
but it seems that the truth is still useless

331
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
What about you two working together?

332
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I have thousands of soldiers and horses in the city

333
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
to deal with you

334
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm willing to do it

335
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
The blood is too wet. The blood is too wet.

336
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
Everyone, hurry up and die

337
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Hurry up

338
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Hurry up

339
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Hurry up

340
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Hurry up

341
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
He's coming back

342
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,680
Hurry up

343
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Hold this

344
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Hurry up

345
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
You want to die because of me?

346
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
We have many people

347
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Don't be afraid

348
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Xue Tai is dead

349
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
No one can control him

350
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
We will kill him

351
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
What are you doing?

352
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
What are you doing?

353
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
What are you doing?

354
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
He's really back

355
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
You

356
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Your face

357
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Your face is really back

358
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
It's really back

359
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
You all saw it

360
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Don't try to escape

361
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Don't try to escape

362
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Be careful

363
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Don't move

364
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Madam Li

365
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Why?

366
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Madam Yu Long

367
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
Why?

368
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
You

369
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
See my face

370
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm here to escort you away

371
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Stop

372
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Stop

373
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Liu Yuanyuan knows

374
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I am in this situation

375
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
I know

376
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Madam Yu Long

377
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
In the capital

378
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Your Highness arranged it

379
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
I secretly

380
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
How long can I stay?

381
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Your Highness said

382
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
If this battle is defeated

383
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I will escort you to a safe place

384
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
The doctor has arranged the funeral for you

385
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
You

386
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,680
I will go

387
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Impossible

388
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
You said no one cares about you in this world

389
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
But Zhang Xiong loves you

390
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Impossible

391
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
I love you

392
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
He asked me to take care of you when he died

393
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
That Chen Xiang

394
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Really treats you

395
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,680
For you

396
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
And you are not good for Wushan Palace

397
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Impossible

398
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Liu Yuanyuan is not good to me

399
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
You destroy the good of others

400
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
You are not good to you

401
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Instead of complaining about this world

402
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
You should think about why others care about you

403
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You are not obedient

404
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
He is so talented

405
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Why did you let me die again?

406
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
One month later

407
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Shi Yuan did not obey the order

408
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
This battle

409
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
is won

410
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Won

411
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Good

412
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
I wish Nan Jun won

413
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,800
This is the only way

414
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:47,560
To make a Celine

415
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,220
Hold on to two sides

416
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,620
We can't let them come up here!

417
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
Yes!

418
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,020
Your Highness, Bi Zhi and Wei Shao are already crazy.

419
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,420
It's not safe here. You should retreat to the rear.

420
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,420
What?

421
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,820
You think my army is inferior to Wei Shao?

422
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,420
No, no.

423
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,020
Not to mention that my army has several soldiers inferior to Wei Shao.

424
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,220
Even if it's a direct battle,

425
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,620
I'm not afraid of them.

426
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,420
Your Highness, you're not afraid of them,

427
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,620
but you don't need to be hurt because of them.

428
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,620
If Your Highness didn't send 5,000 imperial guards

429
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,020
and General Liu Xiao to guard the lady,

430
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,420
I wouldn't have to worry so much.

431
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,820
You don't hide that I love my wife.

432
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,420
A woman's love is a matter of life and death.

433
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
I'm listening to you.

434
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Shut up!

435
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,620
I'm a man of the family of my wife.

436
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,020
I must take Wei Shao's life in this battle.

437
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,620
You're a fool!

438
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,420
How can a woman be held captive

439
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,220
when she's the ruler of the world?

440
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,420
Guards!

441
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,020
Yes!

442
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Take His Highness away.

443
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Step aside!

444
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,420
I told you.

445
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Your uncle is dead.

446
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,620
Since you can't recognize your identity,

447
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,220
then you should die.

448
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,420
After killing Wei Shao,

449
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
the world will be mine.

450
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,020
I'm the master of the Central Plains.

451
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,020
I'm the master of the Central Plains.

452
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,540
General Wei, don't be hurry.

453
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,140
Serve Zhai Li well.

454
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,820
Wei Shao, even if you kill me,

455
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,020
Wei State will be trapped in the flood.

456
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,020
You can't defeat me.

457
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,820
You can't defeat me!

458
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
You...

459
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Wei,

460
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,620
I made a wish.

461
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,520
Titled by De linked to the sort

462
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:29,240
Work in attacks of Dak and Chase,

463
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Yes, not bad

464
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Sir

465
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
This is a big one

466
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,640
But the 700-mile-long road

467
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,280
was the length from Pan Yi to Xin Du

468
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,400
Now the route to Rong Jun

469
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,040
is about 2,000 miles long

470
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,880
Not to mention the whole length to all states

471
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
If Marquis Wei is not here

472
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,040
I can make another one

473
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,080
to write the war of Pan Yi

474
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
No need

475
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
These two words are enough

476
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,280
Your father is very good

477
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,840
You can be the superior

478
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,800
But many things

479
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,560
are too urgent

480
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,920
No matter how cruel the war was

481
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,680
what people often remember in their hearts

482
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,200
are beautiful memories

483
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,680
and people they truly love

484
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,280
Marquis Wei is very righteous

485
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,240
We are very happy

486
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,920
Tomorrow, we will follow the route

487
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,080
and follow the state's order

488
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,600
Marquis Wei, please don't refuse

489
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,680
We will follow the state's order

490
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay

491
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,120
I won't let you down

492
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
I will help the people

493
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,560
to get through the crisis

494
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,120
I heard that Chen Pang

495
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,320
didn't get to meet the army until he died

496
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,040
But he died in filial piety

497
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,760
He is really a good man

498
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,560
Shiyuan is the leader of the state

499
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,960
Don't mention these things again

500
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Yes

501
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,320
Grandmother

502
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
Shiyuan

503
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,520
Depart

504
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:50,440
挺

505
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,440
Congratulations, 그래도

506
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:40,220
Breakdown after

507
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,340
Ah Fan, I'll lead a good life with Li Gen.

508
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,380
Don't miss me.

509
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,380
We will remember Fan

510
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,380
and those who have lost

511
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
After you left

512
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
I have never won against those bad guys

513
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,380
Today we brought good wine

514
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Come and see you

515
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,380
Cheers

516
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
Little Tao is here too

517
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
This is the orchid you brought back

518
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,380
I water it every day

519
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
and let it sunbathe

520
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,380
It's growing well now

521
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,380
You are not a good speaker

522
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Look

523
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,380
I brought orchids to tell you

524
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
Whether you live or die

525
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
I am willing to marry you

526
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
Cheers

527
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
In our brotherhood

528
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
these little weapons are equivalent to us

529
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
Although we are not born on the same day

530
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
of the same month

531
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
I guess

532
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
we will not die on the same day

533
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,380
But in the future

534
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
even if the four of us leave

535
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,380
If you bury these weapons together,

536
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
you will always be brothers.

537
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Seeing him

538
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
is like seeing me.

539
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,380
Is this a soldier's salary?

540
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,380
How did you come up with such a bad word?

541
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm just a soldier.

542
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,380
I'm just a soldier.

543
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I'm just a soldier.

544
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
I'm just a soldier.

545
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
I'm just a soldier.

546
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
I'm just a soldier.

547
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
I'm just a soldier.

548
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,380
I'm just a soldier.

549
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,380
I'm just a soldier.

550
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
I'm just a soldier.

551
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
I'm just a soldier.

552
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,380
I'm just a soldier.

553
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,380
I'm just a soldier.

554
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,380
I'm just a soldier.

555
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
I'm just a soldier.

556
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,380
I'm just a soldier.

557
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,380
I'm just a soldier.

558
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Boss.

559
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:35,520
The

560
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
Boss Zao.

561
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Mr.

562
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
Is Mr. Zhu found?

563
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Not at all.

564
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,700
Go to see the Great Madam.

565
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,100
Now only the Great Madam can

566
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
complete the ceremony for the Lord.

567
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,900
Hurry up.

568
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,500
Yes.

569
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,780
Don't cry.

570
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,740
Don't cry.

571
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,620
Don't cry.

572
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,980
Don't cry.

573
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,940
The journey has begun.

574
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,660
The Lord couldn't find the Lord.

575
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,420
So he invited the Great Madam.

576
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
Why are you here?

577
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,740
Feifei has been crying.

578
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,700
I can't go there.

579
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,580
Okay.

580
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Okay.

581
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,380
Come.

582
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,180
Come.

583
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,140
Come to me.

584
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,220
You're so good.

585
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,220
slowly

586
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,740
My grandfather used to make a living

587
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,060
by doing cinco karma ANd in world fantasy.

588
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:55,760
They're both

589
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,460
in the parallel world.

590
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,080
They're two separate worlds,

591
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,180
inch by inch quenched through then exists a border line.

592
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,660
Both parts being united

593
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,460
Luckily, my husband and I have traveled thousands of miles

594
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,660
and still know each other and allow each other.

595
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,780
You have saved me,

596
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
and I have saved you.

597
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:51,580
CEOotional

598
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,780
A few years later,

599
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,380
in Ningxu City, the holy water route is characterized by eight inns,

600
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,580
No fundamental enemies on the surface,

601
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,180
'll soon rain flowers on its path...

602
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:13,180
The Long Ballad

603
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,180
The Long Ballad

604
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:14,180
I have no desire for the future, but only wish for it

605
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:22,180
I once saw the world through the blink of an eye, but it was hard to tell

606
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Like a bird in the wind, I want to live my life to the fullest

607
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:38,180
How can I forget the beautiful scenery in my life?

608
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,180
I'd like to cross the sea of mountains to follow your wind

609
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Waiting for the white-leaved tree to be like the first snow

610
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,180
The night rain in Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows

611
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,180
I'm sad and I'm sad

612
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,180
I'd like to cut off the smile that makes you confused

613
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

614
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,180
No matter how many times I have to go through this life, I only miss you

615
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:16,180
I will never forget you

616
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,180
I'd like to cross the sea of mountains to follow your wind

617
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Waiting for the white-leaved tree to be like the first snow

618
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,180
The night rain in Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows

619
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I'm sad and I'm sad

620
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,180
I'd like to cut off the smile that makes you confused

621
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,180
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

622
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,180
No matter how many times I have to go through this life, I only miss you

623
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,180
I will never forget you

624
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,180
I will never forget you
