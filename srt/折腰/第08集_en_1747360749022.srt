1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm sorry거

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it love that is the only thing that can save me?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel more and more pain when I'm fighting?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary light

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary light

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary light

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary light

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary light

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you are in my arms and not the clouds

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can go through the fog and the wind

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can go through the fog and the wind

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can go through the fog and the wind

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Love gives me the sky and the sea

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
To be your hero

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,480
AUL THERE'S NO USB

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:18,460
Wil maken

18
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,040
sect

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,800
Anyway,

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Nanjun's heart is in the rack

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,580
Show me

22
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,840
Show me

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,980
how to put cat shirt

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Who is she?

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980
That's her.

26
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
If this pretty girl

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
moved the wooden box by herself,

28
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
we wouldn't blame her.

29
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Now this pretty girl

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
has a chance to touch her cousin.

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
She can't even talk.

32
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,980
This wooden box

33
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
has been with Zhong Lin for more than ten years.

34
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
It's very thoughtful.

35
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
The servants in the western house

36
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
don't let it move easily.

37
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Actually, I don't know

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
what's in it.

39
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Could it be

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,980
some rare treasure?

41
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
No matter what it is,

42
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
now the pretty girl

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,980
is angry at her cousin.

44
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,980
If her cousin is angry,

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
he will definitely kick her out.

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,980
Chu Yu,

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
now the only person

48
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
who can help me

49
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
is you.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,980
My son is the father and mother.

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Thanks to my aunt,

52
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,980
I don't have to wander around.

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,980
As long as my aunt is happy,

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,980
I'm willing to help her.

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
Madam.

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Nan Jun is here.

57
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,980
Nan Jun.

58
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Mother.

59
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Why did you come here?

60
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,980
I came here

61
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,980
to ask you something.

62
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,980
Come and sit.

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,980
Zhong Lin.

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
What's up?

65
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
There's a box in my study.

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
The servants know

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,980
that it can't move easily.

68
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,980
But today,

69
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
I found a scratch on it.

70
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
Someone must have

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
tried to knock it down.

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,980
I don't know

73
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
if you know about it.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
Li You Si Lin.

75
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Who is so bold?

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
If I find out,

77
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
I won't forgive him.

78
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
But Zhong Lin,

79
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
have you asked Qiao Nu about this?

80
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
She knows

81
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
the most about what happened in your study.

82
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Mother, you mean

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
it was Qiao Shi who did this?

84
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Mother, you don't believe Qiao Shi.

85
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,980
It's just that

86
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
if Qiao Shi

87
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
is spoiled by you,

88
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
and doesn't take your words

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
seriously,

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,980
you'll be in trouble.

91
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,980
He didn't take your words seriously.

93
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Or he was curious

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
and tried to find out

95
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
your secret.

96
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Mother, you don't know.

97
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
There were some old things

98
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
in the box.

99
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
When I took them out,

100
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
they were empty.

101
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
When Qiao Shi saw

102
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
the wine,

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
he wanted me to take them away.

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
I told him

105
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
to solve the problem.

106
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,980
He got tired of it

107
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
after a few days.

108
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Then he put some gold and silver jewelry in it.

109
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,980
But this happened today.

110
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
I thought

111
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
if someone didn't have a good intention,

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
it means the servants were not clean.

113
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
Mother has been working for years.

114
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
She must know how to deal with it.

115
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
So I came to ask you.

116
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I already know about this.

117
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Don't worry.

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
I'll go check it tomorrow.

119
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Okay.

120
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
I'll leave this to you.

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
I'll leave it to you.

122
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
I hope you can solve it as soon as possible.

123
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
If you're in trouble,

124
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
I'll ask Zhong Ao

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
to help you.

126
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
No need.

127
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Besides,

128
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
I have an idea

129
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
about Zheng Shu.

130
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
You've always wanted him to be with you.

131
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,980
Then I'll choose a handsome man for him

132
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,980
and get him to marry you.

133
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
This way,

134
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
I can solve his life-long problem

135
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
and keep you company for a long time.

136
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
What do you think?

137
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Yes.

138
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Zhong Lin.

139
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,980
You know me well.

140
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
May you

141
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
reconsider with me.

142
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Okay.

143
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,980
You've considered it.

144
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
Tell me.

145
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,980
But don't make it difficult for Qiao Shi.

146
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
After all,

147
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
I'm sure she's the daughter of the Wei State.

148
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,020
Yes.

149
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,020
I have something to do.

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,060
I'll go first.

151
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,020
Mr. Zhang said

152
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,220
he came here specially

153
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,580
to deliver something to the Queen.

154
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,300
This is silk brocade.

155
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,340
It's 200 pieces each.

156
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,860
It's a total of 1,000 pieces.

157
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,940
So many fabrics.

158
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,220
If it's made into a dress,

159
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,980
how long will it last?

160
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,180
Pick some for the King.

161
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,100
The silk brocade is from Yan State.

162
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,540
It's a gift for the Great Madam and Madam.

163
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,180
It's a golden set.

164
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,460
By the way,

165
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,980
these two boxes are the stickers

166
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,220
that Madam Ding prepared for the King.

167
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,700
It's been a long time.

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,420
Why did she send so many things?

169
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,940
The King.

170
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,260
A letter from Yan State.

171
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,140
Where is Zhang Pu?

172
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,580
He's waiting outside.

173
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Sister Zhang asked for help from Yan State.

174
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,980
Why is Uncle so muddled?

175
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,500
He didn't send troops

176
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,460
and he's so rude.

177
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,820
If he misses the chance,

178
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,340
he won't be able to get the Bo Ya.

179
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,420
One day, the King will be angry.

180
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,340
Will he be angry?

181
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,180
What do you mean by one day?

182
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,660
We're at the end of the road.

183
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,300
I thought you've forgotten

184
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,900
the family of Yan State.

185
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,020
When I and Master

186
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,300
were fighting with each other,

187
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,700
I heard that you and the Marquis

188
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,860
were very close.

189
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,620
If you hadn't insisted

190
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,260
on sending the silk brocade to the Marquis,

191
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,700
why would the Marquis

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,740
be so reckless

193
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,500
and not dare to move?

194
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,460
Reckless?

195
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,380
It's already been a month.

196
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,620
There must be a few people coming.

197
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,660
I've been so wronged.

198
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,340
Master wanted to ask the Queen

199
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,580
what the Marquis was doing.

200
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,660
But he didn't expect

201
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,740
the Queen to be deceived.

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,420
He wants to send troops?

203
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,820
Fine.

204
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,180
I'll use his position

205
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,620
to get the Bo Ya to be angry with my family.

206
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,220
I'm afraid the Queen is dreaming.

207
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,340
Let's see if I can do it.

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,100
Your Majesty,

209
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,220
which of these fabrics

210
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,660
is most suitable for the Marquis?

211
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,020
None of them.

212
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,300
He married me

213
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,660
to make these fabrics.

214
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,820
What else does he need?

215
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,540
I'll feed him enough

216
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,820
if I give him more cities.

217
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,620
No.

218
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,620
No matter how many cities I give him,

219
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,660
he won't be full.

220
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,300
Even if he swallows me,

221
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,820
he'll still be thirsty.

222
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,260
I haven't seen the Marquis

223
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,140
be angry for a long time.

224
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,340
He's angry.

225
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,780
I'm not angry.

226
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,860
I just remembered what the Grandfather said to me.

227
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,940
He said he wanted to live a life...

228
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,860
He wanted to fight against the world

229
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,980
and hoped that his allies would be stronger.

230
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,900
He was afraid that he would be too strong

231
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,500
and that he wouldn't be able to suppress his power.

232
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,260
He should blame me.

233
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,300
How could he think of living a life with him?

234
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,860
He only cares about fighting against the world.

235
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,300
This one looks good too.

236
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,940
Look.

237
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,300
Madam,

238
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,220
the Marquis said that he had something to do.

239
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,340
So he didn't come to ask for your help.

240
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,860
The Marquis is here to ask for your help?

241
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
What is he doing here?

242
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,660
It must be about the wooden box.

243
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,180
My cousin was ignored by him.

244
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,460
This Qiao Yu

245
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,060
is eager to show off.

246
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,100
I have nothing to talk to him.

247
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,860
Tell him that I'm sick.

248
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,820
He doesn't have to

249
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,340
ask for my help these days.

250
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes.

251
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,300
Please go back, Your Majesty.

252
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,900
Madam is not feeling well.

253
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,100
It's not convenient for her to see anyone.

254
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,340
She doesn't need to come these days.

255
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
Qiao Yu just came in.

256
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,500
She made my cousin and aunt feel guilty.

257
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,180
She dared to complain to my cousin.

258
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,100
It seems that Qiao Yu

259
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,540
is not afraid of you at all.

260
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,540
You are right.

261
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,500
She is not afraid of you.

262
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,340
I don't know

263
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,020
what Zhong Lin was questioned about.

264
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,140
She is always talking to him.

265
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,780
My cousin doesn't have a substitute

266
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,300
to help him.

267
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,580
You are right.

268
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,380
It's a pity that Zhong Lin is too young.

269
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,620
He doesn't know

270
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,780
what kind of person his substitute is.

271
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,780
Mrs. Zhu

272
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,860
was pregnant yesterday.

273
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,460
Why is she suddenly sick today?

274
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,540
She must be upset.

275
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
She wants to let her rest.

276
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,340
I think she is afraid of the Queen.

277
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,180
Queen.

278
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,020
You are cleaning the yard here all day long.

279
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,740
Madam is sick and doesn't go to serve you.

280
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,340
I don't know if I, the Queen,

281
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,420
can walk away with you.

282
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,980
What do you mean?

283
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,380
You are always asking me about news.

284
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,020
You don't know that Madam is sick?

285
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,340
Yes.

286
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,420
Ning Xue.

287
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,740
You are amazing.

288
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,300
No one will listen to you anymore.

289
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,980
I will let you out of the dark

290
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,340
if I don't let anyone know.

291
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,420
I will pay attention to what I say.

292
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,580
I want to eat.

293
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,900
I haven't ordered yet.

294
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,780
I'm ready.

295
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,300
It's arranged by the Queen.

296
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,260
It's still warm.

297
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,180
Is there any problem with the dishes?

298
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,420
No.

299
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,540
They are all my favorite dishes.

300
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,020
She treats me

301
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,780
so well.

302
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,700
The new cup is comfortable.

303
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,620
The Queen said if the King is satisfied,

304
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,660
he will prepare a thicker cup

305
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,020
when the weather gets cooler.

306
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,420
And this is a letter.

307
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,700
The Queen said

308
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,860
she has learned the skill of Madam.

309
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,580
She will return it to you.

310
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,700
You can send it to her.

311
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,300
By the way,

312
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,660
someone just came to say

313
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,180
Madam is sick.

314
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,460
Please go and visit her.

315
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,460
Okay.

316
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,540
I will try it when I come back.

317
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,660
I will go in first.

318
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,140
Zhuo Lin.

319
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
Last time,

320
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,300
it was all my fault.

321
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,260
Please forgive me.

322
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,860
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,740
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,420
Yes, you are.

327
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,380
Of course.

328
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,260
I just want you to know

329
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,300
that the person on your side

330
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
becomes the one we have to respond to

331
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,940
despite of your identity,

332
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,260
your duck of affection and affection.

333
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,220
Duck of affection and affection?

334
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,060
Yes.

335
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,260
But it's a pity that

336
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,780
you married Qiao Shi.

337
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
I'm afraid he won't be able to care about you.

338
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,780
I'm afraid he doesn't even know

339
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,780
what you like, what you like,

340
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
and how big your shoes are.

341
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
Episode 2

342
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
These two people...

343
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Master?

344
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Sir.

345
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
I have something to ask you.

346
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
It's okay.

347
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,780
I want to ask you

348
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
who is your most beloved?

349
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,780
My most beloved?

350
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Master, think about it.

351
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,780
Is Great Madam your most beloved?

352
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,780
She secretly helped you become the master

353
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,780
and took on the responsibility of the old Marquis of Wei

354
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
to take care of the entire Wei family.

355
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,780
Grandmother is my closest relative.

356
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,780
But she has more expectations of me.

357
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,780
If she has expectations, she must repay them.

358
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,780
So I should treat her more like

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
a close relative.

360
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
What about you?

361
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,780
I'm filial to my mother.

362
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,780
Then you're thinking about me as a military man?

363
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,780
To me, you're like a teacher and a father.

364
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,780
I have more faith in you.

365
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
If I really treat you as my most beloved...

366
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Then I'll be under a lot of pressure.

367
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
What about General Wei Liang?

368
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,780
Are they your most beloved?

369
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Yes.

370
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Yes.

371
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,780
They've been my sons for many years.

372
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,780
In my heart, they're like my brothers.

373
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,780
I also hope that one day they can be at peace

374
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
and they won't have to live on the knife.

375
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
In the future, they'll have their own lives

376
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,780
and their own freedom.

377
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,780
If they want to leave, I won't stop them.

378
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,780
Master.

379
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,780
You've denied it one by one.

380
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,780
I think you have an answer in your heart.

381
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
I really don't know.

382
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
That's why I asked you.

383
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
Master, please have a look.

384
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
The word, kinship,

385
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,780
is not only related to blood kinship on the left,

386
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
but also to the word, see.

387
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
So the person you're thinking about

388
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,780
is the person who sees what you see and thinks what you think.

389
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
Look at the word, love.

390
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,780
Look at the word, love.

391
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,780
It includes the word, endure,

392
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
and love.

393
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
This person

394
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,780
first of all has to be inclusive of the master.

395
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
He has to be willing to spend his life and death

396
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
and at the same time, he's not afraid of you.

397
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
He's in a relationship with you that is close to each other.

398
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,780
If you don't want to tell others, you can tell him.

399
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
If you don't want to leave it to others, you can leave it to him.

400
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,780
If you don't want to let others see you, you're not afraid to be seen by him.

401
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,780
I think the female army is virtuous and smart.

402
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
It's a good thing.

403
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Don't mention him, okay?

404
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
He has a sharp history.

405
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
How can he be virtuous?

406
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,780
That's because the master misunderstood him and peeked at the military report.

407
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
But the female army is not afraid to defend herself.

408
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,780
This means that the female army also treats you as a friend.

409
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,780
She's a very kind and kind person.

410
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Then you forgot

411
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
how she was at the time.

412
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,780
How about living?

413
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
Did the female army love you?

414
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,780
And you're so strict.

415
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Did the female army fear you?

416
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
But the military counselor, don't mention him again.

417
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,780
My marriage with him is just a matter of situation.

418
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,780
How can it be a person who only loves himself?

419
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
The female army is still awake.

420
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
Maybe they're reading the gold for the Great Madam.

421
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
The Great Madam is satisfied with the letter

422
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
written by the female army.

423
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
The male army is going in.

424
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
No.

425
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Tell the kitchen to prepare a bowl of ginseng soup for him.

426
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I'll go in.

427
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
I'll go in.

428
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
I'll go in.

429
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
I'll go in.

430
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
I'll go in.

431
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I'll go in.

432
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Yes.

433
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
Did the male army go to Yashu today?

434
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
I'll go in a while.

435
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Are you going to visit your grandmother?

436
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Yes.

437
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Let's go together.

438
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Go.

439
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Go.

440
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,780
The Great Madam's Residence

441
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Tang.

442
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
Yes.

443
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
I'm hungry.

444
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare food.

445
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Tell the female army to prepare.

446
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,780
And ask her to send it to me in person.

447
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
The female army is waiting for you.

448
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
The female army.

449
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Take it in and give it a try.

450
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Yes.

451
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
The female army sent it to me.

452
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,780
Let me see if it's good.

453
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Where is she?

454
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
At the door.

455
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Why don't you come in?

456
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
I'll ask.

457
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
Wait a minute.

458
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
You just said she was handling business.

459
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
I can't bother you.

460
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Yes.

461
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
The female army said you were handling business.

462
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
It's not convenient to disturb.

463
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
You told her

464
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,780
that there was something wrong with the dessert.

465
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
I told her in person.

466
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
She came in.

467
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
The female army.

468
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
The female army said if the dessert was not to your liking,

469
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,780
I would tell you in person to let you in.

470
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,780
How could it be not to my liking?

471
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,780
That's what the kitchen does according to her likes.

472
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,780
The female army.

473
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,780
The female army said it's all done according to your likes.

474
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
It won't be to my liking.

475
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,780
Then ask me if it's to my liking.

476
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
I'm just pretending.

477
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
You...

478
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,780
Let her in.

479
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,780
I have something to tell her.

480
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,780
I dare not go in.

481
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
Who knows if she's in a good mood today.

482
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
If I upset her and bump into her,

483
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
what will happen?

484
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
What should I do?

485
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Xiao Tao.

486
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
I'm hungry.

487
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
Dan Jun.

488
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
The dessert the female army prepared for you this afternoon,

489
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
you haven't eaten yet?

490
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Let her make me another night snack.

491
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
And

492
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
let her bring it back in person.

493
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Yes.

494
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
What's wrong with her?

495
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
Isn't she looking for me on purpose?

496
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
It's so late.

497
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
What night snack should we eat?

498
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Xiao Tao, go to the kitchen.

499
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Just ask her to bring two things over.

500
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Yes.

501
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,780
She asked me to come here twice a day.

502
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Does she know about the mint?

503
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
No way.

504
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
I've cleaned all the bamboo slices you secretly picked.

505
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
I've also cleaned up the mint fish pictures

506
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
and put them away.

507
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
How did she find out?

508
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
Bring it in for her.

509
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
Don't make things difficult for me anymore.

510
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Xiao Tao.

511
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
The female army.

512
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
I've brought the food.

513
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Bring it in for her.

514
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Don't make things difficult for me anymore.

515
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
You won't send it to her, right?

516
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
I'll put it here.

517
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
You can take it out and take it back.

518
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,780
I'll take it.

519
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,780
I've offended the male army again.

520
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Please punish me.

521
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
I didn't offend you.

522
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Didn't you ask me to come out and get it?

523
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
I'm out.

524
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Why are you hiding from me?

525
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
I'm not hiding from you.

526
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
If you're unhappy, just tell me.

527
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,780
Thank you for your consideration.

528
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
This is for you.

529
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
The subordinates will direct benefits to them,

530
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,780
and also said you can arrange them to sell farmers' goods

531
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
by investing in their land.

532
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
You can just put them there.

533
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,780
새辰,

534
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
I've heard about it from Xiao Tan.

535
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
The boy like Nan Jun is really great.

536
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,780
So he wants to make peace with me.

537
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,900
He's quite sensible.

538
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,260
If he's guilty,

539
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,980
I have an idea.

540
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,020
I just want to spend some money.

541
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,700
That's not easy.

542
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,020
You have a memory.

543
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,660
If it's not enough, I have more.

544
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,380
Where did you get so much money?

545
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,420
Now the street is almost full of beggars.

546
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,660
Don't worry, my lady.

547
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,860
I won't let you run out of money.

548
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,180
No wonder you run out every day.

549
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,300
What do you want to buy?

550
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
A zither.

551
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,900
Why?

552
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,460
I miss my sister.

553
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,700
Okay.

554
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,980
I'll buy something expensive.

555
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,980
As long as you want.

556
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,660
Okay.

557
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,380
My lady, I'm waiting for you.

558
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,660
What are you doing?

559
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,420
Come on.

560
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,740
Nanjun.

561
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,540
What do you mean?

562
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,260
I'm not good at playing.

563
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,940
I'm embarrassed.

564
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,820
You're not good at playing.

565
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,220
I'll practice more every day.

566
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,900
I don't think you need to.

567
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,740
Let's eat.

568
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,380
Let's eat.

569
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,700
Why are you crying?

570
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I told you.

571
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,340
If you have any grievances, just tell me.

572
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,340
Tell me.

573
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,620
What's wrong?

574
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,620
It's...

575
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,500
It's my sister.

576
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,300
She took me to the palace.

577
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,220
Before she died,

578
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,380
she gave me this zither.

579
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,340
Now she's cleaning up her mother's house.

580
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,500
When she brought things,

581
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,700
she saw this zither.

582
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,980
It's unique.

583
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,140
I can see it clearly.

584
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,660
You two

585
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,260
are really close.

586
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,100
Yes.

587
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,180
Sister Zhang also wrote that

588
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,100
she and her son were eloping.

589
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,380
She had a hard time.

590
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,620
But I was in the house

591
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,980
enjoying the rich family.

592
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,780
I was really heartbroken.

593
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
It's not easy.

594
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,660
Send her some food and clothes.

595
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,780
Let her live a better life.

596
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,780
No one will send her food and clothes.

597
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,940
She eloped with someone.

598
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,100
Uncle doesn't care about her.

599
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,780
It's okay.

600
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,860
I'll send her.

601
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,180
Really?

602
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,660
Yes.

603
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,580
Where is she now?

604
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,580
She's...

605
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,340
in Boya.

606
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,100
Boya?

607
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,380
Do you think this place is too far away?

608
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
I'm thinking...

609
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,380
why they're in Boya?

610
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,940
Sister Zhang and the handwriting

611
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,140
don't have the identity certificate.

612
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,300
They can't enter the city.

613
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,740
So they can only find

614
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,420
a place with no one to control

615
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,300
to live a happy life.

616
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,940
Nanjun.

617
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,020
Are you still going to do what you promised me?

618
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,660
I'm going to make a book.

619
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,860
How about this?

620
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,900
Send me something you want to send.

621
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,740
I'll send it to her.

622
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,540
I have no other choice.

623
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,980
I can only practice Konghou everyday

624
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,940
and give it to Nanjun and the others.

625
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,420
You don't need to do that.

626
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
You're not suitable.

627
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,500
You're suitable for eating.

628
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,300
Eat.

629
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,900
Do you want me to talk to her again?

630
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,500
No.

631
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,140
Eat.

632
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,340
Why did you send something to the sister of the female village?

633
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,580
Why did you send us?

634
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Master.

635
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,820
You can't marry her

636
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,940
and be a rich man.

637
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,140
That's right, Master.

638
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,500
It seems like

639
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,900
we're sending her something to eat.

640
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,820
But we don't know much about

641
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,060
that Boya's commander-in-chief.

642
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,540
We can take this opportunity to find out.

643
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,780
You're so wise.

644
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,340
Alright.

645
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,300
You decide who goes there.

646
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,100
Come on.

647
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,260
Let's play a game.

648
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,420
Again?

649
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,900
I've never been attracted to you.

650
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,500
Are you trying to trick me?

651
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,700
Who do you think I am?

652
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,500
Go away.

653
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,300
I'll leave it to you.

654
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,940
I'll send it to you.

655
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,620
Is that okay?

656
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,940
It seems that I'm the only one

657
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,980
who can go to the stockade.

658
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,300
Yes.

659
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,660
So that you won't say I'm a fool.

660
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,580
I'm not.

661
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,980
That man can't fight,

662
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,180
so I can't fight.

663
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,540
Such a big camp

664
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,140
is more good-for-nothing

665
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,340
than the female soldiers' truck.

666
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,420
I don't believe up to 80% of it.

667
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,140
People can't live in town

668
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,580
that's veryaloaced.

669
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,620
Not to that extent

670
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
even if you go.

671
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,580
Don't be misunderstood.

672
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,260
It's slight.

673
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,220
We can only deal with the country.

674
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,660
I know what you mean.

675
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,540
Don't worry.

676
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,140
Don't worry.

677
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,940
Did you buy so many things for your elder sister?

678
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,220
It's good for you to buy more clothes.

679
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,700
In case you don't have to deal with the private matters.

680
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,520
This is the

681
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,900
I prepared for her.

682
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,900
It's okay.

683
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,260
I see that Nanjun brought a lot of household goods.

684
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,740
If you need anything from your elder sister,

685
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,100
please help them.

686
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,340
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

687
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,540
Okay, let's go.

688
00:35:59,540 --> 00:35:59,940
Okay.

689
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,540
Why is she so active this time?

690
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,540
It's a good thing.

691
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,300
Why do you want to do this hard work?

692
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,380
There are mountains,

693
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,380
there are forests,

694
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
and there are earthen wells in the country.

695
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,660
Not to mention her,

696
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,620
I want to go too.

697
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,620
Okay, let's go.

698
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,660
Go.

699
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,140
The terrain of Guya is indeed complicated.

700
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,980
There are mountains and forests.

701
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,940
Please hold on for a while.

702
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
We'll be there soon.

703
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,300
Let's move over.

704
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,420
I can see you can add food later.

705
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,300
Bring me a bow and arrow.

706
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,500
You!

707
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,220
Who is it?

708
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
I hit a bamboo.

709
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,460
And you took it away?

710
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,060
I hit it.

711
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,540
How can it be you?

712
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,540
You're good at

713
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,060
running a trap.

714
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,620
If you want it,

715
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
I can give it to you.

716
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,300
It's hard to learn how to use a bamboo.

717
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,780
You just give it to me like this?

718
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,900
If you want to cut the meat,

719
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,140
So take it.

720
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,980
Just use me as weapon.

721
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,100
sobre evacuation

722
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,640
ід

723
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm Pizhi.

724
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,480
We are the same.

725
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,940
Brother Pizhi.

726
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,240
An gratitude chest is in need.

727
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,500
He meets you here.

728
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,120
General Wei.

729
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,460
Lu Brahe.

730
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,800
You're really

731
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I'm sorry to see you here.

732
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,080
The female army misses the female wolf.

733
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,240
The male army cares about the female army.

734
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,200
So they sent us here

735
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,720
to deliver some food and food.

736
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,320
Thank you.

737
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,400
Brother Wei Qu.

738
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,720
General Li Zhi.

739
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,520
So many things.

740
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,160
Drink some water.

741
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,760
General Li Zhi.

742
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,240
When I was in Yujin,

743
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
I heard about your brave action.

744
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
I didn't expect that the legendary

745
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,360
Bo Yaju, the commander-in-chief,

746
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,280
is actually a self-proclaimed man.

747
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,280
You're flattering me.

748
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Sister Zhang,

749
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,240
I can see you clearly.

750
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,880
Now Xue Tai is in danger.

751
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,120
He can use the other's help to solve it.

752
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,000
The mountain is high and the water is far.

753
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,680
Xue Tai's army is full of people.

754
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,240
The most dangerous is the battle of the sea.

755
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,520
Sister Zhang ordered Bi Zhi

756
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,760
to send the Marquis of Wei's soldiers

757
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,120
to the high ground

758
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,760
to build a horse-drawn water.

759
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,040
Bi Zhi will win without a fight.

760
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,200
If he goes any further,

761
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
he will stop Bo Ya

762
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,040
and be able to win the three-year contract of Wei.

763
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,400
It's about the fate of Yan State.

764
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,600
He must do his best.

765
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,920
Manman.

766
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,880
Hurry up.

767
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,640
Okay.

768
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,880
Hurry up.

769
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,680
Over there.

770
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,240
Report.

771
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,200
General,

772
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,440
more than 100 people

773
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,360
are under pressure to reach Bo Ya

774
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,240
and the flow of the same river.

775
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,680
According to the people of Bo Ya,

776
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,800
one of them is from the direction of Yu Jun of Wei.

777
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,720
Wei?

778
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,680
A soldier?

779
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,760
It's said that it's the girl's sister

780
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,440
who sent it from Yu Jun.

781
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,480
But her sister married the Marquis of Wei.

782
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,080
This person is a soldier.

783
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,760
It's hard to say.

784
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,040
Wei Shao

785
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,880
is not enough to get the plate.

786
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,760
Do you want to get into Bo Ya?

787
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,000
Report again.

788
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,600
Yes.

789
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,520
Didn't the Marquis of Wei say that

790
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,960
the Southern Army is not suitable?

791
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,240
Why is it so dark now?

792
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,000
It's dark again.

793
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,640
It's not bright.

794
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,960
He always says that his head hurts.

795
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,120
I don't know if it's because

796
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,800
he's not feeling well.

797
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,760
So I want to change him.

798
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,200
But these materials are good.

799
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,320
It's not comfortable to touch.

800
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,280
Yu Jun

801
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
This is the top-grade material

802
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,240
that Mrs. Ding sent from Yan State.

803
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,160
Yu Jun doesn't want to use it.

804
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,040
So he wants to take it out

805
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,240
and make it for the Southern Army.

806
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,400
He gave me so many things

807
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,120
from my sister.

808
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,480
I always have to return it.

809
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
You're right.

810
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Yu Jun

811
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,280
Which material do you want to use?

812
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,360
Touch it.

813
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,000
Is this okay?

814
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,640
It's too hard.

815
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,520
Then you can touch this.

816
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
This is soft.

817
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Then use this.

818
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,960
Okay.

819
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Then we'll use this.

820
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Master

821
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,640
General Wei Qu sent a message.

822
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,280
He has arrived at the territory of Bo Ya.

823
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,440
He has met the commander-in-chief of the Central Army.

824
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,160
So fast.

825
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,920
Then who is the commander-in-chief of the Central Army?

826
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,480
It's your daughter, Bi Zhi.

827
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,600
She is the daughter?

828
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,640
That's interesting.

829
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,400
No one asked about her daughter.

830
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,440
But now she is taken by Bi Zhi.

831
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,880
She is the daughter of the commander-in-chief

832
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,320
of the Central Army.

833
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,200
She is standing there.

834
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,000
But it's decided that

835
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,040
whether Bo Ya's surname is Qiao

836
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,320
or Wei.

837
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
I don't know.

838
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,240
You can say it directly.

839
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,680
General Wei Qu

840
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,200
is entrusted by the female army.

841
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,720
I don't know if the female army is a good doctor.

842
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,560
What kind of doctor can it be?

843
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,640
If the female army knows

844
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,080
that Bi Zhi is the commander-in-chief of the Central Army,

845
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,400
she will definitely tell me.

846
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,840
Don't worry.

847
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,120
She won't keep it from me.

848
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,000
Here.

849
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,600
You are back so early today.

850
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,360
Yes.

851
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,720
I'm here to congratulate you.

852
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,800
For what?

853
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,960
Do you know

854
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,480
who is the commander-in-chief of Bo Ya?

855
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,840
Who is he?

856
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,280
Your brother-in-law,

857
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,760
Bi Zhi.

858
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,240
Don't joke, Nan Jun.

859
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,600
My brother-in-law is just a horse slave.

860
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,440
Water milk.

861
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,240
A-2 farm.

862
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,160
A-2 water milk.

863
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,960
More protein.

864
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,800
Higher calcium.

865
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,280
Energy breakfast.

866
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,560
Watch the magic.
