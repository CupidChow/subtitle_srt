=Episode 13=

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Mr. Wei.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,060
Your calligraphy is elegant and refined,

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,700
just like your character.

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,420
Even the ink smells fragrant.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
It suits you

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,060
perfectly.

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,300
You flatter me, Yan.

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,500
With Grandmother's
birthday banquet approaching,

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm just making

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
some simple preparations.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,260
I didn't mean to show
my poor skills before you.

41
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,140
I've run out of ink sticks.

42
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,380
I'll go fetch some.

43
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,300
Wait a minute.

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,140
I came today

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,140
to thank you personally.

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,420
I've done nothing for you.

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
There is no need to thank me.

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
Regarding Rongjun,

49
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
in the past,

50
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,700
I held some misunderstandings about you.

51
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,820
I had no idea you'd do so much

52
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,980
for the people of Rongjun.

53
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,820
To relieve the famine there,

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,700
you even wrote to your family
for wheat seeds.

55
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
I also learned

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,140
you studied
the Local Records of Rongjun,

57
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,020
and included in your letter
the local climate, rainfall,

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,420
and the people's preferences,

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,860
all for obtaining the suitable seeds.

60
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,700
Yet I was narrow-minded,

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,420
I had thought

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,740
you were writing to Yanzhou

63
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,020
to seek outside aid.

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,300
Had it not been for Zhonglin,

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,420
who read the letter to me word by word,

66
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,620
I'd never have known

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,020
how righteous and devoted you are.

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,910
On behalf of the people of Rongjun,

69
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,020
I thank you.

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,980
This is too much.

71
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,860
Wei Liang must have known all along.

72
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,420
I even helped him calculate

73
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,100
how to transport grain to Rongjun.

74
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,700
Will you be quiet?

75
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,100
Stop making things worse.

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,900
I just can't bear
to see her being treated this way.

77
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,300
She married far from home

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,460
and merely confided

79
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,260
(Rongjun)
a few words in her letter home,

80
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
(Heaven blesses you; all shall thrive.)
but he even insisted on inspecting that.

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,300
Reading it was one thing,

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,820
but to read it to his cousin?

83
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,700
Exactly.

84
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,420
Prepare the ink.

85
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,140
I'm sending another letter to Yanzhou.

86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,100
Again?

87
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,940
My Lord,

88
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,580
Mrs. Wei's sent another letter to Yanzhou.

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,300
Read it.

90
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Come here.

91
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,820
Read it.

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,820
Mrs. Wei's letter.

93
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,020
I'll give you a chance.

94
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,380
Why don't you read it?

95
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,620
Well,

96
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,060
no need to read it.

97
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,940
I can pretty much guess what it says.

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,260
Probably about the famine in Rongjun,

99
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,700
asking for more wheat seeds,

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,620
and things like that.

101
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,180
Mrs. Wei

102
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,580
still cares for Wei.

103
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,260
My throat's sore.

104
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,380
You read it. Come.

105
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
Here, take it.

106
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,020
I haven't read much.

107
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,140
There are words I don't know.

108
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,140
I'll check later.

109
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,580
I've always told you to read more books,

110
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,300
but you never listened.

111
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
Now, even the simple…

112
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,060
My Lord,

113
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,940
no need to read this letter.

114
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,140
Indeed.

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,060
Didn't I already say?

116
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,300
I can pretty much guess what's written.

117
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,380
At most, she added

118
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,740
some flattering words.

119
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,260
Something like:

120
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,580
"My Lord cares for all under heaven."

121
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,180
"To have such a ruler

122
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,500
is a blessing for the people."

123
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,940
That's about it.

124
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
Forget it. Don't read it.

125
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,780
Tan, send it to Yanzhou.

126
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,380
It can't be sent to Yanzhou.

127
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,620
It has your name on it.

128
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
It must not be sent.

129
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,860
Let me see it.

130
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Give it to me.

131
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,500
What's gotten into you today?

132
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,980
(Shame on Wei Shao)

133
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,860
My Lord, calm your anger.

134
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,940
Mrs. Wei must've found out

135
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,820
about you checking the letters.

136
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
Indeed, it was your...

137
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,620
Our fault.

138
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,470
Yes, that's right.

139
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,620
Don't act rashly.

140
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,820
That's right, My Lord.

141
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,740
At worst, hide in the study tonight

142
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,620
to avoid a storm at home, right?

143
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,500
Hide?

144
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,060
Are you serious?

145
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,060
I must confront her.

146
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,740
That fierce woman is getting bolder.

147
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,060
I've had a long day at work.

148
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,020
I'm tired.

149
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,860
I'll rest now.

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,380
Overseeing everything yourself,

151
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,700
no wonder you're exhausted.

152
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,260
Yes.

153
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,620
And you've also

154
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,060
worked hard these days
preparing for the banquet.

155
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,020
Get some rest.

156
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,060
The menu for Grandmother's
birthday banquet.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,740
Please have a look.

158
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,940
You can decide on your own.

159
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Such a small matter.

160
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,020
I only just came here.

161
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,180
I still don't know everyone's

162
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
tastes and taboos.

163
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,740
If I prepared

164
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
something that

165
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,300
displeased someone,

166
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,380
it would be inappropriate.

167
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,020
It's best if you check it yourself.

168
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,260
Fine.

169
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,780
Everything looks excellent.

170
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,900
No complaints.

171
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,860
Get some rest.

172
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,900
And the banquet purchase accounts.

173
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,260
Please have a look.

174
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,740
If any discrepancies

175
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,780
appear on the day,

176
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,220
it would not be proper.

177
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,260
Everything is detailed.

178
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,740
No problem.

179
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,100
When I was preparing invitations,

180
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
I wasn't sure which character to use.

181
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,780
(Longevity)
There are eight styles in this scroll.

182
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,100
Please look them over

183
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
and decide.

184
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,260
Wei Shao, get up!

185
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,540
Get up!

186
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,660
What did you just call me?

187
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,260
Does it matter?

188
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,740
Why did you read my letters?

189
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,900
Wait. You…

190
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,740
How dare you call me by name?

191
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,660
Listen up.

192
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,020
You were fierce enough before,

193
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,540
now you're also rude and disrespectful.

194
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,860
I have nothing to say to you.

195
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,340
Only I would have

196
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,620
married you.

197
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,540
Count yourself lucky for that.

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,340
Come back here.

199
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,780
You're no better yourself.

200
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,220
Suspicious all day.

201
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,100
If you can't win an argument,
you just run off.

202
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,260
There are plenty who'd want me.

203
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,900
Small eyes,

204
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,140
and an even smaller heart.

205
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,860
Tall is the only good thing about you.

206
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,460
You dare throw it at me?

207
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,500
I...

208
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm going to let that go.

209
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,180
What now?

210
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,620
Why wouldn't I?

211
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,460
(Luozhong Tavern)

212
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,700
(Luozhong Tavern)

213
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,620
Watch from the sidelines.

214
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,340
Report any new developments

215
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,900
immediately.

216
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,380
Yes, Young Master.

217
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,740
That young lady

218
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,140
dared to call Zhonglin by name?

219
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,380
How interesting.

220
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,380
My Lady,

221
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
would you like to try some first?

222
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,500
If someone's done wrong,

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,260
isn't it just a matter of apologizing?

224
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,220
What's wrong with him?

225
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
Yeah.

226
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,740
First he slept in the study

227
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
last night,

228
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,860
and now he won't even
come home for meals.

229
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,540
So petty.

230
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Xiaotao, Xiaozao.

231
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
Stop badmouthing him.

232
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,380
When he returns,

233
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,900
you mustn't show him attitude.

234
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,100
Understood.

235
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,140
I wouldn't dare.

236
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
My Lady,

237
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,620
speak with him properly

238
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,140
when he returns.

239
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,540
There's nothing that can't be talked out.

240
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,500
We live under his roof now.

241
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,260
Best to get by peacefully.

242
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,620
I know what I'm doing.

243
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,220
Yes.

244
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,340
My Lady, Tan is here.

245
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,260
Let him in.

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,100
Yes.

247
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,460
My Lady.

248
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,620
My Lord sends word:

249
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,740
He won't return for the meal.

250
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,820
See?

251
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,860
He's clearly avoiding her.

252
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
My Lady didn't say a word,

253
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,020
but he's playing the victim.

254
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,220
Enough.

255
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,220
Bring me brush and ink.

256
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
I must write to Cousin now,

257
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,860
lest she writes anything important
in her next letter.

258
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,700
Yes, My Lady.

259
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,820
(Boya)

260
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,660
(Qiao)

261
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,020
Dear Cousin,

262
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,260
may this letter find you well.

263
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,900
Since your husband took Boya,

264
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,500
matters in Yujun have been many.

265
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,980
So I haven't written until now.

266
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,140
But Lord of Wei and I miss you deeply.

267
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,340
We only hope you and your husband

268
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,100
find peace and joy in Boya.

269
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,100
If you run into trouble,
just write to me.

270
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,980
When Lord of Wei

271
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,860
and I see the letter,

272
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,500
we'll send someone to Boya right away.

273
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,620
General.

274
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,580
Fan.

275
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,380
Dear, you've worked hard today.

276
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,860
How's the construction going?

277
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,740
All is well.

278
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,780
Fan, don't worry.

279
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,430
Is this a letter from Mrs. Wei?

280
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,780
She must be reminding us again

281
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,660
to live well in Boya.

282
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,620
Manman said,

283
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,660
now that Yanzhou has taken Boya,

284
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,980
so the Lord of Wei is wary.

285
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,380
She reminded me to be cautious
in our future letters.

286
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,380
(Peace and Prosperity)

287
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,980
My Lord,

288
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,460
Mrs. Wei gave me this.

289
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,260
She said it's a Sutra copied for Lady Xu

290
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,980
and asked you to review it.

291
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,340
Even the Sutra needs my review?

292
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,980
Mrs. Wei said,

293
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,620
it must be checked by you.

294
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,220
If there are any errors,

295
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,740
it'd be disrespectful,

296
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,980
and might upset Lady Xu.

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,380
That fierce woman.

298
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,500
She never lets things go.

299
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,460
She also asked when you'll

300
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,380
be returning today.

301
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Go tell her:

302
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
I'll sleep in the study tonight.

303
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,660
The study window is drafty.

304
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,740
You couldn't sleep
because of the cold.

305
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,020
If you stay another night,

306
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,500
you might catch a chill.

307
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,360
You…

308
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,420
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

309
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Wei Duo?

310
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,780
Greetings, My Lord.

311
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,740
When did you return?

312
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,500
I just got back

313
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,380
and came straight here
to report the good news.

314
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,380
What good news?

315
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,220
My Lord, the Yongning Canal is now open.

316
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,540
I haven't slacked off a bit.

317
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,020
This is from Yang Feng, Panyi mayor.

318
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,860
He personally copied down the details

319
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,020
and asked me to bring them back
for your review.

320
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,340
(Yongning Canal Construction Details)

321
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,260
Is Yang Feng

322
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,840
trying to claim credit?

323
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,580
Only after visiting Panyi
did I understand

324
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,020
the benefits of abundant water.

325
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,380
Yanzhou's prosperity all owes to water.

326
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,420
Panyi's wheat yield is high,
with many tillers.

327
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,570
Each grain's full and heavy.

328
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,620
The taste is excellent.

329
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,540
This is wheat from Panyi.

330
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,260
And this is from Xindu.

331
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,020
The mayor said,
now that the canal is open,

332
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,660
Xindu's wheat will be just

333
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
as good as Panyi's.

334
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,620
If it brings such benefits,

335
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,980
why not extend the Yongning Canal

336
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,380
all the way to Rongjun?

337
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,540
That'd ease future concerns.

338
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,740
If we keep improving irrigation,

339
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,020
we'll need to invest
more people and funds,

340
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,980
and that will draw on Wei's troops.

341
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,660
If Yanzhou invades now,

342
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,660
Wei may not protect itself.

343
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,540
My Lord,

344
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,260
are you worried

345
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
the Qiao Clan might benefit from this?

346
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,900
In my view, My Lord,

347
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,020
there's no need
to fear the Qiao Clan so much.

348
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,180
Canal construction

349
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,780
might prolong Yanzhou's fate by years,

350
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,900
but it's the common people of Rongjun

351
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
who'll truly benefit
for generations in Wei.

352
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,020
Let me think it over.

353
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,500
My Lord,

354
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,220
we're on duty

355
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,980
outside the city tonight.

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,020
If we don't leave now,

357
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,700
we might delay our duties.

358
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
If there's nothing else,

359
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,500
then we'll

360
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,580
take our leave now.

361
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Well,

362
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,380
just go.

363
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,500
Let's go.

364
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,820
My Lord,

365
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,900
you haven't returned home this late.

366
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,340
Are you still fretting

367
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,300
about the letter?

368
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,220
How could that be possible?

369
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,700
There's no such thing.

370
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,700
Glad to hear that.

371
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,260
Mrs. Wei should be

372
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,100
waiting for you to return home.

373
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,020
Yeah.

374
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,780
Maybe.

375
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,860
Very well.

376
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,020
I'll take my leave now.

377
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,820
Suddenly, it occurs to me,

378
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,940
it's been a long while

379
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,020
since I last visited Madam
at your home.

380
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
It's alright, really.

381
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,260
No, no, no.

382
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,740
There's no better time than now.

383
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,500
How about this?

384
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,900
I'll drop by

385
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
for a short visit

386
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,100
and greet her.

387
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
Let's go, sir.

388
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,020
Very well.

389
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,780
Very well.

390
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,340
Who would've thought
he'd keep us this late?

391
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,900
Only taverns are still open.

392
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,780
Taverns are great.

393
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,460
Wei Duo is grown. Time to see more.

394
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,180
- Right.
- Where to?

395
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,580
My Lord.

396
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
Aren't you on duty?

397
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,900
My Lord.

398
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,260
It's my fault.

399
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,020
My Lord, they meant well,
to welcome me.

400
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,860
Just punish me.

401
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,300
- Punish me.
- No, punish me.

402
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
- It's my mistake.
- No.

403
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,540
I shouldn't have done it.

404
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
It was my idea.

405
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,700
- Punish me.
- Enough.

406
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,100
My treat.

407
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,820
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

408
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,700
Thank you, My Lord.

409
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,540
My Lord, where are we heading now?

410
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,810
We've been walking for a while.

411
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,660
To see Grandmother.

412
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,820
Lady Xu

413
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,540
likely went to bed hours ago.

414
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,780
It's so late now.

415
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,260
I'm afraid only Luozhong Tavern

416
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,340
would still be buzzing.

417
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,580
Zhonglin,

418
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,740
since I came of age,

419
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,940
I've never suffered like this.

420
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,180
Always surrounded by beauties.

421
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,900
Yet

422
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,020
now there's

423
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,940
a towering man

424
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,420
by my side.

425
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,660
I came with good intentions.

426
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,740
It's just too late

427
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,900
to return home,

428
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,780
so

429
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm staying the night.

430
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,100
Just one night.

431
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
You're being stingy.

432
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,340
Cousin.

433
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,300
I didn't mean to blame you.

434
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,340
I just wanted to know

435
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,820
why you

436
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,020
told her I read her letters.

437
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,900
Even though I know,

438
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
you always

439
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,660
see her as an outsider

440
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,980
and never fully trust her.

441
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,340
I don't believe Qiao and Wei

442
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,660
have ever truly trusted each other.

443
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,580
I wanted to know,

444
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,820
when it comes to canal construction,

445
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,300
are they really free of other motives?

446
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,000
As for the canal,

447
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,100
I've made my decision.

448
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,740
I believe

449
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,540
your heart has made its choice.

450
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,820
Zhonglin,

451
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,300
do you still kick off your quilt
when you sleep?

452
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,180
Get some sleep.

453
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,700
Please, Young Master,

454
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,360
kill the Lord of Wei

455
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,060
for Bianzhou's peace.

456
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,300
No.

457
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,210
I've noticed tension
between Zhonglin and Lady Qiao.

458
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,260
Just wait patiently

459
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,740
a while longer,

460
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,100
and we can shatter their alliance
in one blow.

461
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,660
If he starts
canal construction in Rongjun,

462
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,540
Wei will surround Bianzhou on all sides.

463
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,530
But if Lord of Wei falls,

464
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,650
Bianzhou will have nothing more to fear.

465
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,500
This is a plan for the long term.

466
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,700
Now, he stays in your residence.

467
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,740
I've laced his tea

468
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,100
with knockout drops.

469
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,940
Young Master, please,

470
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,260
do not let mercy

471
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,900
spoil this chance to eliminate our foe.

472
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,320
To break the Qiao-Wei alliance,

473
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,340
I have no objection.

474
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,420
Even if you intend to poison Lady Qiao,

475
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
I will not interfere.

476
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,060
But I've made it clear to him,

477
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
no one may

478
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,020
take my cousin's life.

479
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,060
Absolutely not.

480
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,820
You consider yourself
part of the Wei Clan,

481
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,060
but they don't see it that way.

482
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,280
You are gifted in strategy
and martial skill,

483
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,500
yet they've humiliated you for years.

484
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,700
They spread rumors

485
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,020
you were a servant's illegitimate child,

486
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,700
so you'd never be trusted or promoted.

487
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,980
How unjust this is.

488
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580
Were it not for your journey

489
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,820
to Bianzhou last year,

490
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,460
and the reunion with your father,

491
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,940
who knows how long you'd have suffered?

492
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,420
Grandmother's treated me with kindness.

493
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,580
Yes.

494
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,580
You were raised by Lady Xu.

495
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,660
But all these years,

496
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,100
she never intervened in your matters,

497
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,180
nor has she ever reproached you.

498
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,260
Yet she is strict with the Lord of Wei.

499
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,020
Can't you see her intentions?

500
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,660
She was guarding against you

501
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,300
to stop you from gaining military power.

502
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
Say no more about my grandmother.

503
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,780
If you dare bring this up again,

504
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,300
I won't let you return Bianzhou alive.

505
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,220
Young Master.

506
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,020
Leave.

507
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,020
Why are you still

508
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,500
asking the Governor for wheat seeds?

509
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,940
My uncle is always calculating.

510
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,580
Whenever help is needed from him,

511
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,300
he tends to make excuses.

512
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,100
He fears any loss to himself.

513
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,500
I must write him another letter

514
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,060
to stress how serious this is.

515
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,900
He must not take this lightly.

516
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,940
I don't understand.

517
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
He trusts you so little.

518
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,740
Why are you helping Rongjun
get wheat seeds?

519
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
He'll never

520
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,100
appreciate your efforts.

521
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,260
How do you think he treats me?

522
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,900
It's inconsistent.

523
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,980
In front of Wei Yan and Lady Zhu,

524
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,500
he protects you.

525
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,660
He treats you quite well.

526
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,060
But when it comes
to the letter incident,

527
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,780
his methods were despicable.

528
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,300
So, he treated you terribly.

529
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,180
It means he keeps work and home apart.

530
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,100
Troubles from Mother and Cousin

531
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,580
are family matters after all.

532
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,580
He can stand up for his wife
and trust her fully.

533
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,820
But my letter to Yanzhou,

534
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,820
(Dear Uncle)
involving the safety of Wei,

535
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,980
that is state business.

536
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,300
As the Lord of Wei,

537
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,260
he carries the hopes
of the common people.

538
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,700
Of course he can't fully
trust the Qiao Clan of Yanzhou.

539
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,180
Though you're angry with him,

540
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,580
you're still compartmentalized.

541
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,980
(Why not offer both kinds
of wheat as a gift?)

542
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,420
The wheat,

543
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,020
while high yielding,

544
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,700
requires a great deal of water.

545
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,300
I wonder if he'll

546
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,260
start canal construction in Rongjun.

547
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,860
Very well.

548
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,020
Send out my orders.

549
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,820
The canal in Rongjun

550
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,940
must be scheduled.

551
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
Yes.

552
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,740
Generals, a moment, please.

553
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,420
There's one more matter

554
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,020
that requires your decision, My Lord.

555
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,740
Go ahead, sir.

556
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,580
General Wei Duo,

557
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,020
tell us.

558
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,980
What kind of man is Yang Feng?

559
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,900
He is

560
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,460
best at saving money.

561
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,740
What do you mean?

562
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,220
He and Zhen Zhi were each tasked
with building canals.

563
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,500
One in Xindu, the other in Panyi.

564
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,540
Panyi's canal was completed much faster.

565
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,900
Shorter construction means lower costs.

566
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,340
He's able to adjust plans

567
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,820
based on terrain, soil, and weather,

568
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,060
and commands the people well.

569
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,520
They used silt to enrich farmland,

570
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,630
turning waste into treasure.

571
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,140
My Lord,

572
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,100
this canal in Rongjun

573
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,900
affects tens of thousands.

574
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,340
Our generals are skilled in war,

575
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,580
but not in waterworks.

576
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,540
As of now, we have no suitable overseer.

577
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,300
Sir,

578
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,940
are you recommending Yang Feng?

579
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,780
Yang Feng is not only cost-effective,

580
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,740
but also a trusted aide of Mrs. Wei.

581
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
If you appoint him,

582
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,740
it would be seen as a gesture of trust

583
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,580
toward Mrs. Wei and Yanzhou.

584
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,020
It has nothing to do with her.

585
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,260
Yes, yes.

586
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,540
My Lord,

587
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,260
think of the greater good.

588
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,660
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

589
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,860
Uncle,

590
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,060
Sister just wants wheat seeds
as a birthday gift.

591
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,940
Why are you making it so difficult?

592
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,020
You don't understand.

593
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,420
Call it a birthday gift if you want,

594
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,780
but to put it bluntly,

595
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,740
this is stripping Yanzhou's foundation.

596
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,020
If Wei widely adopts the wheat,

597
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,940
they'll grow wealthy within years.

598
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,500
Who's to say

599
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,400
they won't turn their armies
against us by then?

600
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,260
That's overly severe.

601
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,740
The Qiao and Wei clans are now allies,

602
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,860
and tied by marriage as well.

603
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,740
Such things won't happen.

604
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,100
With Sister there,

605
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,940
she'd never have him to start war.

606
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,660
Manman's always been clever.

607
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,500
She knows how important it's to Yanzhou.

608
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,180
If it weren't urgent

609
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,750
or of great benefit,

610
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,150
she wouldn't have written to ask for it.

611
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,940
Brother,

612
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,020
just give it to her.

613
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,180
Don't make things harder for her.

614
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,300
Father and I are both in Kangjun.

615
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,940
She's thinking of Yanzhou's interests.

616
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,540
Alright.

617
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,820
When Father was alive,

618
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,660
he often aided Wei as well.

619
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,940
Since Manman insists on the seeds,

620
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,180
then let her have them.

621
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,300
You truly carry the spirit of Lord Qiao.

622
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,100
My Lord, you're back.

623
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,400
Seeing you study the map

624
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,660
reminds me that

625
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,180
there's news you may not know yet.

626
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,020
I've already decided

627
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,040
to start canal construction
from Xindu to Rongjun.

628
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,500
How wise of you.

629
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,180
I've pondered this matter for a long time,

630
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,740
but in the end,

631
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,420
I've chosen to follow your advice.

632
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,940
Are you pleased now?

633
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,420
And what does Advisor think?

634
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,740
As for the Advisor,

635
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,260
I've tried to persuade him,

636
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,180
and he has no other objections.

637
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,300
So this was Advisor's idea all along.

638
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,820
Then I must thank him.

639
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,900
Also,

640
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,540
I've decided

641
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
to appoint Yang Feng

642
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,980
as overseer of the canal works.

643
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,540
I know Yang Feng is your clan's…

644
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,340
Which makes me
more grateful to Advisor.

645
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,820
This canal project touches

646
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,220
upon both Yanzhou

647
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,060
and Wei.

648
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,900
If you have any thoughts,

649
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
share them with me.

650
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,020
You are wise enough

651
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,460
to make your own decisions, My Lord.

652
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,420
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

653
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,260
Report.

654
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,620
My Lord, General Chen Pang
seeks audience.

655
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,860
Every year, we go to Mount Yi to pray.

656
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,700
It's a tradition set by our ancestors.

657
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,820
How could you change the plan

658
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,060
because of a woman?

659
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,940
How would I explain to our kin,

660
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,180
and to the soldiers?

661
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,860
Uncle, calm down.

662
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,540
My lady is unwell today.

663
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,660
It's right that I stay by her side.

664
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,500
As for the prayer,

665
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,100
we can go another day.

666
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,020
Sincerity is what the heavens heed.

667
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Report.

668
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,640
My Lord,

669
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,500
the Longevity Hall on Mount Yi collapsed.

670
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,620
All the worshippers within

671
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,100
were crushed beneath the ruins.

672
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,180
None survived.

673
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,460
Your huadian

674
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,460
is truly auspicious.

675
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,380
It seems to ward off misfortune.

676
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,140
There was no earthquake,

677
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,100
nor a heavy storm,

678
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,340
so why did the hall collapse?

679
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,540
Perhaps,

680
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,380
someone planned this in secret

681
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
with hidden intentions.

682
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,180
Uncle,

683
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,060
I'm tired today,

684
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,020
so I won't keep you any longer.

685
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,100
Darling,

686
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,500
shall I call the physician?

687
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,420
It's nothing.

688
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,580
Darling, don't worry.

689
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,700
Although I do not know

690
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,060
if this huadian

691
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,140
can help one rule the land,

692
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,380
what I truly wish for is

693
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,660
that this huadian brings blessings

694
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,660
and keeps my darling

695
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,780
safe

696
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,620
and healthy.

697
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,220
You will recover, I promise.

698
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,580
Having you by my side

699
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,540
is truly my greatest fortune.

700
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,180
If you have worries,

701
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,580
please share them with me.

702
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,900
A scout reported two days ago,

703
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,460
that Wei

704
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,580
plans to connect the Yongning Canal

705
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,380
directly to Rongjun.

706
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,820
A canal

707
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,420
means grain transport

708
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,180
and swift military movements.

709
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,820
If they come,

710
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,980
Bianzhou will

711
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,300
be truly in grave danger.

712
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm willing to visit Yujun

713
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,700
to resolve this matter.

714
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,300
Darling, do you know

715
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,180
Lady Xu of the Wei Clan

716
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,700
is my great-aunt?

717
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,580
I was raised

718
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,140
in the Wei household as a child,

719
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,620
and I endured with the Lord of Wei

720
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,980
the grief of the Wei clan.

721
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,060
Now,

722
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,340
with but a subtle word,

723
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,660
I can stir old grudges

724
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,620
and shatter

725
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,980
the Qiao-Wei alliance.

726
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,460
Zhonglin,

727
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,220
do you know

728
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,500
what's planted here?

729
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,380
It's

730
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,140
millet?

731
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,140
Shiyuan,

732
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,580
do you know?

733
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,460
I only know sorghum makes rich wine,

734
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,860
while millet brings a sweet aroma.

735
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,500
But as for this one,
I don't know its taste.

736
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,980
You wander all over,

737
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,060
yet you don't know about grains.

738
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,140
Grandmother,

739
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,100
if you ask me,

740
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,140
which region has the finest women,

741
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,380
that, I could answer easily.

742
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,820
Nonsense again.

743
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,100
Lady Qiao,

744
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,500
do you know?

745
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,940
It's Ji.

746
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,620
That's what we usually call
foxtail millet.

747
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,980
Speaking of raising children,

748
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,020
I'm not as good as your Grandfather,
Lord Qiao.

749
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,620
You've been preparing the banquet.

750
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,540
Any difficulties?

751
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,580
I've already started
arranging the guest seating.

752
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,060
The guest lists have been sent
to each region.

753
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,540
Grandmother, no worries.

754
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,500
Anything I don't know,
I've asked Mother.

755
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,980
About arranging the seats,

756
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,100
it seems simple,

757
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,020
but there's actually a lot to it.

758
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,500
Outwardly, it reflects rank

759
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,580
and closeness of ties.

760
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,860
But privately,

761
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,380
some guests have close ties,

762
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,860
so they want to sit together,

763
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,420
while others don't get along,

764
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,020
so they must be seated far apart.

765
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,980
There can't be any mistakes in this.

766
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,700
Otherwise, people will quietly complain.

767
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,340
I have a guest from Bianzhou
who's not on the list.

768
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,180
She's a junior I know well.

769
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,540
Bianzhou?

770
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
Could it be...

771
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,580
Lady Yulou?

772
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,820
Yes.

773
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,140
When arranging the seats,

774
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,180
place her

775
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,620
close to me.

776
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,900
I will.

777
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,820
I'll attend to her with care.

778
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,660
With you here,

779
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,780
I'm at ease.

780
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,420
Mother,

781
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,100
so Ehuang is coming too?

782
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,500
It's been years since I saw her.

783
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,300
I wonder how she's changed.

784
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,220
Back then,

785
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,500
I truly adored her.

786
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,940
My Lady.

787
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
I've found something out.

788
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,420
Just as you predicted.

789
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,020
There is a reason Lady Zhu

790
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,460
praised Lady Yulou so highly.

791
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,420
Turns out,
she was once betrothed to Wei.

792
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,660
My Lord always seemed so proper,

793
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,980
yet he's hiding some old affections

794
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,020
from you.

795
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,300
You can't judge by appearances.

796
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,460
My Lady, please don't be upset.

797
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,500
I'm not upset.

798
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm just thinking,

799
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
the Lord of Bianzhou, Chen Xiang,

800
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,700
has always been frail.

801
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,820
He nearly passed not long ago.

802
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,460
Many renowned physicians saved him.

803
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,820
Now Lady Yulou arrives in Yujun
for the birthday celebration.

804
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,620
It all feels rather suspicious.

805
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,100
Saved him?

806
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,820
This is just the glow before death.

807
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,060
All the elders know this well.

808
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,210
So,

809
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,780
Lady Yulou is about to become a widow.

810
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,020
A true beauty yet fated to suffer.

811
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,820
Suffer?

812
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,500
I'm afraid she's

813
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,020
unusually fortunate.

814
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,180
I've heard Chen Xiang seeks her advice

815
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,020
on many affairs in Bianzhou.

816
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,500
Of course he does.

817
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,500
After all,

818
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,100
she carries an empress's fate.

819
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,500
They say whoever marries her

820
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,180
will become ruler of the Central Plains.

821
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,140
If that's the case,

822
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,780
since Wei didn't wed her,

823
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,780
he can't claim the Central Plains?

824
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,300
Who knows what he was thinking.

825
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,500
What he thinks doesn't matter now.

826
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,620
What matters is knowing

827
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,420
what Lady Yulou's real purpose is

828
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,820
for coming this time.

829
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,580
There is Lady Yulou.

830
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,060
So noble.

831
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,900
