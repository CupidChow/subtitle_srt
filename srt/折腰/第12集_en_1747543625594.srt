1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it true that love is the only thing that can last me for the rest of my life?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel so lonely and painful when I'm fighting?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary care

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary care

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary care

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If I could just go back to the way I was

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I would embrace you and not be a cloud

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would go through the thick and thin of the fog

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I would go through the thick and thin of the fog

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only love can give me the light of the sky

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Only love can give me the light of the sky

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Episode 2

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Since you know my identity

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
why are you still standing there?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They say that the Yanzhou Shuang Shu is beautiful

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I just want to see it myself

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and taste it

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can't stand me

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There is no one in the Wei family who is good at talking

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Lord Wei knew you were a woman in the shop

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and he deliberately made a joke

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and sent the bracelet back today

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He deliberately approached the woman

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and kept the bracelet for Lord Wei

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He is too reckless

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What if he does something more evil in the future?

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What should we do?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's what I'm worried about

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How about we tell the man

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
so that he can report it to us first

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Xiaotang, this is unfair

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If the man thinks that the woman deliberately provoked their brotherly relationship

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that would be bad

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What should we do?

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I dare to tell him that I lost the bracelet

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But I really don't know how to tell him

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that his cousin is so reckless

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm leaving

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You are back, South Lord

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't worry about the bracelet

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is...

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yuzhuo found it

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Found it?

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
South Lord is right

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't have to worry about Yuzhuo anymore

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's better to get it back

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thanks to Lord Wei

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yuzhuo found it

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He found it?

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's strange

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He lost the bracelet that day

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He came again that day

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and found the bracelet again

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It seems that the bracelet is fated

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's fated

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's why he's so sad

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why didn't you tell me that you met him?

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I haven't seen him in private

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He was talking to me in the warehouse

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So I'm curious about what kind of person Lord Wei is

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to ask him

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm not interested in asking a woman to be happy

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Where did you come back from?

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I stayed in the clinic yesterday

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You are so generous

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm not generous

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm just here for fun

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Which family is this?

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm the main character

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The main character?

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why is it so boring this time?

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Shiqing

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Shiqing

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Master

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Where is he?

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shiqing said you have to go and ask him to come out

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know I've never been to a place like this

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Didn't you come here first?

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Call him out

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm here to coax girls

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm the most handsome man

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Brother, sister, brother

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's play

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Zhong Lin

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Go to the office

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Go

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Take care of Lord Wei

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Lord Wei

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go away

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Go away

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ok, ok, ok

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Since Lord Wei doesn't need it

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can go

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What are you doing?

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You know I don't like this kind of place

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And you are meeting me here

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
When will we meet?

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I want to ask you for a favor

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is it?

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You and my grandfather always persuade me to accept new things

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Recently

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I met someone I like

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Help me find her

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Really?

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Really?

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you can really accept new things

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And stay away from these things

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will help you

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's great

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Tell me

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Whose girl did you meet?

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yu Jun

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I don't know whose wife

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wife

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you kidding me?

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are so sweet

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When I need you

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will do this

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is it a favor?

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are so shameless

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How dare you say that?

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You and my grandmother

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just want to see me stay in the restaurant

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And be a good man

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You have to say something good

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And help me plan my future

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you can really accept new things

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The best woman in Weiguo

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I learned it for you

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Forget it

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I am not you

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
For power

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can be with your enemy

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can't stand this

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't understand love

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Love

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You have to get along with it

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then you will know if two people are suitable

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I am not you

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No leisure

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
On a person

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Empty

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How about this?

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Tell me

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What does this woman look like?

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't worry

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will find it for you

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And tell her

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Stay away from you

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know you are not kind

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are not kind

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Zhong Lin

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Zhong Lin

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Zhong Lin

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Shi Jun

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The jade medal of Marquis Wei has been lost

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Send to Wei's mansion

167
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Give it to the Queen

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Look at the marquis just left

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Just chase after

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just return it to him

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Am I not being considerate?

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The matter of the Wei Alliance

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Leave it to me

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I left you a secret chess

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can help you

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I will help you

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Young master, don't forget

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The real purpose of coming back to Wei

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Asked you to help me

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Not to teach me

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I dare not

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You don't think I really like that woman, do you?

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Young master, you

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you doing in the middle of the night

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I just arrived at the Luo Zhongfang

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I haven't done anything

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are so many women in Luo Zhongfang

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You don't have to be afraid of picking flowers

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You don't understand

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Every woman has her own good

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You don't understand

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Why don't I understand

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Women in Yuzhou like to stick their hair

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Women in Yanzhou like to match the orchid

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I know

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What orchid

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:53,100
I think the most favorite of women in Yanzhou is the

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You go and get some clothes

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
By the way

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If the female army comes to invite me

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You just say I have nothing to do

205
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't go back

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The female army didn't send people to invite

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Didn't invite

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The female army is busy these days

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tai Furen's birthday party

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Even the Chunniang, Xiao Tao, and Xiao Da

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm busy with people

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It turns out to be a serious matter

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Master, you can find me

214
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hello, boss

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The woman in this portrait

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
After the search

217
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If it's the wife of the Liang family

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Go tell her

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't give me a little bit of expression

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Go get clothes

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where is my jade plate

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I went to the kitchen

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll ask you

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Come back

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
impossible

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Still when I went out this morning

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You send someone out to find me

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This matter must not grow

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Especially

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can't let you know

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Niu Jun

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Niu Jun

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm busy again

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Niu Jun

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is Luo Zhongfang

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Just a wine mother sent it

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Said Nan Jun left

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Nan Jun went to Luo Zhongfang

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Luo Zhongfang

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The search is not hidden

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He's not in the main palace

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's go out and find it

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Where to find

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What to do

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Zhang Bao

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Senior search

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
crazy

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The admirer of Shi Jun

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Can you play the drum?

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't talk nonsense

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Open it

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I guess

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know who remembers

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't guess it all day

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Brother Dong

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm off

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is that Xiao Tao?

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Where is this Xiao Tao

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is two numbers smaller than Xiao Tao

263
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You look like Xiao Tao

264
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Isn't it Xiao Tao?

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hurry up

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is Xiao Tao

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Your eyes are long

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Where is this Xiao Tao

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How can it be him?

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Isn't this painted?

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You still have hair and clothes

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Still so beautiful

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And a blue grass in Yanzhou

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's Xiao Tao

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Is it Xiao Tao with blue grass?

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Why can't the people from Yanzhou be Chunyang?

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Chunyang

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm not that young

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's Xiao Tao

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If it's Xiao Tao

281
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think it's a good thing

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If Shi Jun likes Xiao Tao

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Save us a trouble

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Save this girl every time she sees us

285
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm afraid she will marry us

286
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're right

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What's wrong, Brother Dong?

288
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Didn't Shi Jun look for me?

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Is this you?

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What's wrong?

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Sorry

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I got it wrong

293
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There was still this Xiao Tao just now

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Then it really large

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What?

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
This outside

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's this?

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
A trapezius

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Entangled

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
No way

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It doesn't involve you

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
A trapezius

304
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Help department

305
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're not a ears

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's марboard

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,600
So it can eventually be called

308
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A hair

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
you take it

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,280
When did you send it?

311
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,600
The smell of wine and powder

312
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,800
The southern army went to the House of Luo

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
You must be a soldier

314
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440
Little girl

315
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm not talking about General Wei Liang

316
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,200
It's daytime, you don't go to the drill ground to train

317
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,520
Why do you run back all the time?

318
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,360
The southern army is not as close as you

319
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,160
I'm just doing my job for the master

320
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,680
What serious job can you do in the back house?

321
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
OK, OK, OK

322
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,160
Did you go out of the house these two days?

323
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,360
what happened

324
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,840
Then I went out

325
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
What's wrong with me going out?

326
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,680
OK, you men are always looking for a place to stay

327
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,120
I and the woman go out to go to the market

328
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,760
No, it's not a market

329
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,280
But you have to avoid meeting a stranger

330
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,880
What do you mean?

331
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,000
I am a rough person, I can't speak

332
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,560
But I'm good for you

333
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,560
Wei Shiqun is a stupid role

334
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,360
You should know better than us

335
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,960
Four of us brothers

336
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,240
It's all for him alone

337
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,440
Xu Taifu doesn't admit it

338
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,760
The master can't control it

339
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,200
You can't be blinded by his words

340
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't you think about moving?

341
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,840
this

342
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,960
Even you know about this

343
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,560
That's it

344
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
Then you can't blame me

345
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
What can I do?

346
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,200
Don't talk nonsense

347
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm really good for you

348
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,840
Look, I'm looking for you

349
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,120
The painting is out

350
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm looking for you

351
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,960
If you really want to marry someone

352
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,680
You pick one of us four

353
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
I pick one

354
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,200
You four have the same eyes as you

355
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,840
Is this me?

356
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,360
Isn't it you?

357
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
Isn't this a woman?

358
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,360
Not you

359
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,200
Not

360
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,080
Good-looking, Tao

361
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Look, I said it

362
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,720
It's definitely not Xiao Tao

363
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,160
You ask too much

364
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,440
Who is stupid?

365
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,200
It's not Xiao Tao who is more troublesome

366
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,320
What Senior Wei thinks is a woman

367
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,280
Then you also think of Xiao Tao

368
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,400
Don't talk nonsense

369
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,800
go

370
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,600
What?

371
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,840
Shijun went to the South Prefecture first

372
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,600
Lady King

373
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,400
At this critical moment

374
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
Absolutely not

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Need to explain to Nan Jun clearly

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,280
It's Shijun's浪荡

377
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
It has nothing to do with us

378
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,080
Nanjun

379
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,040
You go out first

380
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,520
Yes

381
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,480
What happened?

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,480
Have you woken up?

383
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't be a cat and mouse here

384
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,080
I see you wish Nanjun would be a female king

385
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
Then find a reason

386
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,920
Help us get out of the fish

387
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
Drive back to Yanzhou

388
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,120
Don't you dare to talk nonsense

389
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,720
Why go back to Yanzhou?

390
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,680
We never drove back

391
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Did you want to go back?

392
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
We didn't dare

393
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,200
Go back to Yanzhou

394
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Go back to Yanzhou

395
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,120
No way

396
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
General

397
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Please stop arguing

398
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,200
I heard you were very busy recently

399
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,440
Yes

400
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,960
I have a lot of things to do

401
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,360
You and Xiao Tao often go to the market

402
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,880
It's hard for you to buy for the birthday banquet

403
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,440
But it's not for my grandmother's birthday banquet

404
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,760
Lose some missing things

405
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
You said you were busy

406
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,600
I went to the market

407
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,560
I bought some food

408
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,600
I bought some food

409
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,200
What a coincidence

410
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,840
You search for things

411
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,280
I search for people

412
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,040
I don't know if Nanjun is successful in searching for people

413
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm pretty successful

414
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,320
I was rushed to the door and sent here

415
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,680
Why is this thing with you?

416
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,200
Jiu Niang from Luo Zhongfang sent it

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Nonsense

418
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
How could my things be in Jiu Niang's hands?

419
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
And I never go to that kind of place

420
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,880
So I can't figure out

421
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
I feel lonely recently

422
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
My things are easily taken away

423
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
And sent to someone else's hands

424
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,840
Yuzhuo also said he couldn't see it

425
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,760
As the female monarch in the mansion

426
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,800
I may not be able to manage it

427
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,440
I hope Nanjun will punish me

428
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Don't think too much if you can't figure it out

429
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,400
But I really don't know

430
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Why this thing is in Jiu Niang's hands

431
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
I don't allow outsiders to enter

432
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
Although this thing is in Jiu Niang's hands

433
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
But maybe it's not given by Nanjun

434
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,320
Who did Nanjun meet recently?

435
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,640
I haven't seen anyone

436
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
Just with Jiu Niang

437
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,400
If you say so

438
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,160
I really went to the wine temple

439
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,560
But I didn't ask Jiu Niang to accompany me

440
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,800
I always hate those

441
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,600
Nanjun went out to fight

442
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,680
It should be like this

443
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
No need to explain to me

444
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,240
Nanjun is going to show me something

445
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,120
Did I tell you?

446
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,040
You can tell me directly

447
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,120
You know clearly today

448
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,400
Why I came to you with a portrait

449
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
What are you pretending to me?

450
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,400
I said I had something to say

451
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,040
The problem is Nanjun wants to hear

452
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,800
You want to make it difficult for me today

453
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,400
How can you listen to my excuses in anger?

454
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
You just tell me directly

455
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
Why did you meet him in the bath house?

456
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,560
Why did you let him forget you?

457
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Okay

458
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,200
Then Nanjun is going to punish me

459
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,320
Or punish my cousin?

460
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,120
I

461
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,360
You think I have a brotherhood with him

462
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm afraid I will believe him

463
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,920
But have you ever thought that I am your husband?

464
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,520
I also want to hear how you explain

465
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,280
This is not a grass

466
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,200
Forget it

467
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,320
Cousin

468
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
I don't like to be afraid

469
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,520
But he shouldn't have made it

470
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,960
Intimidate brotherhood

471
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,840
I don't think so

472
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,040
I think you should be careful

473
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I think you should be careful

474
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I think you should be careful

475
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,680
Don't give me bad things

476
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,460
Father

477
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
Don't give me bad things

478
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,220
I won't allow any recall

479
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,240
invite you to 성공

480
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,780
You have to gesture

481
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,740
Don't extend my hand

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,380
Peer brotherhood

483
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,680
Wait until he greets grandma tomorrow

484
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,440
I will personally bring you over to explain to him

485
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,340
And this

486
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,960
Not your fault

487
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,280
It's just a imagination

488
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,860
Please don't blame Nanjun

489
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,680
Come on.

490
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
Your grandmother

491
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,520
has prepared all kinds of cakes

492
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,720
and is waiting for you.

493
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,800
You're still drunk.

494
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,360
I...

495
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,440
You're playing with the rules.

496
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,720
You're playing with those drunk women.

497
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,680
Isn't that too much?

498
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,040
Wang Xin.

499
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,680
Xiao Xiu.

500
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,160
Zhong Lin.

501
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Where's your grandmother?

502
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,600
She's waiting for you.

503
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
She's in the yard now.

504
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,280
Wait.

505
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,080
Let me introduce you.

506
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,800
This is Qiao Shi.

507
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,880
I learned to be happy when you were away.

508
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,080
Cousin.

509
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,680
Sister.

510
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,680
They say that when the water is red,

511
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,240
the two books are eight points apart.

512
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,240
That's not true.

513
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,240
Of course.

514
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,440
I was confused.

515
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,160
I forgot to introduce you.

516
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,920
We're officially meeting today.

517
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,600
From today on,

518
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,920
we're a family.

519
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,080
Of course.

520
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,360
But my aunt is right.

521
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,560
I just need

522
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,320
a good wife like Zhong Lin.

523
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,720
Otherwise, it's not like that.

524
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm just saying

525
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,680
I'm just drunk

526
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
because I don't have a good wife.

527
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,400
All right.

528
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
Grandmother is waiting for you.

529
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,800
Go.

530
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Grandmother.

531
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

532
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,680
Welcome, General Wei.

533
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,520
General Wei, you've been working hard.

534
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,240
The shop has prepared the leeks.

535
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
General Wei,

536
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
welcome the guests.

537
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,680
Come on.

538
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,520
Don't bother.

539
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,000
How's the progress of Yong Ning Qi?

540
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,000
Yong Ning Qi is doing very well.

541
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,880
It'll be ready in a few days.

542
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,440
It's a pity.

543
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,200
I heard that

544
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,480
the progress of the new capital is slow.

545
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
It's not slow.

546
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
It's not slow.

547
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
It's slow.

548
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
It's slow.

549
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
It's slow.

550
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
It's slow.

551
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
It's slow.

552
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
It's slow.

553
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
It's slow.

554
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,720
We have to wait for them to enter the palace

555
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
before we can go through the area.

556
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,080
The county magistrate will take me to Yong Ning Qi first.

557
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
All right.

558
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,600
General Wei, this way, please.

559
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Run.

560
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,760
Be careful.

561
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Stop.

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Good.

563
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Good.

564
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Greetings, Marquis Wei.

565
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Zhong Lin.

566
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,440
Marquis Wei, please forgive me.

567
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
I was impolite.

568
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
It's all right.

569
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,480
This is the new girl my cousin found.

570
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Yes.

571
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,040
If you like her,

572
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
I'll let you have her.

573
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Don't you think

574
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
she looks familiar?

575
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
You all leave first.

576
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,560
Zhong Lin,

577
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I think you look like

578
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
your family's Qiao Shi.

579
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
You're right.

580
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm not a girl.

581
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm a girl.

582
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm a girl.

583
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
My family's Qiao Shi.

584
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
These days,

585
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
my cousin has been back in the army for a while.

586
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
He was upset because of the lock-up.

587
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
I should have let you

588
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
and Qiao Shi meet each other earlier.

589
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Come on, I'll make up for it.

590
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Zhong Lin,

591
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
to be honest,

592
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I don't like your new wife.

593
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
She made such a scene

594
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
when she came to Wei's family.

595
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
She might not have many tricks left.

596
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
You should know

597
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
that Wei's family and Qiao's family are enemies.

598
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
You should be careful.

599
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
What happened before was a misunderstanding.

600
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
And I told her

601
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
when we got married.

602
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
I only want to be her father,

603
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
not her daughter.

604
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
But

605
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Qiao's family married her to Wei's family.

606
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
And it's not easy for them to get married.

607
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
They're both married.

608
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
How much interest

609
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
can they have in this marriage?

610
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
When did Qiao's family

611
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
make a living?

612
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
She's a little smart,

613
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
but she's a weak girl.

614
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
She's not worth it.

615
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
And she's not worth it.

616
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I easily

617
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
tricked her

618
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:39,100
in the

619
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
wedding.

620
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,500
But she's a woman of Wei's family now.

621
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
It's not up to her.

622
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
It's because

623
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
she helped me fix the famous song.

624
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
But she got Qiao's family's flag.

625
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I was so shocked.

626
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
It's not a bad thing.

627
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Brother,

628
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I know you're doing this

629
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
for Wei's family.

630
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
But

631
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I have a relationship with her

632
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
in public and private.

633
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I know what I should do.

634
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Now I'm married to her.

635
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
I hope you can treat your family well.

636
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Don't make your grandmother worry.

637
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Of course.

638
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I'll give you back what you said.

639
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
I haven't found

640
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
the person in the painting.

641
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Thank you for your help.

642
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Let's eat.

643
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I'm not eating.

644
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I have something to do in the office.

645
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I'll come with you next time.

646
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
I don't eat.

647
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
I don't play the violin.

648
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Let's drink.

649
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
General,

650
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,900
both sides have been attacked.

651
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
The lower and upper lines

652
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,900
have been filled with water.

653
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
We can only wait

654
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
for the opening of the Yongning Bridge.

655
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,900
It's officially open.

656
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Open the bridge!

657
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,900
Open the bridge!

658
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I know you're in a panic.

659
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

660
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
There is little rain water this year.

661
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
The water is insufficient.

662
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
The dry wind

663
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
causes the wheat to rot.

664
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
The crop is over half of the previous year's crop.

665
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
We have no choice.

666
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
We asked the slaves to come

667
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
to help you.

668
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
I have a cold.

669
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
I was in a panic last year.

670
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Fortunately, you gave me food.

671
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Although the price is a little high,

672
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
I can say it.

673
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
This year,

674
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
except for Yu Zhong,

675
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
the whole country is in a bad state.

676
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
If we want to lose more food,

677
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm afraid it's a little difficult.

678
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
If the famine is together,

679
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
people will not be safe

680
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
from the evidence.

681
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
There are many people who have stock.

682
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Give them some.

683
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Even if the price is higher, it won't be affected.

684
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Our army said

685
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
the master fought outside for three years.

686
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
The stock of people

687
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
has been left behind.

688
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
No,

689
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
we have been taken back.

690
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
We have found a way.

691
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Can we let the people

692
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
die by themselves?

693
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
What about Han Jin?

694
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I sent a letter to General Wei Dian

695
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
to ask him to cooperate with the grain.

696
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
He replied that

697
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
there was no grain to be lost.

698
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Wei Dian,

699
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
how long can the food of Rong Jin last?

700
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
At most a month.

701
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Okay.

702
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Are you worried about

703
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,500
the famine in Rong Jun?

704
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
You know everything.

705
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Today, I came to send Rong Junjun

706
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
to give a gift to grandmother.

707
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
People suffer and worry about it.

708
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
If you have any difficulties,

709
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
you can tell me.

710
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I can help you.

711
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Let's eat first.

712
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Don't talk about business.

713
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I heard that

714
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
the Yanzhou is located in the north.

715
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
The people there are loud,

716
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
high-pitched and rough.

717
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
It's like running through the river.

718
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Do you know why?

719
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,500
It turns out that

720
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
the people's voice is rough.

721
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
It has something to do with the food

722
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
they like.

723
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
It's really like

724
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
a water map.

725
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
It should be like

726
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
a work of art.

727
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
It's more appropriate.

728
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
You are right.

729
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
I have to go.

730
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I have to go.

731
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
I have to go.

732
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I have to go.

733
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
I have to go.

734
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I have to go.

735
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I have to go.

736
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
I have to go.

737
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I have to go.

738
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I heard that the Wei State is fond of spring wheat.

739
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Spring wheat is very resistant to drought.

740
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
It's like the people of Wei State.

741
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
They are tough.

742
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
But spring wheat is good,

743
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
but it's not high in yield.

744
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
If it's a very dry day,

745
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
it will be hard to harvest.

746
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Indeed.

747
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
That's the case.

748
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
What about the South Army?

749
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
What should we do?

750
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
We can only go to the other counties

751
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
to harvest the grain.

752
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
See if we can help the South Army

753
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
get through the difficulties.

754
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
We can harvest the grain in a short time,

755
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
but it's not a long-term solution.

756
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
The famine in Rong County comes from drought.

757
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
If we want to get rid of it,

758
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
should the South Army

759
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
build the Yongning District

760
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
southward?

761
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Build it into Rong County.

762
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
If we can ensure the irrigation,

763
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
there will be no famine in the future.

764
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
You are not thinking about

765
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
getting rid of the famine,

766
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
but the food and drink.

767
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
I don't understand what the South Army is talking about.

768
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
You know too much.

769
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
The cultivation needs a lot of manpower,

770
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
strength and wealth.

771
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
The new capital, Rong County, is far away.

772
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
If we cultivate the land,

773
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
I will not have much energy

774
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
to attack Yan State.

775
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
And the army of Rong County is near the border.

776
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
If I die,

777
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
the threat to the border

778
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
will be greater than Yan State.

779
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Isn't that what you are going to do?

780
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I didn't think so much.

781
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
With your brain,

782
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
you can only think more.

783
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
What the South Army said

784
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
is indeed what I think.

785
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
The proposal to build the canal

786
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
is indeed a selfish plan for Yan State.

787
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
The cultivation of Wey State requires a lot of manpower.

788
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
It can be said that Yan State has gained a lot of peace.

789
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
This is not false.

790
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
But if this canal is informed to the army of Rong County,

791
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
it can be used to gather the countless people of Wey State.

792
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
This is true.

793
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
If this canal is cultivated,

794
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
it can be said that Yan State has a few years of life.

795
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
But it can be used to build a great contribution to Wey State.

796
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
What you are scheming is quite simple.

797
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
But I have my own plans for this matter.

798
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
You don't have to stop me from doing it.

799
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Eat first.

800
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Mr. Shi.

801
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Is Zhong Lin here?

802
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Mr. Shi,

803
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Nan Jun is in the office of the subordinate office.

804
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
He is not in the study.

805
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Okay, I will go in and wait for him.

806
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I'm afraid it's not convenient for me to go in.

807
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
What's inconvenient?

808
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Is Zhong Lin hiding a machine in the study?

809
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Brother Liang.

810
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Xiaoxiao.

811
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
What's wrong?

812
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm afraid that I can't go in.

813
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Xiaotan, what do you do for a living?

814
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
You put people in Zhong Lin's study.

815
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
This is not Xiaotan's fault.

816
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Nan Jun said before

817
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
that if I need to get some materials and books,

818
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I can get them at any time.

819
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I don't need to ask him for help.

820
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Rong Jun Feng Wu Zhi.

821
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
You are a woman of the Qiao family.

822
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
You are so strict with our country.

823
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I am from the Qiao family.

824
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
But I still have the right to check the books.

825
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
You dare to say

826
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
that you married Zhong Lin

827
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
without hiding your personal feelings

828
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
and using Zhong Lin?

829
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Is it a coincidence?

830
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
This is my business with Nan Jun.

831
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I don't have to worry about it.

832
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
And...

833
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't forget

834
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
that the Wei family and the Qiao family are enemies.

835
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
The Wei family will not treat you as their family.

836
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
I'll leave first.

837
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Nan Jun, the situation is serious.

838
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
You should send this letter to Uncle.

839
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Yes.

840
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Is this true?

841
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
I know this person from the history.

842
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
He has the power.

843
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
He promised to give the grain to the Wei family.

844
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm sure he will give the grain to the Wei family.

845
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
The Wei family has the power.

846
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
He promised to sell the grain to us

847
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
at twice the market price.

848
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Although the grain can't relieve Rong Jun's panic,

849
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
at least it can ease the price.

850
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Thank you, Uncle.

851
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I'll let Wei Liang and the others arrange it later.

852
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Zhong Lin,

853
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,500
I don't know if I should tell you something.

854
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Please say it.

855
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Yesterday, I came to the study to find you.

856
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Now I'm free to enter the study on the ground.

857
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,500
You took the study and the antidote.

858
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I know you two are good friends.

859
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
But he is from the Qiao family.

860
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
The study is so important.

861
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
You don't want to set up a defense?

862
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
I promised him that I could go out at will.

863
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
I didn't take back the idea.

864
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
And there is no important information in the room.

865
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
It doesn't matter.

866
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
I asked Xiaotan.

867
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
I asked Xiaotan.

868
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
She said that

869
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
Rong Jun Feng Wu Zhi took the antidote.

870
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Do you know

871
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,500
he sent a letter to Yingzhou this morning?

872
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Don't worry, Uncle.

873
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
He is kind-hearted.

874
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I think you are kind-hearted.

875
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
It's so suspicious.

876
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
You don't even check it.

877
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
You can rest assured.

878
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I've read the letter.

879
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,500
It recorded some local local fengtu fish water.

880
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Including the crops that people love to plant.

881
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
The purpose is not to reveal the secret.

882
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,500
The purpose is to beg for wheat seeds in Yanzhou.

883
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Beg for wheat seeds?

884
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
The town's army is still interested in the people.

885
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
He also hopes that one day after the water supply is repaired,

886
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
the local people can plant the wheat seed.

887
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
The wheat seed is a very good seed.

888
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
If the seed is wet,

889
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
the yield will be much higher than Rong Jun's.

890
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
This way, it can be used to

891
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
relieve Rong Jun's drought.

892
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
I...

893
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I still take you as a trusted brother and sister.

894
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,500
I never thought

895
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
I would also monitor the brother and sister's situation.

896
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I am the head of the Wei State.

897
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Where did the trust come from?

898
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Of course, there will be trust.

899
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
It seems

900
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I'm too worried.

901
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
The total amount of the car is 14.

902
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,500
In total, 500 bags of grain and 700 bags of black beans are needed.

903
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Each car

904
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,500
needs to transport 12 bags of grain and 18 bags of black beans.

905
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Does that mean 10 people need to ride a car?

906
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
I need three...

907
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Who is laughing at me?

908
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Xiao Tao?

909
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Brother Dun.

910
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
What are you counting with your fingers?

911
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Do you have enough fingers?

912
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Xiao Tao, I finally met you.

913
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
You can count.

914
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Help me count.

915
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
Tell me.

916
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I need 10 people and seven horses.

917
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,500
What's wrong with 10 people and seven horses?

918
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
The master said before that you should be careful of your family.

919
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
Transporting grain is a military secret.

920
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I still can't tell Xiao Tao directly.

921
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
You're wrong.

922
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,500
It's 10 monkeys and seven pigs.

923
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
One car is needed.

924
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Each car needs to transport 12 bags of soil and 18 bags of wood.

925
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,500
In total, 500 bags of soil and 700 bags of wood are needed.

926
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,500
How many monkeys, how many pigs and how many cars are needed?

927
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Oh, right.

928
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
And the journey takes 14 days.

929
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
If you count it in one day,

930
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
monkeys need two, pigs need three.

931
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
What do monkeys eat and pigs eat?

932
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Monkeys eat soil, pigs eat wood.

933
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Help me.

934
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,500
You need 500 bags of soil and 700 bags of wood in total.

935
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
That's 400 people, 300 horses and 40 carriages.

936
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
400? 300?

937
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,500
According to the standard of military supply of the United States and Japan,

938
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,500
one person eats two meals a day, and three horses and beans.

939
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,500
It takes 112 danmi and 126 danmou to transport 14 days.

940
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,500
The soldiers of the Central Camp carry three days' food.

941
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
If the final transport is to the destination,

942
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,500
there are 412 danmou and 574 danmou of beans left.

943
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,500
These food is enough for 10,000 people to eat for three days.

944
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
But the population of the army is not enough for 10,000 people.

945
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
If the porridge is not wet, it can last for another ten days.

946
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,500
It's enough for the South Army to find other ways to support.

947
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
What army?

948
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
When did I say army?

949
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
It's monkeys, pigs.

950
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
How do you know?

951
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,500
As far as I know, the soldiers of the Central Camp march 30 miles a day.

952
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Plus the load loss, 14 days, which is to march 390 miles to 400 miles.

953
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Only Rong Jun who is in a panic is so far from the army.

954
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Do your job well.

955
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,500
You owe me a favor.

956
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,500
The master transferred these things to support Rong Jun.

957
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Take a close look.

958
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Yes.

959
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
Your Majesty, please have a cup of tea.

960
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
Xiang, make the flowers better.

961
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Okay.

962
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Xiao Zao, go get some ink.

963
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Otherwise, the color of the word is different.

964
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Master.

965
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Master.

966
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Master.

967
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
The ink of your sister is elegant and elegant.

968
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
The real thing is like a man.

969
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,500
And the ink is rich.

970
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,500
It's so natural for you and your sister.

971
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Thank you.

972
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
But my grandmother's birthday is coming.

973
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
So I'm here to do some decoration preparation.

974
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
I didn't expect to show my grudge in front of you.

975
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
I found the ink.

976
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,500
The ink is gone.

977
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
I'll go get some.

978
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
The dream is lit up by the river.

979
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,500
It's a long story.

980
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
It's like a dream.

981
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
It's like a dream.

982
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
It's like an old story.

983
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,500
It's like an old story.

984
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I have nothing to ask for.

985
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I have nothing to ask for.

986
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
