00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Novel Dramaine

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is love the only thing that can last me for the rest of my life?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel so lonely and lonely when I'm fighting?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm unable to get your ordinary care.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why do I feel so lonely and lonely when I'm fighting?

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why do I feel so lonely and lonely when I'm fighting?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My ordinary life,

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will fall again.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will be in your arms, not the wind.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will cross the vast sea of clouds.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will be born again, and I will be born again.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only love can make the sky and sea wide.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will be your hero.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will be your hero.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will be your hero.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will be your hero.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Look at the way the wolf god is fighting.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Stop!

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If it wasn't for the shot, Su Zi Xin wouldn't have made it.

21
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's just a match. Su Zi Xin is very aggressive.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's not good at fighting.

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The winner is in a moment.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This Su Zi Xin is really powerful.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This match is about fairness and justice.

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Since the weapon we prepared is not good,

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
let's change the weapon we have.

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wei Xiao.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Bring me my gun.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The latest news!

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The gunhead of the Yanzhou court was shot.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's injured.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's injured?

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Eunuch, Eunuch, why?

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's the best at shooting.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How come he's injured?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What should we do?

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't worry.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We haven't finished the match yet.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's see.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The award for the bow.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's the hope of the Wei family.

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Take the gun.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,880
The

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Aisi, you have to be careful.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't worry, Aisi.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
With the adequate protection,

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
he'll be convinced.

51
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't worry.

52
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Aisi.

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Aisi.

54
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Aisi, you can do it.

55
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
You must make it.

56
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
You must make it.

57
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Not bad.

58
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
You have to make it as well.

59
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
No, no, no.

60
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
This is the diagnosis.

61
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
He doesn't need.

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Even if I was the Especiallyble,

63
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,600
He wouldn't have been able to say otherwise.

64
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I knew he didn't,

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I keptJingxiu with him.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
It's a cross.

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
True.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
More and more.

69
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Whereas Dao Z installs many guns.

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,980
So there is an misinform.

71
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,000
Now people may think

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:12,820
Jill会

73
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,600
Wait a minute

74
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,260
yes

75
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,100
You'll be back

76
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,700
Hurry up

77
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,260
Why not

78
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,180
and our young master.

79
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,500
I have good taste.

80
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,820
Master has long been fond of the young master.

81
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,980
He's the one who's good.

82
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,140
No wonder.

83
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,740
The young master has good taste.

84
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,980
Let's go.

85
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,420
Let's go.

86
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,740
Next time.

87
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,340
The warrior of Yan State wins!

88
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,740
Good!

89
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,260
Good!

90
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,500
He's so good!

91
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,260
Good!

92
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,660
Good!

93
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,020
The young master is the best!

94
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,740
The young master is the best!

95
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,300
Others!

96
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,580
Others!

97
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,260
Others!

98
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
I think...

99
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,100
even though TAI SWORD쇄 ok über today,

100
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,700
the one who's leading the Healthcare Talisman group

101
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,060
is a sureahunched man.

102
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,540
Butterflies!

103
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,180
Your tools are shown only by Z sacrificing this hero.

104
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,780
Yes.

105
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,660
Marquis Wei, please check it.

106
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,860
The sword is sharp.

107
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,900
The internal force is going to try its best to fight.

108
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,540
But I didn't expect the rules

109
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,780
to forbid the use of dark weapons.

110
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,580
I should be fine.

111
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,420
I didn't expect to hurt Young Master.

112
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,900
Sister.

113
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,860
Marquis Wei,

114
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
I was wrong.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Zi Xin was looking for a chance to win.

116
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,860
So she lost her temper on the stage.

117
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,500
But she didn't mean to hurt anyone.

118
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,220
Marquis Wei, please don't blame yourself.

119
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,460
It's inevitable that she will be punished.

120
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,020
But I've been fighting for years.

121
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,220
I know if she meant to do it or not.

122
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,340
Su Zi Xin is not a good person.

123
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,980
If Lady Yulou doesn't teach her well,

124
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,980
she will be dragged down.

125
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,740
Wushan State hasn't attended the Lu Li Conference for many years.

126
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,820
Even if she doesn't make any contribution,

127
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,500
I believe her family

128
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,700
won't blame you.

129
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,580
Marquis Wei,

130
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,620
I came here

131
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,580
to buy something.

132
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,140
My brother is strong.

133
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,820
I'm sorry for your embarrassment.

134
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,580
But my brother came here to attend the conference

135
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,980
not to fight for Wushan State.

136
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,660
I was a female soldier in Bianzhou.

137
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,740
After my late husband died,

138
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,780
the new owner of Bianzhou,

139
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,540
the former minister of Nanrong,

140
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,660
forced Xue Tai to build his own family.

141
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,340
Xue Tai is really a rebel.

142
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,060
Chen Pang is not a rebel.

143
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,780
He can't suppress Xue Tai.

144
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,460
Except for Jue Jun,

145
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,980
he's short of many land.

146
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,860
Yes.

147
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,780
He's the only one who has 50,000 elite soldiers.

148
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,340
He has 50,000 elite soldiers.

149
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,260
I want to

150
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,620
build a new house for him.

151
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,060
I believe General Xue

152
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,620
can accomplish his mission.

153
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,700
So, Mrs. Yulou

154
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,420
has another support.

155
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,500
Xue Tai followed Mrs. Yulou.

156
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,860
If he married Mrs. Yulou,

157
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,940
he would have got tens of thousands of soldiers

158
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
to be his horseman.

159
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,900
Yes.

160
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,300
Marquis Wei, I didn't mean to lie to you.

161
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,180
But

162
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm a female soldier in Bianzhou.

163
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,940
I have my responsibilities.

164
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,620
General Xue is loyal.

165
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,180
I can't just let him go.

166
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,740
Yes.

167
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,780
It's all my fault.

168
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,220
Please don't blame me.

169
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,780
It's all your fault.

170
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,020
Mrs. Yulou made the decision.

171
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
I don't care.

172
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,380
Wait for me in Beijing.

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,700
I'll take care of all my men in Jiang filt кomras.

174
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,940
I'll ask the local Repeat Police to send 오베어

175
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,300
in town one day,

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,340
OK?

177
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,100
Gerudo

178
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,980
and I won't stay in there much longer.

179
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,660
I need you to find more people

180
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,340
for me.

181
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,420
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,220
Brother-in-law.

183
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,140
Cousin.

184
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,900
Why are Nan Zheng and Cousin here?

185
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,940
Don't they have a meeting

186
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,180
in a few days?

187
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,220
Here's the thing.

188
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,340
Cousin is worried about Qiao Ci.

189
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,740
So I brought him here.

190
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,060
Yes.

191
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,860
I do care about Ci.

192
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,180
And I'm the only one who cares.

193
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,940
It's just a scratch.

194
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,100
It's not serious.

195
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,620
You're bleeding so much.

196
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,740
You said it's not serious.

197
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,140
I had a great time today.

198
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,660
That shot was very accurate.

199
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,540
I can take it

200
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,380
after a few more rounds.

201
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
You're so mean.

202
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,660
But Qiao Ci's martial arts are really good.

203
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,700
There are not many people in Weiguo

204
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,020
who can shoot as well as him.

205
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,660
Zhong Lin.

206
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,540
Should I

207
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,500
ask Ci about it?

208
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,740
I think it's necessary.

209
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,420
Really?

210
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,140
But now

211
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,700
you have Li Kui.

212
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,140
The hunting competition in two days

213
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,020
doesn't have to be too hard.

214
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,700
Don't let your sister worry.

215
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,220
There are a few days left.

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,220
As the young master of Yanzhou,

217
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,140
you must be careful.

218
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,140
Understand?

219
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,500
Yes, brother-in-law.

220
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Lan Jun, Cousin.

221
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm here.

222
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,740
Don't worry.

223
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:55,980
Okay.

224
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,780
Have a good rest.

225
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,140
You're in the sedan chair today.

226
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,140
And you're standing up to speak for me.

227
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,580
It seems you still care about me.

228
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,020
Your brother-in-law

229
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,740
is cold and warm.

230
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,780
You're really a brother-in-law.

231
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,260
I just said

232
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,300
a few words of good words.

233
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,980
And you're so happy.

234
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,700
I didn't speak for him.

235
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,060
The gun you used today

236
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,580
is your brother-in-law's weapon.

237
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,060
I'm not his cousin.

238
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,620
Brother-in-law of Weiguo.

239
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,460
Wei Bao.

240
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,180
Really?

241
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,820
The legendary gun

242
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
is a rare rare item in the world.

243
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,380
I don't know how good the gun is.

244
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,980
I just know

245
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,660
your brother-in-law is willing to give you

246
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,780
his brother-in-law's weapon.

247
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,700
How can he recognize you?

248
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,660
You took the Li Kui today.

249
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,260
Don't be arrogant.

250
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,580
You have to be diligent every day.

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,860
And

252
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,060
do you remember

253
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,060
the thing that Xiang Hui told me to keep an eye on you?

254
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,140
Six Stars Tendon

255
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,620
One states have one step gliar Ehbreat.

256
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:14,980
Cocetaria

257
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,660
Cocetaria

258
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,300
is a rare gem in Korea.

259
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:17,460
Documents

260
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,620
Documents

261
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:30,660

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,020

We have nine thousand and six kilograms of

265
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,020
We have nine thousand and six kilograms of

266
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,020
Neum fore이에요

267
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,180
We are here to choose

268
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,700
Lu Kui and Li Kui.

269
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,980
It's not a bad choice.

270
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Why don't we take this opportunity

271
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,260
to choose another Kui?

272
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,380
Speaking of Kui,

273
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,860
it should be Mudan.

274
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,580
Chen Xiang is so lucky.

275
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
He's lucky to have a family.

276
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,260
It's a great honor

277
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,460
to have family members

278
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,580
to sing every night.

279
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,660
It's a great honor.

280
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
Madam Yu Lou is beautiful.

281
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,860
Marquis Wei is pretty.

282
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,020
If you want to choose a beauty,

283
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,420
don't lie to me.

284
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Marquis Wei is here.

285
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,020
Marquis Wei and Lord Jun.

286
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Please sit down.

287
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

288
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,040
Father.

289
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,500
Selection.

290
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,980
What do you think of Palm Leaf whooshing?

291
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,160
But...

292
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,380
It's useful to be extinguished,

293
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,680
so it can passtechnology!

294
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,400
Is it sophisticated?

295
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,160
Wipe your hands with hands

296
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,060
and they'll move lol son!

297
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,500
Its ears was frozen!

298
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,820
Chronoplasm?

299
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,480
So beautiful,

300
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
I have brought you a gift

301
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,440
Thank you for your help

302
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,800
Let's have a look

303
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Well…

304
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,800
This is the fishing map of all states

305
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,640
Well…

306
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,080
Please have a look

307
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,760
This is the newly built water canal of Wei State

308
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,080
It goes from Panyi to Rong County

309
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
The water on the way

310
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
not only solved the drought of the Han Empire

311
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,560
but also opened up 30% of the trade

312
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
to make more goods flow

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,160
It's really a great achievement

314
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
It's a big project

315
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,440
It's a good thing

316
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
So, you set up a banquet

317
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,680
just to show off to everyone

318
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,640
No

319
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,040
Today, I want to discuss

320
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,600
how to share water with states

321
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:26,960
Well…

322
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,840
What do you mean?

323
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
The land of Xiu Xu

324
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
is common in Wei State

325
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,280
But I don't want to think alone

326
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
So, I have a party

327
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
to bring out the food and wine

328
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
I want to tell you

329
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,560
only by making it smooth

330
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,280
can the state be safe

331
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,120
You mean

332
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,040
we should build the canal too?

333
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Yes

334
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
I want to connect the canal

335
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
to all four sides

336
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,120
and connect all the rivers

337
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,480
in the Central Plains

338
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,040
So, we can solve the drought

339
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,560
and the people's sufferings for a long time

340
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,840
Most of the wars in the Central Plains

341
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,920
started because of the fight for water

342
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,840
and people suffered a lot

343
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
When I went to the banquet

344
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
to investigate the Yongning canal

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,440
I saw the refugees

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,960
were all locked up and sent to exile

347
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,680
We, the high-ranking people

348
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
if we don't think about

349
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
how to solve the drought for the people

350
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
and just think about finding happiness

351
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,320
we will suffer the consequences

352
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Good

353
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,480
The drought has been going on for years

354
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,000
The people of Yanzhou are willing to live again

355
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,520
I have long wanted to

356
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,520
marry the capital to Wei

357
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,200
As long as Marquis Wei can drink water as promised

358
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,080
and enter Yaozhou

359
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,560
It sounds so fake

360
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,040
but it's actually feasible

361
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,080
It's really feasible

362
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,320
I don't know what you think of it, Lord Liangya

363
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
I don't agree

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,560
Why?

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Marquis Wei just wants to borrow the Xiuqu Yishi

366
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,680
to contain the army

367
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,320
Why should I agree?

368
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,680
To show my sincerity

369
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,280
I will dispatch troops

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,360
to help the Xiuqu

371
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,040
Marquis Wei dispatch troops to Xiuqu

372
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,680
Is it dispatch troops or Xiuqu?

373
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,280
Yes

374
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
Once the water canal is connected

375
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,080
the troops of other states will cross the waterway

376
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,760
and hit the land of Yaozhou

377
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,040
How can we resist then?

378
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,680
Right?

379
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,480
Yes

380
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes

381
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,680
It's unreasonable

382
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,720
The Xiuqu Yishi will be taken to Shangquan

383
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,160
Yes

384
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
You are thinking too much

385
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
The benefits of the canal

386
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
are not the roads between states

387
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,600
but the livelihood and peace of the people

388
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,240
A dozen years ago, Yanzhou was also a food source

389
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,640
The income depends on luck

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
When my grandfather wanted to connect the canal

391
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,320
the people of Yanzhou didn't want to cooperate

392
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,200
He swam around

393
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,400
and made the canal himself

394
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,840
After the first canal was connected

395
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,760
the people gradually understood

396
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,680
I agree

397
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,920
Recently, Marquis Wei rebuilt the Yonglin District

398
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,960
The trade between Yanzhou and Wei State has increased

399
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,960
Yanzhou has become rich

400
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
This is the biggest benefit of the canal

401
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,520
Does your words

402
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
represent Wei State or Yanzhou?

403
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
I am both the daughter of Wei Family

404
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,120
and the daughter of the Qiao Family

405
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,560
Since you are both the daughter of Wei Family

406
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,360
you must speak for the Fu Family

407
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Am I right?

408
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,280
Yes

409
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,520
Can I represent Yanzhou?

410
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,320
You?

411
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,680
Although you are young

412
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,680
you are the young master of Yanzhou

413
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,680
You are indeed capable

414
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,440
Yanzhou has been a water-saving place for a long time

415
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
It's been three years

416
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,600
The canal has just been connected

417
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,760
and the crops have just been grown

418
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
The crops have just been grown

419
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
As far as I know

420
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,080
there are tens of thousands of people every year

421
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
They are starving and are lost

422
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Why can't Yanzhou be taken away?

423
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,840
The land of Taozhou is low

424
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,760
The flood happens all year round

425
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,120
and is called a flood

426
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
Every year

427
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
the people pray for it

428
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,960
When the flood returns next year

429
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
they won't abandon their homeland

430
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,160
How can the state-owned state-owned state

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,120
bear to abandon it?

432
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,120
The people of Zhongzhou are hardworking and capable

433
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,040
They produce a lot of fruit and fruit every year

434
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,120
But due to the complex terrain

435
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,520
and the lack of trade

436
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
they have to travel across the mountains and forests

437
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,560
to send them out

438
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,880
How many people die every year because of this?

439
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,520
In this situation

440
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,240
why can't Zhongzhou be taken away?

441
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Fourteen years ago

442
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
the two families of Qiao and Wei

443
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,840
had a bloody feud

444
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,560
Marquis Wei once vowed to destroy the Qiao family

445
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,240
But why now

446
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,000
did he still decide to marry our family?

447
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
Because Marquis Wei knew

448
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,840
the people of Wei are suffering for a long time

449
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,000
In order to get rid of the Marquis Wei

450
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,800
he even let go of hatred

451
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Such a fierce and fierce man

452
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
why should you worry?

453
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
It's really a great thing

454
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
You're right

455
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
We, Yanzhou, agree to build the state-owned state

456
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,160
There are many people in Zhongzhou

457
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,440
Maybe we can get more manpower

458
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,520
We, Yaozhou, can get some money

459
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
We, Tao Zhong, also agree to build the state-owned state

460
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,320
Marquis Wei worked hard to hold the ceremony

461
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,880
and even sent his little brother to travel

462
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,120
He just wanted to take this opportunity

463
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,320
to take the state-owned state to the next level

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,520
You are willing to be controlled by Marquis Wei

465
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,880
but I can't

466
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
I will make a vow today

467
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,600
As long as I am in the state for one day

468
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,320
I will never listen to anyone else's orders

469
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,040
Marquis Wei's song is not for personal benefit

470
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm willing to write a letter to persuade Xue Tai

471
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
to ask him to help

472
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,480
Thank you for your trust in me

473
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,120
To show my sincerity

474
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,360
and to build the state as soon as possible

475
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,920
I will dispatch 100,000 elite soldiers

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,280
and 10 guards to control the water and the water

477
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
to help build the state

478
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,640
Marquis Wei is righteous

479
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,120
We are willing to help the state to build the state together

480
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,840
Thank you all

481
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,680
You are welcome

482
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,840
Goodbye

483
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,640
Si

484
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,880
Brother-in-law

485
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,560
Thank you for today

486
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,320
But my brother-in-law was too harsh on you

487
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,360
Don't mind him

488
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,160
It's okay if he treats sister well

489
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,760
I was also a bit biased against him

490
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
before

491
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
I knew it was a misunderstanding later

492
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
In Rong Jun

493
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
I almost fell off in order to save sister

494
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,160
It's right to treat your sister well

495
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Brother-in-law once alone

496
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,880
took sister back from hundreds of refugees

497
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,240
I didn't fall so low

498
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,400
Brother-in-law refused to accept the concubine for sister

499
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,200
He even turned his face to his relatives

500
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
and to make sister happy

501
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,880
he scattered all the concubines in the mansion

502
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,920
Did your sister tell you all this?

503
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,840
In this world

504
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm afraid no one can do this except me and my father

505
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,240
It's hard for your sister

506
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,200
to say that

507
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,680
But

508
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm glad to see you can be independent today

509
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,160
and think of your sister

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
Actually

511
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,160
I was afraid of being scolded by my sister just now

512
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,800
For today's words

513
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,320
Sister pulled me yesterday

514
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,920
and talked about various situations

515
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,680
I was afraid of making a joke if I recognized the wrong person

516
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,280
So I was lucky to protect them

517
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,480
Your sister told you to think of it?

518
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,080
Yes

519
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
I should have thought of her

520
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
But you are great too

521
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,680
Why are you here?

522
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
You still count that nothing happened?

523
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm done

524
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,960
A-Se told me

525
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,600
I just want to ask

526
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
how you think of those who are not

527
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,720
to praise me

528
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
A-Se is just a kid's temper

529
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,520
He had some misunderstandings about Nan Jun

530
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,880
It's good to coax him

531
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,640
But Nan Jun

532
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,480
don't blame me for making trouble

533
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,880
How could it be?

534
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,200
It's hard for you

535
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,560
I promised to help Nan Jun to get married

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
I should do this

537
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,680
Then

538
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,880
You did this

539
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,360
just because you promised me

540
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
Don't lie to him

541
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,000
Then I have to do what I promised Nan Jun

542
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,520
You told me before

543
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,920
You said that not everyone in Qiao family

544
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,520
is devoted to scheming and scheming

545
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,560
I didn't believe it before

546
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,720
But I believe it now

547
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,760
I was too narrow-minded

548
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,320
Don't blame me

549
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,840
I'm sorry

550
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,840
When we were just married

551
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
I was worried

552
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,840
But I don't know when it started

553
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,920
I don't want to hide it from you

554
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
I don't want to

555
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
I just want to treat you as my own

556
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,800
You and me

557
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,880
became close

558
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
because of a marriage certificate

559
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,560
Now I want to ask you

560
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you willing to be my real husband?

561
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,800
We've been through so much together

562
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,360
Aren't we a real couple?

563
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,400
Survivor

564
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,560
Sister

565
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,080
I found out

566
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,680
You are a master of killing.

567
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,880
He is quite capable.

568
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,120
Sister.

569
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
If you really want to marry him,

570
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,800
you should find a better man.

571
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
I want to meet him today.

572
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
I see Marquis Wei has some prestige

573
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,120
and is looking to enter the Central Plains.

574
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
But he has a family background

575
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
and is not easy to control.

576
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,880
Now the Luli Conference is over.

577
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,920
All parties will leave.

578
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,440
I have no reason to stay.

579
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,080
You mean

580
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,880
you want to find Lord Liang?

581
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,760
Leave the details of Liu Yuan.

582
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,640
Well...

583
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,200
Well...

584
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,520
The hardest thing to control is the human heart.

585
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,520
The easiest thing to control is also the human heart.

586
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,520
As long as you know what a person really wants,

587
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,760
and what he wants,

588
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,440
you can control him

589
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,120
like a puppet.

590
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,320
The invitation has been delivered.

591
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Why hasn't he come yet?

592
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,400
He was fine at first.

593
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,400
But one night,

594
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,440
His Highness went crazy

595
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
at the place where Lord Liang was.

596
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
He said

597
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
His Highness is the regent.

598
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,200
Why...

599
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
It's just an excuse.

600
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,320
They didn't come to meet me.

601
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,520
It's because I broke my face with Wei Shao.

602
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,680
None of them dared to stand up.

603
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,760
Your Highness.

604
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,080
Yanzhou sent someone here.

605
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,920
They said Zhou Mu was drunk and couldn't come.

606
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,840
Leave.

607
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,360
Yes.

608
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,120
Your Highness.

609
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,360
Zhou Mu had an emergency.

610
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,840
All the women in Zhou Mu had a fight.

611
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,960
They couldn't come to see him.

612
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,080
Is Madam Yulou not coming?

613
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,640
Don't misunderstand me.

614
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,920
I can't bear to see you alone.

615
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,600
I came to bring you back.

616
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,320
I heard that

617
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,760
you were sent to the lower realms

618
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
and grew up in Yanzhou.

619
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,000
So what?

620
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240
I'm like you.

621
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,840
I grew up in Yuzheng.

622
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
People like us

623
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,960
are not favored by our families.

624
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,760
We were given to others as pawns since we were young.

625
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,720
We never got the power of fate.

626
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,280
I came here

627
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,040
to persuade you.

628
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,080
You are a father.

629
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,240
You didn't do anything wrong.

630
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,040
You were used by them.

631
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,080
You lost your value and were abandoned.

632
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,760
You were blessed with many things.

633
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,640
You were always in panic.

634
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,520
You were afraid of being bullied.

635
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,240
The pain in your heart

636
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,240
is not something that ordinary people can feel.

637
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,680
You can feel it?

638
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,040
I was born in Wushan Kingdom.

639
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,200
I was born in a family of Su family.

640
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
When I was young, they said

641
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,680
that my birthmark was like a peony.

642
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,480
It was a fate that I didn't want for a hundred years.

643
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
These years,

644
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,120
I've been using the Ban's Mansion

645
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
to support the Su family.

646
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,160
I was careful to manage my marriage.

647
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
But until one year,

648
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,880
I suddenly found out

649
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,120
that they had a girl with seven hearts.

650
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,360
They said that

651
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,680
it was a thousand years.

652
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,400
But at that moment, I suddenly realized

653
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,800
that I was just a pawn in their hands.

654
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
As long as I lost my value,

655
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,320
I could marry her at any time.

656
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,120
What was the result of that girl?

657
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,400
She was beautiful and beautiful.

658
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,440
I have no other choice but to move out or die a letter.

659
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Mrs. Yue Luo,

660
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,720
I'll go to the toilet.

661
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
Has Madam Yuluo been to Liangya?

662
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
No.

663
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,960
Liangya has a good view.

664
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,040
After the meeting,

665
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,360
I'll take Madam to Shangwan.

666
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,040
Your Highness.

667
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

668
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,640
Liangya is not the only one

669
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,400
with a beautiful view.

670
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,520
It's late today.

671
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,040
I'll leave first.

672
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,880
I didn't mean to rely on Liangya.

673
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,440
I just want to

674
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,120
make a good relationship with Your Highness.

675
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,640
In the future,

676
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,320
if you need anything,

677
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,640
I hope Your Highness can help me.

678
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,040
Your Highness.

679
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,760
Madam Yuluo

680
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,000
just wants to

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,840
find a good picture

682
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,600
on her head

683
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,720
and never be confused by it.

684
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,920
I know.

685
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,000
She's just acting.

686
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,760
Why are you so worried?

687
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,520
She reminds me of someone.

688
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,480
Qiao Shi.

689
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,960
These days,

690
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,560
Your Highness has been with your old friend.

691
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,880
You must have a lot of time to spend with him.

692
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Just now,

693
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,960
I suddenly figured it out.

694
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,720
That day in Pan Yi,

695
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,400
why did she get angry with me?

696
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,880
Qiao Shi was born into the Qiao family.

697
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,600
She grew up in a small family.

698
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
She was loved by her grandparents and uncle.

699
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,000
Madam Ding treated her like her own daughter.

700
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Moreover,

701
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
she still has a grandchild

702
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
like Qiao Ci.

703
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,680
If it were me,

704
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,400
if I had such a family,

705
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,360
I would sacrifice for my family.

706
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,520
I would shout out

707
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
the slogan of protecting all beings.

708
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,680
But I

709
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,720
have never been protected by my family

710
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
or been bullied by my father.

711
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,040
Just like what Madam Yuluo said,

712
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
people like us

713
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
should only live like tools.

714
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,640
We can't be loyal.

715
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
If we make a mistake,

716
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,520
we will be blamed and blamed immediately.

717
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,560
Qiao Shi is a noble man.

718
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,160
She is destined to be a devil.

719
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,800
I am not born as a snake.

720
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,440
I was born

721
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,400
as a snake.

722
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,600
Madam Yuluo is also like that.

723
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Lord of Core uprising

724
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,380
Lord of Core Chef sent me

725
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,680
to deliver the food.

726
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,840
and hide.

727
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes.

728
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,920
You must be careful on the way.

729
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,000
If I knew it, I wouldn't let Yu Ru

730
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,160
return to the Kang Army.

731
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,600
And someone can take care of me.

732
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,000
I come alone.

733
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
I can leave alone

734
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
when I'm not around.

735
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,200
All right.

736
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
I'm not by your side.

737
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,040
You have to be careful every day.

738
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,480
Tell my father that I'm fine.

739
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,400
Don't worry.

740
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,400
And

741
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,600
when you go back to the city,

742
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
you must pass by Boyan

743
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,200
and leave some food and clothing for Sister Zhang.

744
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,800
It's no better than the army.

745
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,760
I've been through a lot.

746
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,640
I'll remember it.

747
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,840
Brother-in-law.

748
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,200
I entrust my sister to you.

749
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,000
If you don't treat her well

750
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,160
in the future,

751
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,840
I'll get justice for her.

752
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,560
Cousin.

753
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,280
Let's drink together another day.

754
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
It's not impossible.

755
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,160
But a place like Luo Zhongfang

756
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,960
is not allowed to be taken.

757
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,120
Do you understand?

758
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,840
Do you want to know

759
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,560
whether it's Qiao Si's horse block

760
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,760
or mine?

761
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:24,920
Let's go.

762
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,840
I'm sorry.

763
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,560
I'm sorry.

764
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
I'm sorry.

765
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,160
I'm sorry.

766
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm sorry.

767
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,640
I'm sorry.

768
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,400
I'm sorry.

769
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,240
I'm sorry.

770
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,120
I'm sorry.

771
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,920
I'm sorry.

772
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,360
Brother-in-law.

773
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,480
Sister-in-law.

774
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,280
I can accept.

775
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,240
What do you want?

776
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,280
Just do it on your own.

777
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,560
Just do it.

778
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,160
Dad said

779
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,680
there is a good news.

780
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,680
Okay.

781
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,400
Play it it.

782
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,080
Come on.

783
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,840
Play it.

784
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,080
Hurry!

785
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,920
If you let Qiu Chuling

786
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,780
find out,

787
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:43,700
I have to get

788
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,600
the whole family

789
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,420
killed.

790
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
to be with you

791
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
is the same as now.

792
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,240
But I was still young

793
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,280
and couldn't be independent.

794
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,400
Now,

795
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,240
I don't want to be

796
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,480
a puppet of anyone's plan.

797
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
For the sake of Duke,

798
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,360
Zhong Li,

799
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,440
can you let me

800
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,240
stay away from you for a while?

801
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,400
The moonlight creaks in the deep sea

802
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,200
but never comes out

803
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,200
How lucky to have always been

804
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,960
D wiring my dreams

805
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,720
ered through my fingers

806
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,400
But my heart has born the thread

807
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,520
As if a ex-girlfriend

808
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Your smile

809
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Even if it's a storm after the storm

810
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
No matter how much I don't want to live, I only miss you for this life

811
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,520
I will never forget

812
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,520
I am willing to cross the sea of mountains to follow your wind and moon

813
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,520
Waiting for the white hand to enter the first line

814
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,520
Jiangnan words are not lost in your eyes

815
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
Heart

816
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Flowing

817
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,520
I am willing to stand like a blinding smile

818
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,520
Even if it's a storm after the storm

819
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:07,520
No matter how much I don't want to live, I only miss you for this life

820
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,520
I will never forget
