=Episode 19=

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,860
Every time we go to the battle,

31
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,860
we leave them at home.

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,780
We weren't born on the same day,

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,420
and I guess

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
we won't die on the same day either.

35
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,340
But one day,

36
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,340
even if all four of us are gone,

37
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,300
burying these miniature weapons together

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,700
will mean we'll always be brothers.

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,140
So,

40
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,380
I want you to have this.

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
This...

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,380
Why are you giving it to me?

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,820
This is my most treasured thing.

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,100
I just want to give it to you.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,140
Well...

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,300
Why do you want to give it to me?

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Just keep it for me.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,820
Seeing it

49
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,860
will be like seeing me.

50
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,420
I don't want to see you at all.

51
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,380
What's going on?

52
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,580
- What's wrong?
- Let's talk.

53
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,860
- Wait.
- Let's have a talk.

54
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
What are you doing?

55
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,140
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,300
Let go of me. What are you doing?

57
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Stand there.

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,420
What is this about?

59
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,300
Someone claims

60
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,540
they have blood feuds with Yanzhou

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,580
and the feud will remain,

62
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,580
but look what happened.

63
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,020
They say they're devoted to the Lord

64
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,700
and have no intention of marrying.

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,540
Look what happened.

66
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,700
Someone...

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,580
Alright.

68
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,540
Enough about it.

69
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,580
It's my fault

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,860
for not telling you.

71
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,220
I'll accept whatever you want

72
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,060
to do to me.

73
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,580
If you ask me...

74
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,620
I'm not asking you.

75
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,900
How about this?

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,860
I'll give you all my possessions

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
and salary.

78
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
What do you think?

79
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,940
What are you saying?

80
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,180
We've been through life

81
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,380
and death together.

82
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,940
How can I have your salary?

83
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Besides, who wants your minimum salary?

84
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,380
Give me your little gold dart.

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,580
Let me keep it for you.

86
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,420
Fine, fine.

87
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,740
Xiaotao and I...

88
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,580
Who said

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,260
they'd never marry a Qiao?

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,400
She's not a Qiao.

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,380
You said you wouldn't marry
a girl from Yanzhou.

92
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
I...

93
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,180
The Lord married the Lady.

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,180
That's different!

95
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,700
How dare you mention the Lord?

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,820
He brought his bride back to Yujun,

97
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,960
but you'd be marrying into Kangjun.

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,810
Not the same at all.

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,690
- Come on.
- It's...

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,260
You're going to marry into her family?

101
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,280
Throw him into the river.

102
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,380
- Throw him.
- What? No, no.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,180
- Careful.
- Throw him into the river.

104
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,340
My Lord.

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,540
My Lady.

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,700
Isn't it the gift

107
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,260
I gave to Wei Liang?

108
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Why do you have it?

109
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,380
No.

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,820
You're mistaken.

111
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
- It's in your hand...
- My Lord.

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,620
Let's go, or the market will close.

113
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,500
So, you already knew

114
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,940
that Wei Liang liked Xiaotao.

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,940
Only slightly earlier than you.

116
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,620
No wonder

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,380
he refused to marry

118
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,500
Yuan Wang's daughter.

119
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,140
What do you think?

120
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,180
Think about what?

121
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
If Wei Liang

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,740
wants to marry Xiaotao,

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,260
would you agree?

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,260
She's from my family, after all.

125
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,020
Why wouldn't I agree?

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,500
No matter where she's from,

127
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,600
once she marries a Wei,

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,700
she's part of the Wei Clan.

129
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,340
You too.

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
My Lord...

131
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,900
What's wrong?

132
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,520
Did I say something wrong?

133
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,260
We used to doubt each other,

134
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,820
but now,

135
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,500
you're helping me with the canal.

136
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,300
What's wrong?

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,020
(Cake)
Why are you walking so fast?

138
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,180
My mother said all girls love sweets.

139
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,500
Perfect for the Lady.

140
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,900

143

and recited poems at five.

144
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,420

would you like today?

150

You might not know,

151
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,300
but we have a full range here.

152
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,180
A jade hairpin,

153
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,620
a pearl jingling hairpin,

154
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,300
and a feather-inlaid hairpin.

155
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,180
I'm sure the Lady

156
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,060
will like them.

157
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,580
Do you like these things?

158
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,740
What girl doesn't like jewelry?

159
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,740
How about this one and this one?

160
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,580
Do you like them?

161
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,500
So, you do know what I like.

162
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,060
I don't know anything about this.

163
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
These were picked out

164
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,820
by Wei Qu.

165
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,500
I thought you weren't so shallow.

166
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
My Lady, why are you back so soon?

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Did the Lord upset you again?

168
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,980
Tao, listen to me.

169
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,540
Don't talk to the Wei men anymore.

170
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,980
Well...

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,860
What do you mean?

172
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,140
All they can do is fight.

173
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,500
They're not romantic at all.

174
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,740
That's true.

175
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,100
Wei Liang gave you this?

176
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,620
Look.

177
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,540
They have the same gift-giving habits.

178
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,380
War horses and darts.

179
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,500
It's different.

180
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,100
Wei Liang said

181
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,660
this is as precious to him as his life.

182
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,620
That's why he gave it to me.

183
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,860
How thoughtful.

184
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,260
Careful, My Lady.

185
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Don't drop it.

186
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,020
How could I dare drop his gift to you?

187
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,860
You keep it.

188
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
It's not that.

189
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,460
This was a gift from the Lord,

190
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,540
so we can't drop it.

191
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,460
The Lord?

192
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
Wei Liang said

193
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,020
the four of them

194
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,860
each have a little weapon.

195
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,500
Wei Qu has a pair
of short and long swords.

196
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,860
Wei Xiao has a little gold bow.

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,780
Wei Duo has a little saber.

198
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,460
The Lord

199
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,020
especially had them made

200
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,380
based on their preferences.

201
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,500
So, the Wei men know how to give gifts,

202
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,020
and the Lord is no exception.

203
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,020
He just doesn't know how to give me one.

204
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,740
It's my fault then?

205
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,740
The Lord...

206
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
My Lord.

207
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,140
You didn't even wait for me.
Why walk so fast?

208
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,200
Here.

209
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,740
You've been in the army for years,

210
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,100
so you always walk fast.

211
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,380
I have to walk faster to keep up.

212
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,740
That's not necessary.

213
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,740
You picked out all the presents.

214
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,980
I've brought them back for you.

215
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,860
They're just local gifts

216
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,260
for Grandmother and Mother.

217
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,260
Still, thank you, My Lord.

218
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,620
These are for Grandmother and Mother?

219
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,380
I thought they were for you.

220
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
I don't need them.

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,620
I have those 500 war horses, right?

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,460
I knew

223
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,380
you'd like the war horses too.

224
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,740
We'll return to Yujun early tomorrow.

225
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,560
Take some time to rest.

226
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,820
There are still a few things
to wrap up about the canal.

227
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,860
I'll go to work.

228
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,220
Since you say these

229
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,860
are all for Grandmother and Mother,

230
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,780
then consider it

231
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,940
something I picked for you.

232
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,220
It's better than war horses.

233
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
See?

234
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,860
He still

235
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,220
learned something.

236
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,140
I just need to try a little harder.

237
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,260
But we're leaving

238
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,380
for Yujun tomorrow.

239
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,460
What? You don't want to go back?

240
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,860
It's not that.

241
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,460
I just don't want to waste my efforts.

242
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,500
Go bring Yang Feng to me.

243
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,820
Yes.

244
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,100
(Boya, Yanzhou, General's Mansion)

245
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,820
Fan.

246
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,740
What do you want?

247
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Nothing.

248
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm just used to snacking on sour plums

249
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,860
when I do needlework.

250
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,740
It's nothing.

251
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,220
My Lord.

252
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,140
How improper.

253
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,820
I'm not even going to bother with you.

254
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,580
My Lord,

255
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,780
the Lady will be ready shortly.

256
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,100
How troublesome.

257
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,140
Generals.

258
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Thank you for this.

259
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
It's my duty.

260
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,550
- He's still unreliable.
- As for the canal,

261
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,990
- It's been years.
- I do have some experience.

262
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,620
Look at how ingratiating he is.

263
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,780
You two,

264
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,980
enough already.

265
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,340
It's as if he'd get promoted.

266
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,460
Wei Liang.

267
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,690
- Come.
- My Lord.

268
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,220
Let me ask you.

269
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,220
Why did you give away

270
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,780
the little gold dart from me?

271
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,020
My Lord.

272
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,660
You refused Yuan Wang's daughter

273
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,220
because you like Xiaotao.

274
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,740
Why didn't you tell me?

275
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
I was afraid you wouldn't approve.

276
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,460
But you still like her even so?

277
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,780
I couldn't help it.

278
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,780
Five years ago,

279
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,620
when we retook Yunzhong,

280
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,940
you stayed still
even the when fire burned your back

281
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,660
just to stay hidden.

282
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,740
And now you can't help it with this?

283
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,140
It's true.

284
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,380
Every time I'm working in the office,

285
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,140
I can't stop thinking about her.

286
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,420
Whenever there's something
delicious or interesting,

287
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,340
she's the first one who comes to mind.

288
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,100
When she's upset,

289
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,620
I lose sleep for nights.

290
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,860
When she's happy, I'm happy.

291
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,140
When she's sad, I'm sad too.

292
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,220
I just can't help it.

293
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,620
They say

294
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,660
even heroes fall for belles.

295
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,500
You're no exception too.

296
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
My Lord,

297
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,540
feelings are complicated.

298
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,900
You've never been in love,

299
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,220
so you don't understand.

300
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,740
My Lord,

301
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,380
what do you mean by "too"?

302
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,460
Right.

303
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,660
You're right. I don't understand.

304
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,860
Good thing we haven't left yet.

305
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,160
The prefect is right over there.

306
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,100
I'll go tell him now

307
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,260
I approve of the marriage.

308
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,140
Stay and get married.

309
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,260
No, no. My Lord.

310
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,020
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

311
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,740
My Lord.

312
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,700
My Lord.

313
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,740
Since you're ready,

314
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,780
let's depart then.

315
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,460
Everyone,

316
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,620
I'll leave the Yongning Canal

317
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,660
to your care.

318
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,020
We'll do our best.

319
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,980
Let's go.

320
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
This is bad.

321
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,740
Very bad.

322
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,740
Tell me. What happened?

323
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,910
What's wrong?

324
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,020
I have a copy of The Waterway Classic,

325
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,140
which records rivers and tributaries.

326
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,260
I should've brought it
to help with the canal.

327
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
But

328
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
my useless brain...

329
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,990
I completely forgot.

330
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,100
Forgot?

331
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,020
How could you forget?

332
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,500
It's a miracle you even remembered

333
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,780
to bring yourself.

334
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,260
I shouldn't have troubled you, My Lord,

335
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,100
but this book

336
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,300
concerns our schedule.

337
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,700
So, I must ask you

338
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,500
to fetch it for me.

339
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,940
You're so phony.

340
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,420
If you truly wanted to help
with our canal,

341
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,940
how could you forget it?

342
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,820
Shut up.

343
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,020
Do you truly care?

344
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,100
My Lord.

345
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
It's fine.

346
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,980
It's not a big deal.

347
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,740
I'll send someone

348
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,420
to Panyi to retrieve the book for you.

349
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,780
Why not

350
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,220
go with us?

351
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,740
That would be ideal.

352
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,300
If you can handle it personally,

353
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,740
that'll be perfect.

354
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,580
Hold on.

355
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,740
Are you sending the Lord of Wei

356
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,900
all the way to Panyi

357
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,180
just to fetch a book?

358
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,500
Lord Zhen, don't rush.

359
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,900
On the way to Panyi,

360
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,740
we'll follow the waterway.

361
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,500
We can check progress

362
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,020
on the later phase of the canal

363
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,980
and also revisit old places.

364
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,300
Besides, we can retrieve the book.

365
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,020
That's a triple win.

366
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,740
Just as the Lady said,

367
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,460
that's why I dared ask you to go.

368
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,060
My Lord, what do you think?

369
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,660
Last time,

370
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,020
we did a lot in Panyi.

371
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,660
I'd like to go back too.

372
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,660
Alright.

373
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,660
Let's do as the Lady says.

374
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,740
Let's go to Panyi.

375
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,740
Thank you, My Lord.

376
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,900
Let's go.

377
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,740
You get in the carriage first.

378
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,060
Did you see that, My Lady?

379
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,540
Just now, the Lord was staring at you

380
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,940
as if he was captivated.

381
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,060
(Boya, Yanzhou)

382
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,020
(General's Mansion)

383
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,900
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

384
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,780
My Lady.

385
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,020
My Lady.

386
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,100
Bi Zhi.

387
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,300
Bi Zhi.

388
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,260
Can you hear me?

389
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,220
Xing, fetch the physician.

390
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,060
Yes.

391
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
Were you picking sour plums for me?

392
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,780
Two days ago, the general asked

393
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,300
where sour plums grow.

394
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,740
I told him

395
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,780
Mount Bang.

396
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,460
But he collapsed at the city gate.

397
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,020
Maybe he fell and got hurt

398
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,940
while picking.

399
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,740
This is a blade wound.

400
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,260
It must've been Xue Tai.

401
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,260
Mount Bang is near Boya's border.

402
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,300
Xue Tai often patrols there.

403
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,020
We'll ask the general once he wakes up.

404
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,180
Hurry, carry him inside.

405
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,140
Yes, hurry.

406
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,460
(General's Mansion)

407
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,780
You're awake.

408
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,180
Fan.

409
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
Don't move.

410
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,780
Fan, I want to sit up.

411
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,100
Does the wound still hurt?

412
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,340
Were the sour plums

413
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,740
good?

414
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,260
It's fine if they weren't.

415
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,980
Next time,

416
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
I'll find another tree

417
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,260
and pick more for you.

418
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,700
I haven't eaten them yet.

419
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,020
Then try one.

420
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,020
Try it.

421
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,340
Is it...?

422
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,340
Is it not good?

423
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,740
If so,

424
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,420
don't eat them.

425
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,700
It's good.

426
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,580
It's very good.

427
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,660
I don't want sour plums anymore.

428
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,940
I just want a peaceful life with you.

429
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
Fan,

430
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,820
aren't we already living that way?

431
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,220
This

432
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,540
was just an accident.

433
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,300
I promise

434
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll be careful next time.

435
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,180
Xue Tai won't catch me again.

436
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,540
If you were just a common man,

437
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,200
you wouldn't need to worry
about Xue Tai.

438
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,460
But you're the Commander of Boya Forces.

439
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,470
That's why

440
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,660
it's so dangerous.

441
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,740
Let's leave, Bi Zhi.

442
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,900
Fan,

443
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,260
I never wanted to be the commander.

444
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,700
I only wanted to give you

445
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,740
a stable home and a happy life

446
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,940
in this chaotic world.

447
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,980
Other people's lands

448
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,420
will never be as safe as our own.

449
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
And

450
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,740
more importantly,

451
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,220
I want the Lady

452
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,580
and your family's

453
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,100
approval.

454
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,700
I think you'll truly be happy that way.

455
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,340
Alright.

456
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,020
If trouble keeps coming,

457
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,780
then we'll make them too scared to try.

458
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,780
If we can win over

459
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,260
the Qiaos and Weis

460
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,050
and let all know you're my husband

461
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,560
and the Lord of Wei's cousin-in-law,

462
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,020
they wouldn't dare act again.

463
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,420
Alright.

464
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,820
No more tears.

465
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,180
My Lord.

466
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,580
You don't need to do this every time.

467
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
I'm used to eating and sleeping
with the soldiers.

468
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,100
I just wanted to share it with you.

469
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,420
But this is coarse food.

470
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,900
Do you want this?

471
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,860
My Lord,

472
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,100
the road ahead is blocked.

473
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,020
What should we do?

474
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,220
I'll go check.

475
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,580
You eat first.

476
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,260
It's cold here.

477
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,220
Get in the carriage.

478
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,340
Xiaotao, help the Lady in.

479
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,120
Since you like this pancake,

480
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
have more.

481
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,540
Go back to your job.

482
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,430
Sure. Let's go.

483
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,140
Tao,

484
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,580
take the pancake.

485
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,540
Eat it first.

486
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,540
No need to wait for me.

487
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,900
Who's waiting for you?

488
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,940
Why did you give me this anyway?

489
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,740
The Lord said you wanted it.

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,850
Oh, please.

491
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,260
What can you learn from him?

492
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,260
How clueless.

493
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,580
What did I do now?

494
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,980
How did I upset you this time?

495
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,700
You didn't upset me.

496
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,180
You offended the Lady, didn't you know?

497
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,180
Can't you tell?

498
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,500
It's obvious.

499
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,100
The Lady wants to get closer
to the Lord.

500
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,180
Can't you decide to change the route?

501
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,260
Did you have to call the Lord away?

502
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,540
I don't care.

503
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,900
You caused this mess.

504
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,220
You deal with it.

505
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,180
Fine.

506
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,660
I'll take care of it.

507
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,740
It's on you.

508
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,780
Bye.

509
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,100
Come back.

510
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,260
It's on you.

511
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,900
Not on us.

512
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,740
You promised her.

513
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,780
You figure it out.

514
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,620
Let's go.

515
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,780
Come back.

516
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,980
The Lord is slow-witted.

517
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,740
What are you thinking to expect him

518
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,060
to read the Lady's mind?

519
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Are you even a brother?

520
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,740
Are we brothers?

521
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,220
Didn't we say we share

522
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,500
blessings and hardships?

523
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,580
And now you chicken out
over a small problem?

524
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,700
It's not life or death.

525
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,060
You can handle this.

526
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,900
Let's go.

527
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,860
Come back.

528
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,780
One month's salary.

529
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,820
Fine, three months.

530
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,220
Kids

531
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,420
are not up for this.

532
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,020
Take him to play over there.

533
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,620
Don't move.

534
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
Come here.

535
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
Let's go.

536
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,320
What bad idea that I can't hear

537
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
are you cooking up now?

538
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,780
Back when I frequented taverns,

539
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,900
there were always tavern maids

540
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,100
fighting over me.

541
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,820
Now the Lady and the Lord

542
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,340
need someone like that.

543
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,980
You'll go

544
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,540
and make the Lord jealous?

545
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you want me dead?

546
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,820
What's your point?

547
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,740
Listen carefully.

548
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,060
We need to be cruel now.

549
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,420
The best way to make someone

550
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,540
realize their feelings

551
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,980
is to make them feel loss first.

552
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,100
Think about it.

553
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,780
If Xiaotao suddenly went missing,

554
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,980
how would you feel?

555
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,740
Worried, heartbroken, and upset.

556
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,300
What a love expert.

557
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,660
Does the Lord have any orders?

558
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,260
The Lord told me to ask you

559
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,220
to wait here.

560
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,820
We'll guard you here.

561
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,780
Please.

562
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,500
Stay and guard here.

563
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,540
Guard here.

564
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,540
Wait here.

565
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,980
My Lord.

566
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,940
My Lord!

567
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,500
The Lady...

568
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,220
The Lady...

569
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,160
What's wrong with her?

570
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,340
She said she'd been sitting too long

571
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,260
in the carriage,

572
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,100
feeling suffocated.

573
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,600
She insisted on going out for a walk.

574
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,260
Does she have guards?

575
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,540
Wei Liang and Wei Duo are there.

576
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,820
Then it's fine.

577
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,910
But she hasn't come back even now.

578
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,580
She probably felt stifled
in the carriage

579
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,940
and went out to relax.

580
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,060
This march is dull.

581
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,740
Now that Wei Dian is gone,

582
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,780
her burden's lifted.

583
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,200
Let her enjoy herself a bit.

584
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,700
Why are you back?

585
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,660
- What's up?
- Why aren't you with the Lady?

586
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,780
My Lord,

587
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,620
the Lady wanted to fetch some water

588
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,580
and sent me back to ask

589
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,260
whether to fetch creek water or dew.

590
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,660
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,940
This is the wilds.

592
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,700
How could you leave the Lady alone?

593
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,780
- Wei Duo...
- Wei Duo?

594
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,260
Wei Duo is not even as capable as Tao.

595
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
How can you count on him?

596
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,220
This is the wilds with complex terrain.

597
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,260
Wild beasts could appear.

598
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
You're sending the Lady
to the tiger's den!

599
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,980
Even if we ignore that,

600
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,660
what if bandits want her for her looks?

601
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,070
What if refugees starving

602
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,940
from war

603
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,020
treat her like food?

604
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,780
Haven't you heard these stories?

605
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,740
If anything happens to the Lady,

606
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
you owe your life in apology.

607
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,900
My Lord, I'll teach him a lesson.

608
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,020
My Lord.

609
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,420
What's going on with you today?

610
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,060
She just went for a walk.

611
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,260
Isn't Wei Duo with her?

612
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,780
But it's been so long.

613
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,900
The Lady...

614
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
Fine.

615
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,660
I'll go find her.

616
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,020
My Lord, please.

617
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,740
You made it too terrifying just now.

618
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,780
If I hadn't, would the Lord be worried?

619
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,220
But you can't just jump
to the worst case.

620
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,580
She won't really go missing.

621
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,180
Wei Duo's with her, after all.

622
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,260
That's true.

623
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,900
What are you two whispering about?

624
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,360
- Wei Duo.
- Wei Duo.

625
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,500
Where's the Lady?

626
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,300
Where is she?

627
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
The Lady?

628
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,420
Isn't she with you?

629
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,260
Oh no, you didn't clean your ears.

630
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,420
Wei Duo.

631
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,900
Yes.

632
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,100
Where's the Lady?

633
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,100
Oh, my god.

634
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Where's the Lady?

635
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,740
Go look for her!

636
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
Over here!

637
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,140
Hyah!

638
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,160
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

639
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,460
Take them down.

640
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
Yes.

641
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,900
Come here.

642
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,780
Spare me, General.

643
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,940
Spare me, General.

644
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,500
Xiaotao, are you okay?

645
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,980
Who are you trying to take down?

646
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,020
- What's wrong?
- Xiaotao?

647
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,260
I'm fine.

648
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,900
Do something useful.

649
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,780
Take these people

650
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,980
to see the physician.

651
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,180
Some are sick.

652
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,100
How did you know I was here?

653
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,660
Are you okay?

654
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,580
What could happen to me?

655
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,100
I saw these refugees

656
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,980
lost in the woods.

657
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,260
They got separated

658
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,540
from their countrymen

659
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,460
while looking for food.

660
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,700
It was getting dark,

661
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,180
so I had the guards help us

662
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,220
find the way here.

663
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,420
They didn't abduct you?

664
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,060
No.

665
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,740
Go.

666
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,180
Let's go.

667
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,100
Wei Qu.

668
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,780
Where are you from?

669
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,500
Where are you headed?

670
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,740
General,

671
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,540
we came from Yenzhou.

672
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,980
This year's rain

673
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,180
was less than usual,

674
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,820
so Yenzhou and Yaozhou

675
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,660
fought over water

676
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,500
constantly.

677
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,740
Hundreds in our village
were forced to flee.

678
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,460
Only these few

679
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,020
made it this far.

680
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,100
General.

681
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,340
Here.

682
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,140
(From Yenzhou)

683
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,020
Yenzhou is over a thousand li away.

684
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
Did you walk all the way?

685
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,020
We had no choice.

686
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,540
We went to Liangya,

687
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,580
but they wouldn't take us in.

688
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,420
Then we tried Yanzhou.

689
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,980
They wouldn't take us either.

690
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,980
Yes, General.

691
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,140
We're exhausted,

692
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,660
so we just wanted

693
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,860
to find a safe place here

694
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,460
to build huts through the winter.

695
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,380
When spring comes, we'll move on.

696
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Please, General, be merciful.

697
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,020
Don't drive us away.

698
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,820
Yes. Please don't drive us away.

699
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,300
We're not trying to expel you.

700
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,980
But the soil here

701
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,820
isn't good for building houses.

702
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,300
Where should we go then?

703
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,620
Please, General.

704
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,500
General.

705
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,420
- Help us.
- Please, General.

706
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
General, please help us.

707
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,060
- Please help us.
- Please, General.

708
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,980
Please help us.

709
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,140
General, please help us.

710
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,500
There's a place 20 li north,

711
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,790
bordering Panyi to the north
and Xindu to the east.

712
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,900
The soil there is good for building.

713
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,420
Besides,

714
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,940
it's close to the Yongning Canal.

715
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,060
Water is accessible.

716
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,380
You can clear the land, farm,

717
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
and make a living there.

718
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,660
If you promise that starting today,

719
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,020
you'll obey the law of Wei

720
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,200
and won't harm the people,

721
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,820
Wei will take you in.

722
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,500
You can drink Wei's water

723
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,660
and eat Wei's rice

724
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,220
just like ordinary citizens.

725
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,580
Thank you, General.

726
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,300
Thank you.

727
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,380
But

728
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,300
when we passed Panyi,

729
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
the mayor was away on business.

730
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,460
Without his approval,

731
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,500
we dared not stay outside the city.

732
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,500
Settling down there

733
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,140
won't be easy.

734
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,020
You're not dealing

735
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,940
with an ordinary general

736
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,140
but the Lord of Wei.

737
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,940
My Lord.

738
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,020
Thank the Lord.

739
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,420
Thank you, My Lord.

740
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,380
Thank you, My Lord, My Lady.

741
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,620
Thank you, My Lady, My Lord.

742
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,820
Thank you, My Lord.

743
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,500
- Get up now.
- Thanks, My Lady.

744
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,220
Come back to camp with us

745
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,020
for shelter and food.

746
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,580
We'll head to Panyi tomorrow morning.

747
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,220
Thank you, My Lady.

748
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,340
Thank you, My Lady, My Lord.

749
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,700
Thank you, My Lord.

750
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,180
Great.

751
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,700
The wandering days are over.

752
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,500
(Wei)

753
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,060
Where are you going?

754
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,100
There's no water left.

755
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,500
I'll get some water.

756
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,340
No need.

757
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,970
- Guards.
- Yes.

758
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,890
- Bring water.
- Yes.

759
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,380
Drink up.

760
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,100
Where are you going?

761
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,900
It's cold at night.

762
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
I'll get more clothes from the carriage.

763
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,620
No need.

764
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,580
Cover yourself with this.

765
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,420
You need it.

766
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,700
It's okay. Just cover yourself.

767
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,600
Here, cover yourself.

768
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,140
Come on.

769
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,170
- I need to change.
- No.

770
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,660
Sit down.

771
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,860
What's wrong today?

772
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,220
You're opposing me everywhere.

773
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,820
I don't care. I'm changing now.

774
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,660
No.

775
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,780
I'm telling you.

776
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,220
Starting today,

777
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,060
you must tell me where you're going.

778
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,060
You can't make us worry
like today anymore.

779
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,100
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

780
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,460
Chunniang did worry about me.

781
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,020
She nagged me a lot.

782
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,660
The one who worried most about you today

783
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,740
is not Chunniang.

784
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,780
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

785
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,820
Good.

786
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,020
Very good.

787
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,900
This one.

788
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,140
(Yao Ying'e, eldest daughter)
She's pretty,

789
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,660
but she's too old

790
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,980
to be offered to the Lords.

791
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,220
Yes.

792
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,780
(Li Su, eldest daughter)
She can sing and dance,

793
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,140
but she's famously awkward with words.

794
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
Yes, yes.

795
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,460
My Lord.

796
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,300
What do you think
of Lord Xu's second daughter?

797
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,960
(Xu Fanjing)
She has peachy cheeks

798
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,390
and a captivating smile.

799
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,900
Also, Lyu's youngest daughter

800
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,820
is skilled in four arts
and is well-known.

801
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,220
If we can find her,

802
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,300
(Lyu Xiaojun)
she'll be a great gift.

803
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,420
Finding her

804
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,180
won't be easy.

805
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,340
It might be too wasteful.

806
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,500
My Lord,

807
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,380
this is for the good of the realm.

808
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,100
Besides, you have no children.

809
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,420
What's wrong
with having a marriageable woman

810
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,940
as your concubine?

811
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,580
Concubine?

812
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,220
Yue,

813
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,900
how can you order

814
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,220
a search for belles everywhere

815
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,460
to be your concubines?

816
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,020
What are you saying?

817
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,140
I'm no young man anymore.

818
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,980
I...

819
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,660
I just want to find some young girls,

820
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,580
nurture them,

821
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,300
and marry them to the Lords.

822
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,620
You've benefited from marrying off

823
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,300
two girls, haven't you?

824
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
I'm thinking for the whole realm.

825
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,500
When Lord Qiao Gui was alive,

826
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,180
he never had this idea.

827
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,940
You're just a woman; be quiet.

828
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,860
You...

829
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,620
Lady Ding.

830
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,460
Yue,

831
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,900
you've gone too far this time.

832
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,460
Ci and Manman's birth mother
passed away early.

833
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,340
These years,

834
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,980
it's Lady Ding who's been
managing the household

835
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,820
and raising these three children.

836
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,900
Even Father

837
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,540
respects her deeply.

838
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,100
How can you scold her this way?

839
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,300
I already said.

840
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,420
This is not about concubines.

841
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,980
I didn't say it.

842
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,900
It's him.

843
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,380
It's him who said it.

844
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,420
Ping,

845
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,620
I'm doing this for our family

846
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,460
and for Yanzhou.

847
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,400
Since Manman married into Wei,

848
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,160
our relationship has clearly improved.

849
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,500
Clearly, marriage alliances work.

850
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,300
Ping,

851
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,780
right now,

852
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,220
Liangya, Juejun, and other states

853
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,500
are expanding their armies.

854
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,540
The world is on the brink of chaos.

855
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,700
I wish our family

856
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,820
had more daughters to marry off.

857
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,220
Uncle, aren't you afraid

858
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,620
you'll be laughed at for doing this?

859
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,620
If Yanzhou uses girls to curry favor,

860
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,020
it's a disgrace to men.

861
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,620
If that's really done,

862
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,940
how can I face anyone

863
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,460
as the future Governor of Yanzhou?

864
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,140
- Ci.
- Yue.

865
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,020
How can you be so confused?

866
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,500
You must be misled by him.

867
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,020
- Ping.
- I'll expel you right now.

868
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,140
My Lord, this...

869
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
Ci.

870
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,940
Mr. Zhang is our aide.

871
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,020
You'll need him in the future.

872
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,340
Does he deserve that?

873
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,040
My Lord,

874
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,220
since Young Master Ci doesn't trust me,

875
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,180
I'll pack up

876
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,500
and retire.

877
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,560
You don't have to leave.

878
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,660
I'm going now to pack

879
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,020
and leave this filthy place.

880
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,180
What nonsense is this?

881
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,540
Ci.

882
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,220
- My Lord, you...
- Enough, Mr. Zhang.

883
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,660
Don't make it worse.

884
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,660
I...
