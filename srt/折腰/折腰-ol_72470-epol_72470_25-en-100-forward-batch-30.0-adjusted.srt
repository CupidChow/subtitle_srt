00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,020
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou)

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,060
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou;
Su Zixin, Wushan State)

32
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,570
He's good.

33
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,610
Young Master Ci's weapon
isn't quite handy.

34
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,730
Stop.

35
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,730
If he hadn't lost the spearhead,

36
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,980
then Su Zixin

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,100
might not have gotten close.

38
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,450
It's just a match.

39
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,660
Su Zixin struck fiercely

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
with no regard for honor.

41
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,260
Victory or defeat happens in an instant.

42
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,690
Su Zixin is truly bold.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,410
In a duel in the arena,

44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,690
what matters is fairness and justice.

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,540
Since the weapon we prepared isn't good,

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,690
change it to one that suits you

47
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,970
and fight again.

48
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,410
- Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,940
Bring me

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,860
- my treasured spear.
- Yes.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,340
Latest report:

52
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,780
Qiao Ci from Yanzhou

53
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,010
lost his spearhead

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,260
and was wounded.

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,500
Wounded? Then...

56
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,610
- Brave choice.
- Why?

57
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,410
Isn't he best at using the spear?

58
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,850
How could he get hurt?

59
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,980
What to do?

60
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Don't worry.

61
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,540
The match isn't over yet.

62
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,610
Let's wait and see.

63
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Bogong's spear...

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,810
You're our family's hope.

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,210
Take the spear.

66
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,580
(Peace and Prosperity)

67
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,340
Ci, be careful.

68
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,340
Don't worry.

69
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,370
This time, I'm well prepared.

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,020
He'll have to admit defeat.

71
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,210
Rest assured.

72
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,020
Good for Qiao Ci.

73
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,610
Watch out!

74
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,850
Is it over?

75
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,850
Yes.

76
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,220
What's the result?

77
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,050
He won!

78
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,310
Yanzhou won!

79
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,540
Yanzhou won!

80
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,780
That's great!

81
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Who just said Yanzhou couldn't win?

82
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,380
Pay up.

83
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,410
You lost.

84
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,170
Don't look down on Young Master Ci.

85
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,290
- It's all yours.
- Wow, we won so much.

86
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,490
Exactly. What a poor judgment.

87
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,780
Duang, your judgment was spot on,

88
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,910
betting on Young Master Ci.

89
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,140
It wasn't me.

90
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,460
The Lord had his eye on him long ago.

91
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,610
He's the one with vision.

92
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,810
No wonder.

93
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,370
The Lord has a good eye too.

94
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

95
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,780
We'll bet again next time.

96
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,980
The warrior from Yanzhou has won.

97
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,140
Good!

98
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,700
- Good!
- Well done!

99
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,580
- Mr. Qiao.
- Excellent!

100
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,290
- Good!
- Well done!

101
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,890
- That was brilliant!
- How impressive!

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,540
Young Master Ci is impressive!

103
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,370
In a duel,

104
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,950
no malicious moves are allowed.

105
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,220
Su Zixin,

106
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,130
you tried to harm your rival
with a hidden weapon.

107
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,850
Is this the kind of conduct

108
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,130
taught in Wushan?

109
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,980
Su Zixin

110
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,420
tried malicious means.

111
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,940
His qualification
for further matches is revoked.

112
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,010
My Lord,

113
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,180
weapons are blind.

114
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,880
In the arena, one must go all out.

115
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,850
I simply didn't expect
that using hidden weapons

116
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,130
was against the rules.

117
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,890
I thought it was okay

118
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
but never thought

119
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,830
I'd end up hurting Young Master Ci.

120
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,330
Ehuang.

121
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,260
My Lord,

122
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,730
I failed in teaching him.

123
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Zixin was

124
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,420
too eager to win

125
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,490
and lost his composure on stage.

126
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,100
But he had no intent to cause harm.

127
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,460
Please

128
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,770
don't blame him.

129
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,010
Sparring comes with bumps and bruises,

130
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,530
but I've fought many battles.

131
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,460
Whether it was intentional or not,

132
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,850
I can tell.

133
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,890
Su Zixin is crooked.

134
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,650
Lady Yulou,
if you don't keep him in check,

135
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,490
he'll only drag you down.

136
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,340
Wushan hasn't joined
the Deer Hunt for years.

137
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,460
Even if you return without success,

138
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,130
I believe your family

139
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,340
won't blame you.

140
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
My Lord,

141
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,220
actually, I haven't told you

142
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,380
the whole reason why I came.

143
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,770
My cousin acted poorly.

144
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,420
Sorry about that.

145
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,180
But we came to this event

146
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,940
not to seek glory

147
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,580
for Wushan.

148
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,820
(Xue Tai, Juejun)

149
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,770
I was once the Lady of Bianzhou.

150
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,820
After my husband passed,

151
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,730
the new lord of Bianzhou

152
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,490
couldn't tolerate his old subordinates,

153
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,340
forcing Xue Tai

154
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,770
to go independent.

155
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,420
Xue Tai has indeed rebelled.

156
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,100
It's not that Chen Pang
couldn't tolerate Xue Tai.

157
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,580
He just couldn't suppress him.

158
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,530
Besides Juejun,

159
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,010
he's seized quite a few territories too.

160
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,980
Yes.

161
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,420
He alone controls Juejun,

162
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,890
commanding 50,000 elite troops.

163
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,890
This time,

164
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,250
I came to find him a new master.

165
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,700
I believe General Xue

166
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,250
will achieve great things.

167
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,250
So, Lady Yulou

168
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,980
has powerful support behind her.

169
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,010
Xue Tai follows Lady Yulou.

170
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,650
(Xue Tai, Juejun)
If someone marries Lady Yulou,

171
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,420
wouldn't they get Xue Tai's troops

172
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,630
as a dowry?

173
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,660
Exactly.

174
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,220
My Lord,

175
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,730
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

176
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,610
However,

177
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,580
as the Lady of Bianzhou,

178
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,250
I have duties to fulfill.

179
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,340
General Xue

180
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,130
is loyal and steadfast.

181
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,530
I can't abandon him.

182
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,260
Yes.

183
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,490
What happened today

184
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,130
is my fault alone.

185
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,610
My Lord, please don't blame my cousin.

186
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,250
Whom you befriend

187
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,420
is entirely up to you, Lady Yulou.

188
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,370
I don't care.

189
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
A few days later,

190
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,800
I'll be hosting a feast for the lords.

191
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,300
Send off the invitations for me.

192
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,730
Be sure to send one

193
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,850
to Lady Yulou too.

194
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,340
Understood.

195
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,700
Does it still hurt?

196
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,250
My Lord. Mr. Wei.

197
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,130
Why are you here?

198
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,460
Aren't you supposed
to be preparing for the feast?

199
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,460
Well,

200
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,490
Yan was worried about Qiao Ci,

201
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,850
so I brought him to check on him.

202
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,940
Yes, I'm concerned about Ci.

203
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,300
And I'm the only one who is.

204
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,100
It's just a cut.

205
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,300
Not serious.

206
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,890
You bled so much
and still say it's not serious?

207
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,220
Today's match was exhilarating.

208
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,770
That spear was perfect.

209
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,890
I could've gone

210
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,730
a few more rounds.

211
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,140
You need to be more steady.

212
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,260
Still, Qiao Ci's martial skills
are excellent.

213
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,490
Not many in Wei

214
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,420
can handle a spear like him.

215
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,850
Zhonglin, do you think

216
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,940
I should learn from Ci?

217
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,180
I think that would be wise.

218
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,020
Really?

219
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,730
However,

220
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,650
now that you've won

221
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,900
the Combat Champion,

222
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,460
you don't need to overexert yourself

223
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,370
at the hunt,

224
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,180
lest your sister worry.

225
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,820
Also, at the feast in a few days,

226
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,770
you'll represent Yanzhou.

227
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,700
Mind your words and actions.

228
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,770
Understood?

229
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,980
Yes, My Lord.

230
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,340
My Lord, Mr. Wei,

231
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll take care of him.

232
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,220
Don't worry.

233
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,690
Sure.

234
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,330
Rest well.

235
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,610
At the drill ground today,

236
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,610
the Lord even spoke up for me.

237
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,060
Looks like he cares about me.

238
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,130
The Lord has a cold face

239
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,890
but a warm heart.

240
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,980
Your heart is full of him.

241
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,370
I just said something nice about him,

242
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,980
and you're beaming.

243
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,890
I'm not defending him,

244
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,130
but the spear you used today

245
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
belonged to his brother.

246
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,180
Wei Yan?

247
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,730
His late brother,

248
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,580
Wei Bao.

249
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,420
Really?

250
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,980
They say this spear

251
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
is an extraordinary and rare weapon.

252
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,100
I don't know how good
the craftsmanship is,

253
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,700
but the fact

254
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,650
that the Lord

255
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,220
was willing to lend you

256
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,460
his late brother's weapon

257
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,420
shows how much he values you.

258
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,370
You've won the Combat Champion today.

259
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,940
Don't get pompous.

260
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,250
Stay diligent every day.

261
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,610
Also,

262
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,730
don't forget what I told you

263
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,730
about the feast.

264
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,580
It seems there's no doubt
about the Hunt Champion winner now.

265
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,100
With so much talent,

266
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,010
Liangya has really risen lately.

267
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,770
Today's selection of the Combat Champion

268
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,490
and Hunt Champion

269
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,650
is truly satisfying.

270
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,700
Why not take this chance

271
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,980
to pick

272
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,010
a Top Belle as well?

273
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,220
Speaking of the top flower,

274
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,610
none surpass the peony.

275
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,300
Chen Pang was quite lucky.

276
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,370
No wonder he built the Yulou Pavilion.

277
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,010
With a belle by his side

278
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,380
and beautiful singing every night,

279
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,370
how fortunate he was.

280
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,530
Indeed.

281
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,940
Lady Yulou is beautiful;

282
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,580
the Lady of Wei is stunning.

283
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,730
If we're choosing beauties,

284
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,700
let's not be biased.

285
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,530
The Lord of Wei is here.

286
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,460
My Lord. My Lady.

287
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,970
Everyone, please take a seat.

288
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,730
Thank you, My Lord.

289
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,060
You should do this.

290
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,340
Governors,

291
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,300
today, the Lord of Wei

292
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,890
not only invites you to a feast

293
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,850
but also has prepared gifts for all.

294
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,770
Everyone,

295
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,850
please come here.

296
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,250
Let's go and have a look.

297
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,040
This...

298
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,900
(Rongjun)

299
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,100
Is this

300
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,330
the map of the world?

301
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,330
Well...

302
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,490
Look here.

303
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,730
This is the canal

304
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,180
newly built in Wei.

305
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,490
(Panyi)
From Panyi to Rongjun,

306
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,980
it channels water along the route.

307
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,180
(Rongjun)
It brings water to the dry lands

308
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,330
and opens up trade routes
among three cities,

309
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,460
so more goods are able to circulate.

310
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,900
It's a triple-win solution.

311
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,860
What a major achievement.

312
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,290
It's truly great.

313
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,330
So, the Lord of Wei is just

314
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,330
holding this feast to show off?

315
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,330
Not quite.

316
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,420
It's about discussing how to share

317
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,620
the water source

318
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,140
with all of you.

319
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,660
What do you mean?

320
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,900
Wei has benefited

321
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,570
from the canal,

322
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,150
but I don't wish to keep them to myself.

323
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,220
That's why I host the Deer Hunt

324
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,220
and serve food and wine

325
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,730
to let everyone know:

326
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,330
Only with favorable weather

327
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,010
can we have peace and prosperity.

328
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,050
So, you mean

329
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,900
we should also build canals?

330
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
Indeed.

331
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,140
I hope to extend the Yongning Canal
in all directions,

332
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,940
connecting every river

333
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,330
across the Central Plains.

334
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,220
In this way,

335
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,860
we can solve the drought problem

336
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,450
and ease the suffering of our people.

337
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,660
Most of the wars in the Central Plains

338
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,570
have been over water.

339
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,490
The people suffer terribly.

340
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,660
When I went to Panyi

341
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,090
to inspect the Yongning Canal,

342
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,050
I saw the refugees with my own eyes

343
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
in rags,

344
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,660
living in the open.

345
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,330
If we in power

346
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,810
only chase pleasure and power

347
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,940
instead of trying

348
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,460
to ease people's pain,

349
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,010
we'll surely

350
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,980
face the consequences one day.

351
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,660
You're right.

352
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,220
The people in Yenzhou have been

353
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,980
suffering from drought for years.

354
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,420
I've long wanted

355
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,290
to learn from Wei.

356
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,050
I'm on board if you can keep your word

357
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,860
and divert water to Yaozhou.

358
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,290
It does sound

359
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,620
feasible.

360
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,460
Indeed.

361
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,290
Lord of Liangya,

362
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,010
what do you think?

363
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,460
I do not agree.

364
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,370
Why not?

365
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,700
You only want to use the canal

366
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,420
to control our armies.

367
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,980
Why should I accept that?

368
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
To show good faith,

369
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,010
I will dispatch troops

370
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,050
to help with canal construction.

371
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,830
Since you're sending troops
for the canal,

372
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,420
may I ask what your real purpose is,

373
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
the troops or the canal?

374
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,090
That's right.

375
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,900
Once the canal is complete,

376
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,380
troops from other states

377
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,700
will be able to reach

378
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,490
our heartlands by water.

379
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,380
How will we

380
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,730
defend ourselves then?

381
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,330
- Right?
- Yeah.

382
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,180
He's got a point.

383
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,460
There's something more to discuss.

384
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,010
Yes, yes.

385
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,620
You're overthinking it.

386
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,420
The benefit of the canal

387
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,490
is not only easier travel

388
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,700
but better livelihoods and peace.

389
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,330
Ten years ago,
Yanzhou relied solely on the weather.

390
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,570
Harvests depended

391
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,730
on luck.

392
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,570
When my grandfather
wanted to build the canal,

393
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,490
the people were against it.

394
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,290
He went around persuading them

395
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,490
and even dug the canal himself.

396
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,900
Only after the first canal was built

397
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,860
did the people begin to understand.

398
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,290
Thanks to the newly rebuilt
Yongning Canal by the Lord of Wei,

399
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,140
trade between Yanzhou and Wei

400
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,330
has been flourishing.

401
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,250
Yanzhou is now much more prosperous.

402
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,730
That's the true value of the canal.

403
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,810
Tell me, My Lady,

404
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,380
are you speaking

405
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,700
for Wei or Yanzhou?

406
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,330
I am both a Wei

407
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,460
and a Qiao.

408
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,360
My Lady, since you're married,

409
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,140
of course,
you're speaking for the Wei Clan.

410
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,250
Don't you agree?

411
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,420
Yes.

412
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
Certainly.

413
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,380
Then may I speak for Yanzhou?

414
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,810
- You?
- He...

415
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,490
Young Master Ci may be young,

416
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,490
but he's the future Governor of Yanzhou.

417
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,420
He can represent Yanzhou.

418
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,780
Yenzhou lacks water.

419
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,900
For the past three years,
things have been worse.

420
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,460
The rivers have dried up.

421
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,490
Crops have withered.

422
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,570
As far as I know,

423
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,700
tens of thousands

424
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
are displaced by hunger every year.

425
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,490
Why won't Yenzhou build canals?

426
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,490
Taozhou is low-lying

427
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,460
and plagued by floods.

428
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,660
It's known as the State of Floods.

429
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,420
During disasters,

430
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,530
the people beg for food elsewhere

431
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,620
only to return when the floods pass.

432
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,940
Even so, they won't abandon their homes.

433
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,780
Sir,

434
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,620
how can you turn a blind eye to this?

435
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,660
The people in Zhongzhou
are hardworking.

436
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,570
They produce silk and fruit
in abundance.

437
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,730
But rough terrain

438
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,050
blocks trade routes.

439
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,420
Goods must be carried over mountains

440
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,050
through human labor.

441
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,050
Many lives are lost each year

442
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,420
because of this.

443
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,140
In such a circumstance,

444
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,810
why do you refuse to build the canals?

445
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,140
You...

446
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,250
Fourteen years ago,

447
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,290
the Qiaos and Weis

448
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,730
became bitter enemies.

449
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,180
The Lord of Wei once swore

450
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,460
to wipe out the Qiao Clan.

451
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,770
Yet he married my sister.

452
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,940
Why?

453
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,010
Because he knows

454
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,530
his people have suffered

455
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,010
from water disasters for too long.

456
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,140
To build the canal,

457
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,730
he's willing to set aside hatred.

458
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,420
With such vision and magnanimity,

459
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,250
what are you afraid of?

460
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,780
Right.

461
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,330
Well said, Young Master Ci.

462
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,460
Yenzhou agrees

463
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,620
to build the canal.

464
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,570
We have plenty of people in Zhongzhou.

465
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,860
Maybe we can contribute labor.

466
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,050
Yaozhou can provide funding.

467
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,620
Taozhou

468
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,860
agrees as well.

469
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,460
The Lord of Wei went to great lengths
to host this event

470
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,220
and even sent a brother-in-law
to persuade us.

471
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,570
He just wants to bring the states

472
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,490
under his rule.

473
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,980
It's fine if the rest of you yield,

474
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,250
but I won't.

475
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,940
Today, I'll swear

476
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,810
that as long as I hold power,

477
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,490
I'll never become one's subordinate.

478
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,330
The Lord of Wei isn't doing this

479
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,220
for his own gain.

480
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,090
I'll write to Xue Tai

481
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,250
and persuade him

482
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,420
to help.

483
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,490
Thank you all

484
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,860
for your trust in me.

485
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
To show my sincerity

486
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,700
and speed up the canal project,

487
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,250
I will dispatch 100,000 elite soldiers

488
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,530
and over a dozen waterworks supervisors

489
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,280
to assist with your canal construction.

490
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,860
You're truly magnanimous.

491
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,440
We are willing to help Wei

492
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,090
in this endeavor.

493
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,610
Thank you, everyone.

494
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,730
- You're too kind.
- Don't mention it.

495
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,940
Goodbye.

496
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,980
Ci.

497
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
My Lord.

498
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,900
Thank you for today.

499
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,570
I was too harsh on you before.

500
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,870
Please don't take it to heart.

501
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,530
But you treat my sister well.

502
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,220
I also had some prejudice
against you before.

503
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,340
Later, I realized
it was a misunderstanding.

504
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,860
You nearly fell off a cliff

505
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,900
to save my sister in Rongjun.

506
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,770
That's what I should do for her.

507
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,220
You even fought off hundreds

508
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,460
of refugees alone to rescue her.

509
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,900
It wasn't that dramatic.

510
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,080
You refused to take concubines

511
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,010
for her

512
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,940
and even quarreled with your own kin.

513
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,380
You sent away all your mistresses

514
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,460
just to make her happy.

515
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,460
Did she tell you all that?

516
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,490
In this world,

517
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,980
besides me and Father,

518
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,490
no one else would go that far.

519
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,940
She's really gone all out

520
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,900
praising me.

521
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,370
However,

522
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,620
seeing you stand on your own today,

523
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,490
I believe

524
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,770
she's very proud.

525
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,660
Actually,

526
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,810
I was afraid she'd scold me.

527
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,360
She spent hours yesterday

528
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,940
telling me about each state's situation

529
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,530
for the speech today.

530
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,490
I was worried I'd misidentify someone
and make a scene.

531
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,010
Luckily, I bluffed my way through.

532
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,140
She told you what to say?

533
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,460
I should have guessed.

534
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,810
Still, you did great.

535
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,980
(Government Office)

536
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,290
What brings you here?

537
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,980
Is there no more work at the office?

538
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,620
It's all handled.

539
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,530
Ci told me everything.

540
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,340
I just want to ask you:

541
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,290
How did you come up with all that

542
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,330
to compliment me?

543
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,180
Ci's still a kid.

544
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,250
He misunderstood you before.

545
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,620
I just wanted to comfort him.

546
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,380
Please don't blame me

547
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,140
for making things up.

548
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,530
How could I?

549
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:39,900
You've had a hard time.

550
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,290
I promised to help you build the canal.

551
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,620
It's what I should do.

552
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,380
So,

553
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,570
you only did all that

554
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,010
because you promised me?

555
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,940
No other reason?

556
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,180
I have to fulfill

557
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,700
my promise to you.

558
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,180
You once told me this.

559
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,810
You said

560
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,810
that not every Qiao

561
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,090
is scheming

562
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,140
or calculating.

563
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,250
I didn't believe you then.

564
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,290
But now I do.

565
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,380
I was narrow-minded before.

566
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,900
Please don't blame me.

567
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,810
When we were just married,

568
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,050
we both had hidden motives.

569
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,660
I don't know when it started,

570
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,810
but I no longer want
to hide things from you

571
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,900
or lie to you.

572
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,420
I want sincerity between us.

573
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,530
Because

574
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,660
of one Letter of Marriage,

575
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,330
we went from strangers to family.

576
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,250
Now, I have a question:

577
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Do you want to become my true wife?

578
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,260
(Government Office)

579
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,420
After so much we've gone through,

580
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,980
am I not your true wife to you?

581
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,460
(The Lord of Liangya
will hold a banquet.)

582
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,900
(Please grace us with your presence.)

583
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,060
Ehuang.

584
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,600
I found out something.

585
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,570
Liu Yan killed his father

586
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,460
and brother to become
the Lord of Liangya.

587
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,620
Good for him.

588
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,900
Ehuang,

589
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,460
if you plan to remarry,

590
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,870
shouldn't you pick someone
with a better chance of winning?

591
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,530
Judging by today's feast,

592
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,050
I think the Lord of Wei

593
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,220
seems quite respected.

594
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,160
He might be the one
to unify the Central Plains.

595
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,010
But he already has a wife,

596
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,380
and he's hard to control.

597
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,660
Now that the Deer Hunt is over,

598
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,620
all the powers will start to leave.

599
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,180
I have no reason to stay.

600
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,900
You mean

601
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,570
you're going after the Lord of Liangya?

602
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,380
Spread the truth

603
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,420
about Liu Yan.

604
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,610
This...

605
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,090
Well...

606
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,250
One's mind is the hardest

607
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,250
and easiest to control.

608
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,810
As long as you understand

609
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,570
what a person truly wants

610
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,700
and what they're thinking,

611
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,420
you can control them

612
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,730
like controlling

613
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,050
a puppet.

614
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,220
Have the invitations all been sent?

615
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,010
Why hasn't anyone shown up?

616
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,250
Everything was fine before.

617
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,250
However,

618
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,220
everyone suddenly knows
about what you did

619
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,490
in Liangya overnight.

620
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
I told you.

621
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,180
You were the rightful heir.

622
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,900
- Why...
- It's just an excuse.

623
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,050
They're avoiding my invitation

624
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,330
because I've fallen out with Wei Shao.

625
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,490
They're all afraid to take a side.

626
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,570
My Lord,

627
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,460
Yenzhou sent word

628
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,570
that the governor got drunk

629
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,720
and can't attend the banquet.

630
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,060
- Leave.
- Yes.

631
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,860
My Lord, the Governor of Yaozhou
suddenly fell ill.

632
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,460
The Governor of Zhongzhou was occupied.

633
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,560
Neither of them can make it.

634
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,700
Is Lady Yulou not coming either?

635
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,380
Please don't misunderstand my cousin.

636
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,660
She couldn't bear to see you drink alone

637
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,380
and came to attend.

638
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,940
I heard you

639
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,460
were raised by others

640
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,530
and grew up in Yanzhou.

641
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
So what?

642
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,900
I am similar to you.

643
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
I grew up

644
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,490
in Yujun.

645
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,490
People like us,

646
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,620
unloved by our families,

647
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,530
are given away like pawns

648
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,420
from a young age.

649
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,380
We are never favored by fate.

650
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,940
I came today

651
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,730
to comfort you.

652
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,730
You did no wrong

653
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,520
by killing your father and brother.

654
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,090
They used you and discarded you

655
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,180
when you were no longer useful.

656
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,860
You tried to please them but failed.

657
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,770
You lived in constant fear

658
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,530
of being replaced.

659
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,290
The pain you feel

660
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,250
is something few can understand.

661
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,620
Yet you can?

662
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,860
I was born in Wushan.

663
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,010
I'm from the declining Su Clan.

664
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,250
Since childhood,

665
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,860
they said my forehead birthmark

666
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,490
looked like a peony,

667
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,420
symbolizing the rare empress's fate.

668
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,290
All these years,

669
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,900
I have taken it upon myself

670
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,940
to help revive the Su Clan,

671
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,980
carefully managing
my marriage prospects.

672
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,490
Until one year,

673
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,570
I suddenly discovered

674
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,570
they had another girl

675
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,860
with seven moles on her palm.

676
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,090
They said that was

677
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,380
a once-in-a-thousand-year fate.

678
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,090
At that moment, I realized

679
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,530
I was just a pawn to them,

680
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,220
which was replaceable

681
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,010
when no longer useful.

682
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,810
What became of that girl?

683
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,090
She was disfigured.

684
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,220
You did not come only

685
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,770
to confide in me, right?

686
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,900
I have wandered all my life

687
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,660
and used to people

688
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,810
coveting my beauty

689
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,090
and fate.

690
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,330
Right now,

691
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,970
I just want to find
a like-minded partner

692
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,960
to discuss the great cause with.

693
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,420
Have you been to Liangya?

694
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,250
Not yet.

695
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,110
Liangya is beautiful this time of year.

696
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,050
After the Deer Hunt,

697
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,730
I can take you there

698
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,380
to enjoy the scenery.

699
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,570
Thank you, My Lord.

700
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,670
Liangya is not the only place

701
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,520
with beautiful scenery in the world.

702
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
It's late now.

703
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,050
I will take my leave.

704
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,100
I have no intention
of relying on Liangya.

705
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
I only wish

706
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,140
to form a good bond with you.

707
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,810
In the future,

708
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,330
if I need help,

709
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,220
I hope you will assist.

710
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,780
My Lord,

711
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,490
Lady Yulou

712
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,570
just wants to plant that flower
on her head

713
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,300
in good soil.

714
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,460
Don't be fooled by her.

715
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,690
I know well

716
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,780
she is just pretending.

717
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,260
Then why are you

718
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,490
so melancholic?

719
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,340
She reminds me of someone.

720
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,210
Lady Qiao.

721
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,780
These days,

722
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,380
you've been reunited with old friends.

723
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,690
That'd certainly remind you of the past.

724
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,300
Just now,

725
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,780
I suddenly understood

726
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,530
why she abandoned me

727
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,170
in Panyi that day.

728
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,090
Lady Qiao was born

729
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,570
in the Qiao Clan,

730
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,260
raised in luxury,

731
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
and loved by her grandfather and uncle.

732
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,610
Lady Ding treats her
like her own daughter.

733
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,420
Besides,

734
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,820
she has siblings
like Daqiao and Qiao Ci.

735
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,460
If I were her,

736
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,170
I'd sacrifice

737
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,050
for a family like that too.

738
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,380
I'd also swear

739
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,260
to protect all the people.

740
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,300
However, I had

741
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
no maternal family protection

742
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,340
and was bullied by a wicked woman.

743
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,820
As Lady Yulou said,

744
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,210
people like us

745
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,420
only deserve to live like tools.

746
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,340
We're always living in fear.

747
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,210
One misstep

748
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,340
can lead to being scorned

749
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,210
and rejected.

750
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,260
Lady Qiao is high above.

751
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,130
We're fated on separate paths.

752
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,820
It's not that I see others as ants

753
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,490
but that I was born

754
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,340
like an ant.

755
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,570
Lady Yulou is the same.

756
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,060
(Virtuous Words)

757
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,170
The Lord of Liangya
asked me to send this.

758
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,010
Did he say anything?

759
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,390
The Lord said

760
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,280
he'd depart from Yujun tomorrow.

761
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,650
With this pearl as a token,

762
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:21,690
he'd like to invite you

763
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,900
to visit Liangya in the future.

764
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,690
Thanks to the Lord of Liangya.

765
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,650
I'll take my leave.

766
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,210
Put it away.

767
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,420
Yes.

768
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,340
You must be careful on the way.

769
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,460
If only I hadn't let Yulu
return to Kangjun first.

770
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,010
Then he'd be there to look after you.

771
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,440
I came alone,

772
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,530
and I will

773
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,820
leave alone.

774
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,660
Enough.

775
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
Without me by your side,

776
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,460
you must work hard every day.

777
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,820
Tell Father that I'm fine.

778
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,860
Tell him not to worry.

779
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,880
Also,

780
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,010
when you pass by Boya on your way back,

781
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,650
make sure to send
some supplies to Cousin.

782
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,210
It's no better than Yujun or Kangjun.

783
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,380
Cousin's life must be hard.

784
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,300
Noted.

785
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,620
My Lord,

786
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm entrusting my sister to you.

787
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,570
If I ever find out

788
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,780
you don't treat her well,

789
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,340
I will seek justice

790
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,460
for her myself.

791
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,330
Mr. Wei.

792
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,140
Let's drink together another day.

793
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,570
Drinking is fine,

794
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,820
but you can't go to places

795
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,040
like Luozhong Tavern anymore.

796
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,140
Understood?

797
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,900
Do you want to know

798
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,610
whose horse is faster,

799
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,740
Qiao Ci's or mine?

800
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,140
Let's go.

801
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,820
Hyah!

802
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,530
My Lord,

803
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,690
Lady Yulou wants to see you.

804
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,970
Is she leaving?

805
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,160
Lady Yulou said

806
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,260
she couldn't leave for now

807
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,490
and begged for your protection.

808
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
This is my fault.

809
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,820
I forgot that a jade
is a crime in itself.

810
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,860
At the Deer Hunt,

811
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,980
I revealed what I have.

812
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,690
Both the Lord of Liangya
and the Governor of Taozhou

813
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,570
want to force me into marriage now.

814
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,170
For now,

815
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,080
I don't even dare return to my family.

816
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,380
That worthless family of mine

817
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,740
would surely push me out.

818
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,010
Back then,

819
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,260
I was forced to marry Chen Xiang.

820
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,130
It was the same situation.

821
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,650
I was too young then

822
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,610
to decide for myself.

823
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,780
But now,

824
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,780
I no longer wish

825
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,760
to be a puppet used for gain.

826
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,260
For the sake of Bogong,

827
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,780
Zhonglin,

828
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,940
may I stay in Yujun for a while

829
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,650
to hide away?
