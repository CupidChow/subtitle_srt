30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,970
Out of fear that the truth
would come out,

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,460
Liu Yan ordered a siege.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,290
We couldn't hold them off.

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,260
General Wei Liang fought to
get me out of there,

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,900
but he...

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,660
He...

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,380
I...

37
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,320
It should've been me.

38
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,130
Qiao Ci,

39
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,500
look at me.

40
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,690
Wei Liang went to fetch you, right?

41
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,380
Where is he now?

42
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,130
Look at me.

43
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,980
Where is Wei Liang?

44
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,170
He went to Yujun.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,260
Answer me. Where is he now?

46
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,780
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,570
Where is Wei Liang?

48
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,660
Where is he?

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,940
It should've been you.

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,240
Why did it have to be him?

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,380
Why not a Qiao?

52
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,220
Wei Xiao!

53
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,290
My Lord!

54
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,180
Reporting!

55
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,660
Liu Yan has taken Panyi with his troops.

56
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,060
Pass down my orders:

57
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,380
All troops, stay on alert.

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,260
Tomorrow,

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,170
we march on Panyi!

60
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,530
Yes.

61
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,690
My Lord.

62
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
My Lord, My Lord.

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,450
Let me lead a team to bring him back.

64
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,130
I asked Wei Liang to go. He'll be fine.

65
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,060
He just didn't see him.

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,260
- Wei Qu.
- I'll get him back.

67
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,290
Wei Qu, calm down!

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,130
Wei Qu!

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,170
Let me bring him back!

70
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,250
Get up.

71
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,530
Get up.

72
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,220
My Lord, let me bring him back.

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,060
Get up.

74
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,410
Wei Liang will be okay.

75
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,170
I'll go now. I'll bring him back!

76
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,170
Wei Qu, hear my command.

77
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,660
Tomorrow, take a cavalry unit

78
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,530
to Kangjun.

79
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,850
Find Qiao Ping.

80
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,780
Bring

81
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,660
Wei Liang back.

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,850
I will bring him back.

83
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,380
Yes, My Lord.

84
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,420
- My Lady.
- Manman. Manman.

85
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,260
- My Lady.
- Manman.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,940
- Manman.
- My Lady.

87
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,850
Lie down.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,060
My Lord.

89
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,610
Don't blame yourself.

90
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,660
I just hate

91
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,660
that I can't take this pain for you.

92
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,340
You grew up with Wei Liang.

93
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,850
You weren't real brothers,

94
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,810
but he was like a real brother to you.

95
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,370
Now, he was killed because of my family.

96
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,370
Even if we paid with our lives,

97
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,900
it wouldn't ease your pain.

98
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,020
I once promised you
that I'd give you more kids

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,930
and restore the past glory.

100
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,900
But now I've made you lose Wei Liang.

101
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,220
And Xiaotao...

102
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,730
She's still...

103
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,610
She's still waiting for Wei Liang.

104
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,410
This isn't your fault.

105
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,220
You've tried to balance both clans.

106
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410
It's been exhausting.

107
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,610
Besides,

108
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,170
Qiao Yue and Liu Yan

109
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,250
did this.

110
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,850
You had nothing to do with it.

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,460
I will never blame you

112
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,250
for this.

113
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,660
But from now on,

114
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,100
I may...

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,980
I understand.

116
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,730
Whether it's to avenge Wei Liang,

117
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,460
take back Panyi for the people,

118
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,340
seek justice for General Wei Liang,

119
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,730
or punish my uncle's betrayal,

120
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,250
you must go to war at once.

121
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,100
Don't worry.

122
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,580
I don't blame you.

123
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,410
Thank you, Manman.

124
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,490
You've never failed me,

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,810
and I will never fail you.

126
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,020
I promise.

127
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,340
This matter

128
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,410
will not implicate others.

129
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
I give you my word.

130
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
After I leave,

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,290
take care of this family for me.

132
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,020
Take care of yourself

133
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,540
and Feifei.

134
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,410
I may not be back

135
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,170
in time for Feifei's birth.

136
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,930
That's okay.

137
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,220
This time,

138
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,340
I won't see you off.

139
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,460
Be careful on your journey.

140
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,130
Don't worry.

141
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,620
(Yujun)

142
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,420
My Lord, don't worry.

143
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,480
Wei Xiao and I will protect Yujun.

144
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,530
We'll patrol day and night.

145
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,730
Nothing will happen.

146
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,460
Lady Xu and Lady Zhu
will take care of the Lady.

147
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,730
You have nothing to worry about.

148
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,140
Good.

149
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,100
- Depart!
- Yes!

150
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
Hyah!

151
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,850
My Lady, take care of yourself.

152
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,400
Don't strain yourself or harm the baby.

153
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,300
How's Xiaotao?

154
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,010
Xiaotao...

155
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,100
You're really going to Yanzhou?

156
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,820
I'll go and pick a real Yanzhou orchid

157
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,490
to marry you.

158
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,770
Are you asking me to serve you?

159
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,610
No need for that.

160
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,100
Just marry me.

161
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,730
Once I've saved enough wages,

162
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,660
I'll have the Lord ask

163
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,260
for your mother's approval on my behalf.

164
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,820
He values you.

165
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,130
He's afraid he's not worthy of you,

166
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,730
so he wants to do more.

167
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,490
Only then will he feel at ease.

168
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,820
You...

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,980
Come back safe, okay?

170
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,490
I've got your safety charm.

171
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,400
Even if I get injured,

172
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,460
I'll come back and ask
for your mother's approval.

173
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,420
Pah, pah, pah.

174
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,850
You won't get injured.

175
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,820
Mine is a little gold dart.

176
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,730
Every time we head to battle,

177
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,730
we leave these little weapons behind.

178
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,980
I want to give this to you.

179
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Seeing it

180
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,300
will be like seeing me.

181
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,020
Before General Wei Liang died,

182
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,100
he asked me

183
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,010
to bring this orchid to you.

184
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,940
He must not have wanted you
to grieve like this.

185
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,210
He said

186
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,770
he'd bring the orchid

187
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,980
and propose to me.

188
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,530
Tell Xiaotao

189
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,700
not to wait for me!

190
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,490
This is from him.

191
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,700
My mother said

192
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,610
he was afraid I'd suffer

193
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,180
and I'd look down on him one day

194
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,530
so he made the betrothal gifts
so complex.

195
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,420
She asked me to let him.

196
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,650
She said it was more festive.

197
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,220
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

198
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,850
Lord Yang.

199
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,370
What's the situation in the city?

200
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,860
The defenses are weak.

201
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,100
We can't hold against Liangya.

202
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,300
Panyi has completely fallen

203
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,420
into Liu Yan's hands.

204
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,400
Lord Yang,

205
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,370
we once helped Lord Qiao
knock at the gate.

206
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,010
So now...

207
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,880
Should we have

208
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,460
to turn to Liangya now?

209
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,700
Listen.

210
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,140
(Zhongzhou has defected)

211
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,490
Lady Yulou has swayed Zhongzhou,

212
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,530
dealing a major blow to Wei.

213
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,980
Now, Wei Shao's allies
are turning to me.

214
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I wonder how he defies me now.

215
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,730
But the Wei cavalry is still strong.

216
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,730
Even without allies,
they're hard to defeat.

217
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,470
Last time at Panyi,

218
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,700
Liangya lost to them.

219
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,850
Things are different now.

220
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,770
Wei Shao must pass this way

221
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,370
(Yongning City)
to reach us.

222
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,530
Yongning City?

223
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,650
He once built a dam here

224
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,940
to divert floods.

225
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,480
If the upper course breaks
and the lower course is blocked,

226
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,060
what do you think will happen

227
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
when he passes through?

228
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,730
Brilliant.

229
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,490
If it works,

230
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,220
this place will become Wei Shao's grave.

231
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,010
That day,

232
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,490
Lady Qiao scared off my reinforcements.

233
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,100
Today, I shall return that disgrace

234
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,010
in full.

235
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,210
Who's there?

236
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,850
Come in.

237
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,250
I'm here to deliver a report.

238
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,220
The Wei army is on the move.

239
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,610
My Lords,

240
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,100
(Zhongzhou has defected)
what to do?

241
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,220
Just as expected.

242
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,490
Lord Yang, guard the Panyi dam.

243
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,130
Be ready to release the water.

244
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,100
Yes. I'll prepare to open the gate.

245
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,180
Not to open it.

246
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,100
Destroy it.

247
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,010
Destroy the dam?

248
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,890
That can't be.

249
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,420
I've observed the clouds.

250
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,890
Heavy rains are coming.

251
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,650
If we break the dam now,

252
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,770
the flood downstream
will be catastrophic.

253
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,060
If the rain intensifies,

254
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,180
the people will be doomed.

255
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,730
The Lord of Wei...

256
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,770
Wei Shao deserves it,
but the people along the way

257
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,530
are innocent.

258
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,730
To achieve greatness,
one can't fuss over trifles.

259
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,420
Lord Yang, my late father trusted you.

260
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,650
Surely you understand that.

261
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,850
You call this a trifle?

262
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,210
Fine.

263
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
I understand.

264
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,100
Governor, My Lord,

265
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,180
I'll do as you command.

266
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,180
But the dam of the Yongning Canal

267
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,460
is made of giant stones.

268
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,820
It's hard to destroy.

269
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,180
If we use sulfur as an explosive,

270
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,300
it must be placed

271
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,100
beneath the load-bearing wooden beams.

272
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,250
Without the right method,

273
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,700
it won't work.

274
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,610
My Lord,

275
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,380
he makes a point.

276
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,770
Then please wait here.

277
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,980
I'll fetch the engineering diagram.

278
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,140
With that, it'll be more effective.

279
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,490
Very well.

280
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,730
Be quick.

281
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:28,930
Yes.

282
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,330
The Yongning Canal project
is very complex,

283
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,810
especially the section
from Panyi to Xindu.

284
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,770
It took years to build.

285
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,810
Now,

286
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,810
it links two major rivers.

287
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,730
I can't even tell if we're standing

288
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,980
above the Yang River

289
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,490
or the Pei River.

290
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,050
Lord Yang,
you took Wei's salary for years.

291
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,160
Do you see yourself as from Yanzhou

292
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,570
or Wei?

293
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,090
Does it matter?

294
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,490
Lord Qiao devoted years to this dam

295
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,700
to unify the land.

296
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,460
He hoped

297
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,500
for good traffic and trade

298
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,140
so the people no longer needed
to travel long

299
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
for water, food, and minerals.

300
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,140
I've seen

301
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,730
that same ambition

302
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,940
not only in Lord Qiao

303
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,110
but in the Lord of Wei, too.

304
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,420
They say you built canals in Panyi

305
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,290
and even in Rongjun.

306
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,940
Panyi wasn't always

307
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,700
a water town.

308
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,570
It used to be a flood zone.

309
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,140
Thanks to Lord Qiao's water management,
it became what it is today.

310
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,420
I just followed him around,

311
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,490
digging trenches.

312
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,810
That's how I gained a little experience

313
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,180
to fight back against the floods
of the Yang River.

314
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,860
That must've been hard.

315
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,050
When this is over,

316
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,220
you'll be rewarded.

317
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,330
I'm just

318
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,730
following orders.

319
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,250
There's no hardship in that.

320
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,010
But today,

321
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,660
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

322
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,620
Father built the canal for Yanzhou.

323
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,490
Destroying it now

324
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,420
is to eliminate a threat to Yanzhou.

325
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,290
You won't fail him.

326
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,420
Hurry and unroll the diagram.

327
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,620
Let's get started.

328
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,060
Sure.

329
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,380
An assassin!

330
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,570
Someone help!

331
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,250
Don't move!

332
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,570
What are you doing?

333
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,770
I couldn't kill Liu Yan,

334
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,570
but I can kill you!

335
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,420
However,

336
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,900
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

337
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,730
Yang Feng, are you insane?

338
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,770
How can you live after killing me?

339
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,530
Without the dam

340
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,900
and Panyi,

341
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,730
what's the point

342
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,380
of surviving alone?

343
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,090
Let him go.

344
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll spare your life.

345
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,490
If Zhen Zhi could die for the cause,

346
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,490
so can I.

347
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,840
My Lord,

348
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,980
don't push him.

349
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,610
Fine.

350
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,770
I'm sorry, Lord Qiao.

351
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

352
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,700
You...

353
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,090
My Lord...

354
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,330
Even a minor mayor dared defy me?

355
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,220
Wei Shao,

356
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,570
I'll kill you myself.

357
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,500
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

358
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,980
Don't worry too much

359
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,900
about Qiao and Liu.

360
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
It had nothing to do

361
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,140
with you or Ci.

362
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,620
Zhonglin will handle it.

363
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,660
Has your appetite

364
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,140
become better?

365
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,490
Yes.

366
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,810
My Lady.

367
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,090
My Lady.

368
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,700
My Lady.

369
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,050
General Wei Xiao requests an audience.

370
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,140
Let him in.

371
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,980
Yes.

372
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,050
My Ladies,

373
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,090
news from the border.

374
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,960
Su Ehuang and Xue Tai

375
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,180
are leading the Zhongzhou army

376
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,020
to attack Yujun.

377
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,770
Zhongzhou has defected too?

378
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,330
How many troops are in Yujun now?

379
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
My Lady,

380
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,570
our troops

381
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,490
are fewer than 60,000.

382
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,290
Besides the border garrisons,

383
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,010
the Lord also left 5,000 each

384
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,220
in Yunzhong and Rongjun.

385
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,980
Grandmother,

386
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,980
I believe we should dispatch couriers

387
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,600
to warn the Lord,

388
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,900
so he'll be more careful.

389
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,210
They can also alert the border generals

390
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,530
to support one another

391
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,290
in case they're attacked.

392
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,400
Approved.

393
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,730
Let's do as you suggest.

394
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,810
Though the enemy comes strong,

395
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,430
the men of the Wei Clan

396
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,650
are battle-tested.

397
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,290
Heaven favors Wei.

398
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,700
We will overcome this.

399
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,730
General, please wait.

401
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,820
Grandmother,

402
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,050
Yujun is in grave danger.

403
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,730
We should post a notice
to call on the people

404
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,490
to defend Yujun with us.

405
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,620
Anyone who volunteers

406
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,490
can get armor and weapons in the office.

407
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,900
Also, we should open the gates

408
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,290
for two days

409
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,530
to let those who wish to go

410
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,140
leave Yujun.

411
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,860
When peace returns,

412
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,010
they can come back.

413
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,370
The Wei Clan

414
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,090
always puts the people first.

415
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,130
Do as you say.

416
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,180
- General Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

417
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,420
Escort Lady Zhu and the Lady

418
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,010
out of the city.

419
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,290
- Be quick.
- Yes.

420
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,130
Grandmother,

421
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,900
I can't leave.

422
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,700
I must stay in Yujun.

423
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,490
Before the Lord left,

424
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,730
I promised him

425
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,780
that...

426
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,770
- Lady Qiao.
- She's about to give birth.

427
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,620
Summon the physician!

428
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,730
Hurry!

429
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,250
Breathe. Breathe.

430
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,130
Hurry!

431
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,770
My Lady, please wait outside.

432
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,980
My Lady.

433
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,380
My Lady, push!

434
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,330
Come on, wipe her sweat.

435
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,700
Don't panic, My Lady.

436
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,770
Just relax.

437
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,770
Inhale. Push.

438
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,330
My Lady.

439
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,770
Don't panic. Hurry.

440
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,860
Relax.

441
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,330
Whoa.

442
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,370
Watch out!

443
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,930
Watch out!

444
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,700
- Inhale.
- Inhale.

445
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,820
Exhale.

446
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,570
Not yet.

447
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,460
Push again.

448
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,300
Exhale.

449
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,460
- Push!
- Push!

450
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,250
Push!

451
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,290
Push, My Lady!

452
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,250
Push!

453
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,980
Bear with it.

454
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,730
Come on, one, two.

455
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,140
Push!

456
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,620
Hurry!

457
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,810
Lift!

458
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,840
We can see the head.

459
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,860
We can see the head.

460
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,700
Push!

461
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,220
The baby is here!

462
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,390
The baby is here!

463
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,330
The baby is here!

464
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,010
- The baby is here.
- It's born.

465
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,250
Alright.

466
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,010
Congratulations, My Lady.

467
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,250
You have a child now.

468
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,740
My Lady,

469
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,900
look.

470
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,860
It's a little girl.

471
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,620
Feifei.

472
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,290
This is wonderful.

473
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,330
Wonderful.

474
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,530
Both of you are safe.

475
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,380
Mother.

476
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,250
Thank you.

477
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,770
She looks adorable.

478
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,610
How are you?

479
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,770
It must've been so hard.

480
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,980
Not at all.

481
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,010
You're soaked in sweat.

482
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,010
Report!

483
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,460
Yunzhong, Rongjun,
and Hanjun have fallen.

484
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,330
A force of 100,000 is marching on Yujun.

485
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,570
What do we do?

486
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,470
My Lady!

487
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
- What to do?
- Pack now.

488
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,010
Let's bring the Lady back to Yanzhou.

489
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,530
- What should we do?
- What to do?

490
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,370
Where do we go?

491
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,770
- What should we do?
- What to do?

492
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,630
Where can we go?

493
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,530
Stop panicking.

494
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,420
Grandmother,

495
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,860
the Lord left 60,000 men here.

496
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,420
How many troops does he have?

497
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,980
Building the Yongning Canal

498
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,220
cost Wei dearly.

499
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,330
We don't have many left.

500
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,700
How is he

501
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,420
supposed to fight?

502
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,570
What to do?

503
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,180
Good child.

504
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,420
Since Zhonglin has arranged it,

505
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,590
he must have a plan to win.

506
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,570
Get some rest.

507
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,140
I'll arrange for guards

508
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,570
to escort you

509
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,490
and Lady Zhu out.

510
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,980
I can't leave.

511
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,980
Grandmother.

512
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,940
Before the Lord left,

513
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,940
I promised him

514
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,420
to take care of everything at home

515
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,620
with no mistakes.

516
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,010
Grandmother, you are my family.

517
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
Yujun is my home.

518
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,140
I am the Lady of Wei.

519
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,250
I will stand with the people of Yujun.

520
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,730
I won't leave either.

521
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,330
Stop making more trouble.

522
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,090
In my whole life,

523
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
I've only wanted

524
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,180
to make you happy,

525
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,900
but I'm foolish

526
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,290
and often fail.

527
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,380
If you can see me differently

528
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,730
when I choose to stay,

529
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,570
then I won't leave.

530
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,570
Yes.

531
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,860
Though I'm

532
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,730
afraid of death,

533
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,290
my sons

534
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,010
and my husband

535
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,530
would never be deserters.

536
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,980
I will never

537
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,250
shame them

538
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,860
because of me.

539
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,850
Mother,

540
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,570
please let me stay.

541
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,140
I beg you.

542
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,170
Look.

543
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,980
These are

544
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,660
the Ladies of Wei.

545
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,380
She's smiling.

546
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,180
My Lord,

547
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,380
just as expected,

548
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,810
Liu Yan took Panyi

549
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,880
and destroyed the dam.

550
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,810
The Yang River broke free,
flooding everything.

551
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,620
He wants to trap us here

552
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,810
to miss our chance.

553
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,490
Anything else?

554
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,570
The couriers report

555
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,700
that Lord Zhen and Lord Yang
died for the cause.

556
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,940
Qiao Yue is dead.

557
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,460
How many of our men are left?

558
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,700
Fewer than 70%.

559
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,740
(Yujun)

560
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,090
(Panyi)

561
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,460
We can't delay anymore.

562
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,570
We must hurry to Panyi

563
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,910
and retake the Yongning Canal.

564
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,330
Report!

565
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,700
My Lord,

566
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,340
Lady Yulou and General Xue Tai

567
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,140
are leading 100,000 troops
to besiege Yujun.

568
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,590
They'll break through the gates soon.

569
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,900
Please come back to defend.

570
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,460
My Lord,

571
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,660
Lady Xu, Lady Zhu, and the Lady

572
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,980
are still in Yujun.

573
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,490
If the enemy breaches the city,

574
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,700
their lives will be at risk.

575
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,940
Fifteen years ago in Xindu,

576
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,700
the Wei Clan lost three generations.

577
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Must we face

578
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,490
the same today?

579
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,650
My Lord,

580
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,330
shall we march on Panyi

581
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,490
or fall back to defend Yujun?

582
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,220
Grandfather wants to keep
the people of Yanzhou

583
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,860
out of this war.

584
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,730
Whether to fail one person

585
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,460
or fail the people...

586
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,460
If it were me,
I wouldn't know how to choose either.

587
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,100
(Panyi)

588
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,930
Pass on my orders:

589
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,570
Let's march on Panyi

590
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,560
and retake the Yongning Canal.

591
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,660
Yes.

592
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,770
(Government Office)
Those seeking shelter

593
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,010
with nowhere else to go,

594
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,140
regardless of age,

595
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,420
may take refuge in the hall.

596
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,900
My Lady,

597
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,570
I want to enlist.

598
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,460
The enemy

599
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,330
is at our doorstep.

600
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,290
Though I am a woman,

601
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,980
I refuse to be bullied.

602
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,660
- I want to protect my home.
- Yes.

603
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,140
I once followed the late lord

604
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,570
to fight across the land.

605
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,730
Now the enemy's children
have reached our homes.

606
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,610
Yes.

607
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,770
We must show them

608
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,250
the power of Wei.

609
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,530
- Yes.
- Drive the enemy away!

610
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,510
Defend Wei!

611
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,700
Drive the enemy away! Defend Wei!

612
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,010
I know you want to protect our home.

613
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,100
Thank you all.

614
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,980
Count us in.

615
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,420
Count us in.

616
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,180
We may fail

617
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,900
in the battle today.

618
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,620
But we stand here

619
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,220
to tell everyone

620
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,730
the Wei Clan
hasn't betrayed the Wei State

621
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,900
and never will.

622
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
Yes.

623
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,860
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

624
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,490
the Wei State stands.

625
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,060
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

626
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,220
the Wei State stands.

627
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,770
The Wei Clan

628
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,860
will stand with you.

629
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,050
Defend Yujun!

630
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,700
Protect the Wei State!

631
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:47,010
Defend Yujun! Protect the Wei State!

632
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,220
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

633
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,620
Cheers! Come on!

634
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,570
We're on duty. Drink less.

635
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,210
What's there to fear?

636
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,050
The battle is at Panyi.

637
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,300
Who'd come here?

638
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,090
Cheers!

639
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,370
Come on!

640
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,580
If you go to Kangjun,

641
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,370
you can bring back
the Lord's father-in-law

642
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,370
and pick up an orchid on the way.

643
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,130
Then you can marry Xiaotao
when you're back.

644
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,420
Come on.

645
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,010
Let me fill your bowl.

646
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,090
Your face wasn't harmed.

647
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,130
We're not staying here.

648
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,570
I'm here to get you, Liang.

649
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,610
I'm bringing you home.

650
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,380
Aren't you Wei's greatest warrior?

651
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,900
Why did you die here?

652
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,490
How could you die here?

653
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,530
Come on, come with me.

654
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,090
I won't draw
grass straws anymore, Liang.

655
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,860
I won't.

656
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,610
Get up. Come home with me.

657
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,980
Get up!

658
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,900
Get up. I can't carry you.

659
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,460
We won't draw grass straws anymore.

660
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,090
Xiaotao's waiting to marry you.

661
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,860
Liang, let's go home.

662
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,820
Let's go.

663
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,010
You must be cold.

664
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,850
Liang,

665
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,010
we're not staying here.

666
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,690
I'll bring you home.

667
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,940
(Kangjun Wharf)

668
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,380
(Wei)

669
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,620
(Wei)

670
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,460
The Wei Clan

671
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,460
still has to fight for the Qiao Clan.

672
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,090
The Lord sent me to rescue a Qiao.

673
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,900
Come with me.

674
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,050
Enemy! Reinforce the defense!

675
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,890
Yes.

676
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,010
Liang.

677
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,210
Liang.

678
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,090
I lost an arm.

679
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,170
Go to Kangjun

680
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,490
and bring

681
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,850
Wei Liang back.

682
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,010
Who's there?

683
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,940
Wei Qu, General of Wei.

684
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,170
I'm here to rescue you.

685
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,690
Thanks, General Wei.

686
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,340
Can you see anything?

687
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,210
Though I can't see,

688
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,900
I still have some basic fighting skills.

689
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,090
I won't hold you back.

690
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,170
Just give me

691
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,420
some instructions, General.

692
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,530
Hold on to me tight.

693
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,300
General,

694
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,460
who's on your back?

695
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,820
Wei Liang, General of Wei.

696
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,570
You two,

697
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,260
I suggest you surrender.

698
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,460
This is Yanzhou.

699
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,090
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

700
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,820
Soldiers, you might not know,

701
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,010
but your governor

702
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,210
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

703
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,690
Liangya is hiding this

704
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,420
to divide Yanzhou later.

705
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,900
My brother is dead?

706
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,690
Qiao Yue is dead.

707
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,420
So, the prefect is

708
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,490
the governor now.

709
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,650
Are you sure

710
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,820
you want to fight him now?

711
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
Don't listen to him.

712
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,260
Seize these two immediately.

713
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,980
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

714
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,540
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

715
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,480
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

716
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,340
let alone you.

717
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,090
- Well.
- Think carefully.

718
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,340
Will you listen to a Liangya man

719
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,300
or your prefect?
