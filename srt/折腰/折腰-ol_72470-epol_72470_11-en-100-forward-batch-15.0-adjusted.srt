=Episode 11=

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,720
Now that everything's come to light,

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,720
all you care about is Zheng Shu.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
What about His Lordship's dignity?

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,240
Everyone says you love your son,

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,570
but do you really?

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
You want Zheng Shu to be his concubine.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,050
You tampered with the box

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,640
for her sake.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,930
You even drugged His Lordship,

39
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,330
all for Zheng Shu.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
His Lordship is the ruler of Wei.

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,680
His marriage should serve the greater good.

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,640
The marriage alliance is taking effect,

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
but you keep interfering.

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,070
I'm afraid you don't want His Lordship

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,550
to truly take the throne!

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,610
How dare you!

47
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,120
You don't want Zheng Shu to leave.

48
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,680
Do you know the Lord is leaving

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,730
out of shame?

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,120
In this matter,

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,010
he did nothing wrong.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,490
He's the Lord of Wei,

53
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,640
yet he had to oversee the canal repairs.

54
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,120
Did you ever consider how far

55
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,330
he'd have to travel
and how much he'd suffer?

56
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,400
Even the shoes you casually gifted him

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,730
were a size too small.

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,400
I noticed Zheng Shu
was perfectly dressed

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,080
with your care,

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,400
so I realized you can be thoughtful,

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,730
but you just won't be thoughtful
to the Lord.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,890
Since that's the case,

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
from this day forward,

64
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,840
I alone will take care

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,450
of his daily needs.

66
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,290
Enough.

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,050
How could you understand
my care about Zhonglin?

68
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,520
You... Get out!

69
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,450
Mother, please rest well.

70
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,330
My Lady.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,940
(Yujun, Wei State)

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,700
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,650
Go find something fragrant for me.

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,290
We just returned
from the execution ground,

75
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,540
covered in the stench of blood.

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,510
Someone doesn't like that smell.

77
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,090
It's better to avoid trouble.

78
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,570
Yes.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,730
No need to rush, My Lady.

80
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,120
There's no telling
when the Lord will return.

81
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,050
It's fine.

82
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,360
Just a few more stitches.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,200
I want to finish it
before he departs tomorrow.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,490
In that case,

85
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,120
let me help you finish it.

86
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,440
No need to fuss over such a short time.

87
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,120
Since I've promised Mother
to treat him with sincerity,

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
I mustn't be negligent.

89
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,370
How about this?

90
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,800
Go prepare a meal first.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,360
If the Lord doesn't return tonight,

92
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,170
choose a few of his favorites

93
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,200
and deliver them to him.

94
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,650
Tell him to take care of himself.

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Yes, My Lady.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,440
What is this?

97
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,410
It's rose petals.

98
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,930
If you find it unsuitable,

99
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll go replace it.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,290
No need.

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,650
Roses may have thorns,

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
but they're fragrant and sweet.

103
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,610
My Lord, you're back.

104
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,850
I've had food prepared.

105
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,760
Would you like to eat with me?

106
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,290
Do as you see fit.

107
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,170
That day, I was just startled,

108
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,760
not afraid of you.

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,290
Why bring that up?

110
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,320
I didn't take it to heart.

111
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,730
I know what kind of man you are.

112
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,490
Even in the most perilous moments,

113
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,800
you never forced me.

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,420
However,

115
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,490
that day wasn't your fault.

116
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,050
Why blame yourself?

117
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
I never blamed myself.

118
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,320
Reconstructing the canal

119
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,970
is indeed important.

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,300
But you had made

121
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,120
the arrangements clear

122
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,880
back when we were in Panyi.

123
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,320
This time,

124
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,730
it's just a formality.

125
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,000
You're a noble.

126
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,140
Normally...

127
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,530
I know you're eloquent.

128
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
Now, let's eat.

129
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,120
What's this?

130
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,120
I noticed your belt was getting old,

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
so...

132
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,240
You made this yourself?

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,730
I was in a rush.

134
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,120
It's not very good.

135
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,930
That's true.

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,850
This pair of mandarin ducks

137
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,120
looks like two ducks.

138
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,970
It's not that bad.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,730
Besides, they aren't mandarin ducks.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,490
They're phoenixes.

141
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,680
You can't even tell phoenixes,

142
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,750
yet you dare criticize me?

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,200
That's why your needlework is poor.

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Who would guess these are phoenixes?

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,290
When you're bored at home,

146
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,850
you should improve your needlework.

147
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes, My Lord.

148
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,610
If you don't mind,

149
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,000
would you try the size?

150
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,050
It's just a belt.

151
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,120
No need to try it.

152
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,250
I'll try it later.

153
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,690
Let's eat.

154
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,380
(Wei Mansion)

155
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,060
(Wei Mansion)

156
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,840
Whenever you have something
on your mind,

157
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,440
you always ask me to keep you company.

158
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,800
But today,

159
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,840
I truly can't drink this tea.

160
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,250
You may skip the tea,

161
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,370
but I still need to trouble you

162
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,770
for some advice.

163
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,800
Are you trying to ask about the Lady?

164
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
How did you know?

165
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,440
She also came to see me a few days ago.

166
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,200
What did you tell her?

167
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,800
Since you and she are husband and wife,

168
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,290
you are the closest of kin.

169
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,680
In that case,

170
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,010
why scheme against each other?

171
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,130
Then from now on,

172
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,530
I will never hurt her again.

173
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,480
But the Qiao Clan's crimes

174
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,170
are unforgivable.

175
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
Yes, put it here.

176
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,230
Hurry up there.

177
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,490
Put it here.

178
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,090
Hurry up.

179
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,310
That cart.

180
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,410
Get everything done asap.

181
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,320
(Government Office)

182
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,650
Hurry up. Move faster.

183
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,170
What's going on?

184
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,560
My Lord, commoners have come
to see you off.

185
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,490
See me off?

186
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,170
You personally go

187
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,480
to inspect canal work.

188
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,320
We should handle it properly

189
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
so the people can see

190
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,480
that you love the people.

191
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,930
When are you leaving?

192
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,870
We'll see you off.

193
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,410
Do you

194
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,770
want me to leave?

195
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:47,730
No.

196
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,960
You're going far,

197
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,130
so we're going to see you off.

198
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,600
The wine is here! The wine is here!

199
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,350
The wine is here! The wine is here!

200
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,290
The wine is here, My Lord.

201
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,370
The wine is here.

202
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,930
If you're so happy,

203
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,770
you should

204
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,930
go by yourself.

205
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,480
My Lord, I didn't say I was happy.

206
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,770
It's the perfect opportunity

207
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,230
for you to get some real experience.

208
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,930
I'm still young, My Lord.

209
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,320
I've never handled a task on my own.

210
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
I'm not good enough for this.

211
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,680
Go through it once,

212
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,050
and you'll grow.

213
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,280
It's settled, then.

214
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,770
Yes.

215
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,200
Do you all want to go too?

216
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,370
- No.
- We're mature enough.

217
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,210
That's right.

218
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,080
My Lord, the Lady sent this belt
and some dessert

219
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
for you to eat on the road.

220
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,480
I'll take the belt.

221
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,080
Take this.

222
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,130
Eat it on the way.

223
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,930
My Lord, the Lady prepared it for you.

224
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,370
Why don't you come with me?

225
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,560
You take it.
I'll go home for a warm meal.

226
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Bye.

227
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,370
Go as instructed.

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,580
It means the Lord values you
and wants to train you.

229
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:58,970
Go on.

230
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,080
Wait for me to return.

231
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,130
Do your best.

232
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm starving.

233
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,730
Let's eat together.

234
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,480
Chunniang, set another place
at the table.

235
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,320
Yes.

236
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,080
Was the food I sent not to your liking?

237
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,890
No.

238
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,370
I've sent Wei Duo
to supervise the canal repairs.

239
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,600
He took the dessert

240
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,770
for the road.

241
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,560
It seems your cold

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,930
is already cured.

243
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,130
Just stay home and rest.

244
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,250
Don't rush around

245
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,200
to exhaust yourself.

246
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,840
You're the most thoughtful

247
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,650
and smooth-tongued

248
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,720
in the entire household.

249
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,410
You flatter me, My Lord.

250
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,210
By the way,

251
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,720
Grandmother's birthday

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,200
is coming soon.

253
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,930
Mother handled it every year,

254
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,320
but she can't do it this time.

255
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,960
You should handle it.

256
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,220
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

257
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,940
(Su Ehuang, Lady of Bianzhou)

258
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,340
(Chen Xiang, Governor of Bianzhou)

259
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,320
How could you stand by and watch

260
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,560
the Qiao Clan flag rise over Boya?

261
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
You even lost Xiaogang too.

262
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,560
You were once a famed general,

263
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,930
yet you lost to a stable hand.

264
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,840
How humiliating!

265
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,160
My Lord,

266
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,080
I failed in my duty.

267
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
Please punish me.

268
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,570
Darling, don't get upset.
It's not good for your health.

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,320
Right now, we need capable people.

270
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,770
Why not

271
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,170
set this matter aside for now

272
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,560
and give him a chance to redeem himself?

273
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Thank you, My Lord.

274
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,010
Thank you, My Lady.

275
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,680
Here.

276
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,700
Now that Wei and Yanzhou

277
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,560
have formed an alliance,

278
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,840
this won't be easy.

279
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,130
Since Li Su died in battle,

280
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,290
Bianzhou has lacked good generals.

281
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,010
Our forces

282
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,650
can't match Wei's strength.

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,600
We shouldn't engage them head-on
for now.

284
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,080
You're wise, My Lady.

285
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,410
I've carried an empress's fate
since birth.

286
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
A seer once said

287
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,170
I'd marry the ruler
of the Central Plains.

288
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,650
Naturally, I must be able to assist him.

289
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,800
You are remarkable.

290
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,930
It's me who's not good enough

291
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,250
to be your husband.

292
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,650
How could you be so pessimistic?

293
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,940
Though I've married you,

294
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,650
I haven't had any children.

295
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,050
I was thinking:

296
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,130
If we could adopt a child

297
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,010
who's both talented and handsome

298
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,010
and have you raise him,

299
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,680
it might ease your burdens sooner.

300
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,800
That doesn't matter.

301
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,560
I have Uncle's support now.

302
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,370
Xiang.

303
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,370
Uncle.

304
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,130
Greetings, My Lord.

305
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,440
Darling.

306
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,600
Are you

307
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,050
feeling better now?

308
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,740
I've sent people to other places

309
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,900
in search of physicians skilled
in treating coughs.

310
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,600
(Chen Pang, Prefect of Danjun)
They should

311
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,080
arrive soon.

312
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,250
Uncle,

313
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,330
with my wife caring for me,

314
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,480
you don't need to worry too much.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,930
Ever since Lady Su

316
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,480
married you,

317
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,170
Bianzhou has suffered
defeat after defeat,

318
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,720
and our influence is fading by the day.

319
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,410
Now, even you have fallen ill.

320
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
I must ask:

321
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,440
Lady Su, is your forehead mark

322
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,260
meant to bring fortune to Bianzhou

323
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,610
or disaster?

324
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,040
You make a fair point.

325
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,580
(Su Zixin, Su Ehuang's cousin)
Ehuang.

326
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,330
Has the Lord

327
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,970
agreed to the adoption?

328
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,040
It's still under discussion.

329
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,330
But the envoy from Wushan

330
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,890
mentioned this specifically.

331
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,370
So what?

332
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,850
Did he refuse?

333
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,130
He's seriously ill.

334
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,040
What if...

335
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,100
Nothing will happen to him.

336
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,470
What we should worry about now
is Chen Pang.

337
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,440
Though he's the Lord's uncle,

338
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,520
he's never respected me

339
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,370
and keeps challenging my empress's fate.

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,480
Keep an eye on Lady Su.

341
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,130
If she shows any sign of disloyalty
to Bianzhou,

342
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,370
report to me at once.

343
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,210
Yes.

344
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,610
My Lady,

345
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,650
we can't mess up
Lady Xu's birthday banquet.

346
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,960
But we don't know a thing about it.

347
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
What do we do?

348
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,040
We may not know,

349
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,810
but there are those who do.

350
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,480
My Lady,

351
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,120
the banquet arrangements

352
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,510
have mostly followed

353
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,680
your instructions.

354
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,570
There are a few details.

355
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,480
Do you want them done differently
this year?

356
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,410
Go away.

357
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,760
Don't bother me.

358
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,040
Put the preparations

359
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,920
on hold.

360
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,890
You may go.

361
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,370
Yes. I'll take my leave.

362
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,720
It took me a long time

363
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
to figure out just a fraction

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,720
of Mother's preferences.

365
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,810
She's new here.

366
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,950
How can she know better than me?

367
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,610
Fine.

368
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,170
Let her handle it

369
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,440
so she can get a taste

370
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
of the hardship I once endured.

371
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,410
My Lady,

372
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,680
no need to fret.

373
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,170
She's only been here a short while.

374
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,720
She definitely doesn't know much.

375
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,480
Let her take charge.

376
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,000
If anything goes wrong,

377
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,890
it won't be our fault.

378
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,170
We'll get to relax.

379
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,890
Here, have some tea.

380
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,850
Greetings, Mother.

381
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,280
You've served Grandmother for years.

382
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,410
Surely, no one knows

383
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,090
her preferences better than you.

384
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,720
Of course.

385
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,330
I've just joined the family

386
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,480
and know very little.

387
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,270
So, I'd like to learn from you.

388
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,500
(Banquet Procedures)

389
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,240
What do you want to learn from me?

390
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,170
You're clever-tongued

391
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,520
and good with words and deeds.

392
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,650
What could I possibly teach you?

393
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,760
I'm someone meticulous.

394
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,200
Mother,

395
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,040
the reason the banquet
was entrusted to me

396
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,890
was that the Lord feared
it'd tire you out.

397
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,810
If the banquet goes poorly,

398
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,520
Grandmother won't be pleased,

399
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,410
and none of us will be at ease.

400
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,370
At least you know your place.

401
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,040
Besides,

402
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,760
many members of the clan will attend.

403
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,280
If things aren't arranged properly,

404
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,130
it'll bring shame to the Lord's name.

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,130
That won't do.

406
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,170
Exactly.

407
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,090
So,

408
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,720
I'd be grateful if you could tell me

409
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,280
the usual procedures from past years.

410
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,040
I'll be sure to tell the Lord

411
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,410
and Grandmother

412
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,620
it's thanks to your guidance.

413
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,930
If things go well,

414
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,810
you'll be praised for teaching me well.

415
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,330
If they don't,

416
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,680
I'll shoulder the blame myself.

417
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,370
Then follow this.

418
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,370
Don't give those clan members
any laughingstock.

419
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,250
Besides,

420
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,850
make sure that man

421
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,330
doesn't steal Zhonglin's thunder.

422
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,850
That man.

423
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,200
That man?

424
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,780
That would be the Lord's cousin,

425
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Mr. Wei.

426
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,370
They say he's the illegitimate son

427
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,960
of the Lord's aunt and a servant.

428
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,130
Though his birth is dubious,

429
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,650
he bears the surname of the late lord.

430
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,810
Lady Xu adores him.

431
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,200
He only established his residence
in later years.

432
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,130
I heard from Wei Liang

433
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,810
that Mr. Wei's been traveling nonstop
these years.

434
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,370
He only sends gifts back

435
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,850
during holidays.

436
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,610
So, he didn't even make it back
for your wedding.

437
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,170
So, I should call him Cousin
like the Lord does.

438
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,930
What kind of man is he?

439
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,520
Mr. Wei was wild from a young age,

440
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,280
always carousing
in taverns and brothels.

441
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,890
Rumor has it that half the women here
have ties with him.

442
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,000
If he returns to Yujun,

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,760
the men here better watch out.

444
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,240
No wonder

445
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,130
the women on the streets

446
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,960
have been wearing

447
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,810
heavier makeup lately.

448
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,510
Mr. Wei,

449
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,520
what new fancy things
have you brought this time?

450
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,000
Just the things you love.

451
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,090
Mr. Wei,

452
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,090
come and join us!

453
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,330
Get the drinks and dishes ready.

454
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,330
I'll be there soon.

455
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,370
- Don't forget!
- Yes!

456
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,610
They say he doesn't just flirt outside.

457
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,570
He's got a harem at home too.

458
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,520
He's a total playboy.

459
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,440
Luckily, he rarely stays at the mansion.

460
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,370
Out of ten days, he spends seven
in brothels and taverns,

461
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,960
and only three at home.

462
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Two sprouts from the same field,

463
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,280
two men from the same house.

464
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,170
Luckily,

465
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,610
the Lord isn't like him.

466
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,080
He's truly different.

467
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,440
Forget it. Let's not gossip.

468
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,240
The less we deal with him,
the less trouble we'll have.

469
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,200
Let's just focus
on preparing the banquet.

470
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,250
Yes.

471
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,540
(Government Office)

472
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,810
He's back. He's back.

473
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,040
Mr. Wei.

474
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,280
Lady Xu sent us to welcome you home.

475
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,960
Greetings, Mr. Wei.

476
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,720
Welcome back.

477
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,780
(Wei Yan, Wei Shao's cousin)

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,130
You haven't changed a bit
in these three years.

479
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,570
What miracle elixir did you take?

480
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,370
Mr. Wei,

481
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,480
please don't tease me.

482
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,130
Lady Xu's waiting for you.

483
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,410
It's my fault

484
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,450
for keeping her waiting.

485
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,310
I'll go in right away

486
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,170
to apologize.

487
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,370
Yes, I'll go inform Lady Xu now.

488
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,240
Mother.

489
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,570
Something must be holding Shiyuan up.

490
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,440
No use getting anxious.

491
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,850
He came back for my birthday.

492
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,040
If you can't wait,

493
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,200
you're free to go.

494
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,440
Grandmother.

495
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,680
Grandmother.

496
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,330
Your unfilial grandson is back.

497
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,040
Greetings, Grandmother.

498
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,960
Hurry, hurry. Get up.

499
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,330
Let me take a look at you.

500
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
You've gotten thinner

501
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,090
and more worn out.

502
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,570
Many young ladies say
I'm as handsome as ever.

503
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,930
Yet I can't win your favor.

504
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,760
You must've seen
many charming young men

505
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,890
while I was away

506
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,200
these past three years.

507
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,410
Still the same smooth talker.

508
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,090
The same smooth talker.

509
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,960
Smooth talker.

510
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,570
How is your health?

511
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,930
Everything's good.

512
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,170
Greetings, Aunt.

513
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,410
Zhonglin,

514
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,130
how have you been?

515
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,200
Everything is fine.

516
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,280
I heard you married

517
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,650
an extremely pretty wife.

518
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,660
Why didn't you bring her

519
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,720
to meet me?

520
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,760
Shiyuan is talking nonsense again.

521
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,810
Lady Qiao's been busy preparing

522
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,200
Grandmother's birthday banquet.

523
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,960
I'll bring her

524
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,810
to greet you later.

525
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,130
Good thing you mentioned the banquet.

526
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,730
Come.

527
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,440
I've brought gifts
for all our relatives.

528
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,000
These are for you.

529
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Wait.

530
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,000
I've also got something

531
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,680
for you two.

532
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,360
Here.

533
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,930
This is for you.

534
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,370
This one's for you.

535
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,280
Thank you, Grandmother.

536
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,000
Open them.

537
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,850
This is a pair of rough jade

538
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,040
given to me by your grandfather

539
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,670
when I married him.

540
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,690
Today,

541
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm passing them on to you two.

542
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,130
Thank you, Grandmother.

543
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,520
It's a precious gift.

544
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,850
Keep it well.

545
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,740
- We will.
- Mother

546
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,040
just dotes on Shiyuan.

547
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,930
Even Zhonglin

548
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,170
benefits from it.

549
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,200
Shiyuan, while you were away,

550
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,260
your grandmother

551
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,650
didn't even give away

552
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,170
a stone,

553
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,200
let alone rough jade, right?

554
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,930
I'm in a good mood today.

555
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,440
Don't push it.

556
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,040
Have a seat.

557
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,930
Alright.

558
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,570
Make sure all gifts
from the states and prefectures

559
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,580
are recorded properly.

560
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,330
Every item must be matched
with the sender.

561
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,760
No mistakes are allowed.

562
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,370
Rest assured, My Lady.

563
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,720
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

564
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,720
Have you picked a birthday gift

565
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,720
for Grandmother?

566
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,170
I've been looking

567
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,960
but haven't found the right one.

568
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,410
Take a look at this.

569
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,520
It's rough jade.

570
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,200
It was a treasure of Grandmother's,

571
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,200
but she gave it to me today.

572
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,280
It wouldn't be proper for me

573
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,520
to keep it,

574
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,680
so find a skilled artisan

575
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,810
to make it into an accessory.

576
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,200
We'll give it back to her

577
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,650
as a birthday gift.

578
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,440
I've never seen rough jade before,

579
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,570
but this looks pure and translucent.

580
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,040
It's surely fine material.

581
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,650
How about a jade bracelet?

582
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,150
Grandmother would definitely love it.

583
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,520
I'll leave it to you.

584
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,720
Thank you for solving my problem.

585
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
When did I solve your problem?

586
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,330
I'm doing this to please Grandmother.

587
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,710
Don't get the wrong idea.

588
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,930
I have other matters. I'm leaving.

589
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,240
Why such a strong denial?

590
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,890
Hello, sir.

591
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,280
Hi, Miss Xiaotao.

592
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,860
I have a big order for you today.

593
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,330
Make a bracelet

594
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,370
for our lady.

595
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Greetings, My Lady.

596
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,610
Wow.

597
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,280
Such fine quality.

598
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,070
I was lucky to see this once

599
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,330
when I was still an apprentice.

600
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,190
See?

601
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,090
You really haven't seen
much of the world.

602
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,200
My Lady, are you keeping it

603
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,370
or giving it as a gift?

604
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,000
What style do you want?

605
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,410
It's a gift for an elder at home.

606
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,770
Please carve a blessing bracelet

607
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,090
featuring the dragon and phoenix.

608
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,650
I'll have to give it some thought.

609
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,680
Be careful. Don't drop it.

610
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,850
Be careful.

611
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,720
How is it? Are you okay?

612
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,570
I told you not to drop it.

613
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,450
I'm terribly sorry.

614
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,530
Please forgive me, My Lady.

615
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,400
Alright.

616
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,170
Check if the crack affects the pattern.

617
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,200
The pattern

618
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,330
the Lady wants is delicate.

619
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,720
A crack this big

620
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,090
won't do.

621
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,930
How can you do this?

622
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,570
That guy should be blamed too.

623
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,410
How can he ride on the street now?

624
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,040
What a waste.

625
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,930
It's really my fault.

626
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,850
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,130
Please allow me

628
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,090
to make it up to you.

629
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,170
Come inside and fix it then.

630
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,760
You're kind not to mind,

631
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,930
but I can't let it slide.

632
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,000
Let me see.

633
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,440
It's top-quality jade.

634
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,850
It'll be a pity to waste
such fine material.

635
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,090
Let me think.

636
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,090
Since it's a gift for an elder,

637
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,930
the lotus Buddha design,

638
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,960
while not as intricate
as the dragon and phoenix,

639
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,090
carries a meaning of blessing.

640
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,040
It might make up for it.

641
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,410
Looks good.

642
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,760
Sir, please take care.

643
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,650
Watch it closely. Don't drop it again.

644
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,330
Be careful this time.

645
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,650
Thanks for the advice, sir.

646
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,570
No problem.

647
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,330
I just happen

648
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,130
to have a new hairpin ready

649
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,910
that needs to go with a high hair bun.

650
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,850
If you

651
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,960
want to thank me,

652
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,280
please try it on.

653
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,040
You're stunning.

654
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,370
This hairpin

655
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,610
suits you perfectly.

656
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,480
Do you think it fits me?

657
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,200
If the Lady isn't interested,

658
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,370
I won't insist.

659
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,570
Mr. Wei, goodbye.

660
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
Wei?

661
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,040
Which Wei?

662
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,810
How many Weis are there in Yujun?

663
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,200
This is Mr. Wei?

664
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,410
A real rake.

665
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,610
I heard as soon as he arrived in Yujun,

666
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,090
he took many concubines.

667
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,630
(Wei Yan's Mansion, Wei State)

668
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,040
Mr. Wei is kind

669
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,330
and easy to get along with.

670
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,570
But when you serve him at the mansion,

671
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,960
you must be extra careful.

672
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
This isn't a tavern.

673
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,520
He doesn't like flashy or vulgar things,

674
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,370
so you need to pay attention

675
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,240
to your clothes

676
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,280
and makeup.

677
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,000
- Understand?
- Mr. Wei is back.

678
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,440
Mr. Wei is back.

679
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,510
Mr. Wei is back.

680
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,570
Take them to their rooms.

681
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,430
I'll go greet Mr. Wei.

682
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,270
Yes.

683
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,490
Please follow me.

684
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,020
(Lanyun, singer)

685
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,370
Let's go.

686
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,610
What's this?

687
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,650
My Lady.

688
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,240
Isn't this the orchid from Yanzhou?

689
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
Yes.

690
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,680
Mr. Wei brought gifts

691
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,370
for all the relatives on this trip.

692
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,580
Knowing that you've been in Yujun
for a while

693
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,560
and might feel homesick,

694
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,620
he had someone pick out

695
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,410
three pots of orchids for you

696
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,000
when passing through Yanzhou.

697
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,280
Unfortunately,

698
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,960
two pots died on the bumpy road,

699
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
and only this last one remains,

700
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,810
so I'm here to present it to you.

701
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,930
Please pass on my gratitude to him.

702
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,320
Yes.

703
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,930
It looks

704
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,130
like he picked it carefully.

705
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,480
Such a plant is rare

706
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,170
even in the whole of Yanzhou.

707
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,200
The flowers are nice,

708
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,920
but he's not so great.

709
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,040
Many rich young masters

710
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,960
have strange quirks.

711
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,610
A man like the Lord

712
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,810
is rare.

713
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,850
Find a good gardener

714
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,000
to care for it.

715
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,170
Alright.

716
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,890
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

717
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,240
Okay, I'll record it later.

718
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,410
Then I'll take my leave.

719
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,570
Done. Go then.

720
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Aunt sent a pair
of white jade bracelets.

721
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,680
Let me put them here.

722
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,240
Among so many birthday gifts,

723
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,850
our bracelet is the most beautiful.

724
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,170
Of course.

725
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,200
Don't talk nonsense.

726
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,810
The gifts from the states
are all excellent,

727
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,760
but our rough jade is truly precious,

728
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,370
so the bracelet made
is even more exquisite.

729
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,570
It's obvious that the Lord wants
to gain favor for you

730
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,200
in front of Lady Xu.

731
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,850
He just wants to please Grandmother.

732
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,210
Are all the gifts for the birthday here?

733
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes, right here.

734
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,340
The Lady is here.

735
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,410
Put the gifts on the shelf.

736
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,330
The Lady?

737
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,850
Lady Qiao is here?

738
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,370
I'm Zhonglin's cousin.

739
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,960
Sorry for the trouble today.

740
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,690
Zhonglin will introduce me later,

741
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,410
and then I'll formally greet you.

742
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,440
You must be Mr. Wei.

743
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,560
I haven't thanked you
for the orchids yet.

744
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It's nothing.

745
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,160
Don't mention it.

746
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,160
Well.

747
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,600
I'll just

748
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,250
leave this...

749
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,810
I'll just leave this

750
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,160
here.

751
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,480
Make sure to take it when you leave.

752
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,960
Grandmother's birthday banquet
is a big event.

753
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,120
Everyone here must be checked.

754
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,850
If anything happens,
you'll be held responsible.

755
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,710
Understood. Thanks for the reminder.

756
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:33,650
Let's go.

757
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,440
What's wrong?

758
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,730
The box for the bracelet is missing.

759
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,600
I just put it here a moment ago.

760
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,690
Where did you put it?

761
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,770
Did you put it away and forget?

762
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,080
I put it right here.

763
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,210
Keep looking.

764
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,480
Maybe you put it somewhere else.

765
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,250
I just put it right there.

766
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,210
Did you find it?

767
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,130
No.

768
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,490
The bracelet is gone.

769
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,610
This is definitely our fault.

770
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,740
Please punish us, My Lady.

771
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,690
But everyone who went in and out today

772
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,250
was carefully checked.

773
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,890
No one could've hidden anything.

774
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,640
I even saw the bracelet.

775
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,730
After that,

776
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,290
Mr. Wei came in.

777
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,810
Have you searched Mr. Wei

778
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,120
and everyone who came after?

779
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,040
Yes, we searched them all.

780
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,600
Mr. Wei even told us not to slack off.

781
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
My Lady, please believe us.

782
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,160
We would never be negligent.

783
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,330
Enough, stop talking.

784
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,250
This is the last thing we want to see.

785
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,150
My Lady,

786
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,000
this was a birthday gift
prepared by the Lord

787
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,410
for Lady Xu.

788
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,890
If it's blamed on us,

789
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,000
what will we do?

790
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,160
Maybe

791
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,700
we should keep quiet for a while.

792
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,330
Losing it is already a fault.

793
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,140
If we lie about it,

794
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,850
it will only make things worse.

795
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,770
I didn't do my job well.

796
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,480
Please punish me.

797
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,890
What's going on?

798
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,890
Get up and explain.

799
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,610
What's wrong?

800
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,110
The bracelet for Grandmother

801
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,730
is missing.

802
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,800
What happened?

803
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,160
The storeroom was checked thoroughly.

804
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,000
No one took it out without permission.

805
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,210
The guards were on duty at the door.

806
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,440
No one left with it.

807
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,960
But the bracelet is missing.

808
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,120
Everyone in the mansion now knows

809
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,410
you are going to give Grandmother
a bracelet.

810
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,810
Yet it's missing at this moment.

811
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,960
If Grandmother is disappointed,

812
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,370
it's all my fault.

813
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,160
Please punish me.

814
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,890
It's not so serious.

815
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
Don't worry. The storeroom is guarded.

816
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,850
It couldn't have gone missing.

817
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,890
Tomorrow,

818
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,160
we'll search more carefully.

819
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,480
Besides, so what if it's lost?

820
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,730
Don't dwell on it.

821
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,850
Oh, I have something
to do at the office.

822
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,690
I need to go out.

823
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,640
Did the Lord just scold you?

824
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,600
Why does he look so unconcerned?

825
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,570
Cousin.

826
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,160
What's going on?

827
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,930
Why the panic?

828
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,210
Give me rough jade

829
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,080
from Grandmother.

830
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,480
Don't you have one yourself?

831
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,810
I do,

832
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,960
but I had someone make it
into a bracelet.

833
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,120
I wanted to give it
to Grandmother as a gift,

834
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,690
but I lost it.

835
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,850
Lost it?

836
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,160
Who was responsible?

837
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,290
Lady Qiao.

838
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,080
She's the Lady of Wei,

839
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,000
yet she can't handle such a small thing?

840
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,640
No, she's normally careful,

841
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,330
but this time...

842
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,040
It was really an accident.

843
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,520
Now, you're just covering for her.

844
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,370
Listen to me.

845
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,340
Do you know

846
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,280
how important this is?

847
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,560
Enough, just give it to me.

848
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,520
I need it now.

849
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,570
Hurry.

850
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,520
Wait.

851
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,600
You're taking my jade

852
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,410
to make a bracelet

853
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,210
and fix Lady Qiao's mistake,

854
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,040
so we need to recalculate the accounts.

855
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,960
Brothers don't keep score,

856
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,370
right?

857
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,730
No, no. Look.

858
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,600
You're taking my jade
to make a bracelet,

859
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,930
so I won't get it back.

860
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,210
Lady Qiao said

861
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,640
the bracelet might not be lost.

862
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,600
When we find it,

863
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,080
we'll return it.

864
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,290
This must be investigated seriously.

865
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,370
Go ahead.

866
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,900
(Jade Artifacts)

867
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,370
Who's there?

868
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,330
How strange.

869
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,250
How could things go missing

870
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,330
in our own house?

871
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,560
Was there a thief?

872
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,810
Lady Qiao, are you here?

873
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,370
Cousin.

874
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,250
Please forgive me for coming uninvited.

875
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,560
I heard

876
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
that Zhonglin's precious bracelet
was lost that day.

877
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,250
I happened to be at the storeroom too,

878
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,560
so I wanted

879
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,480
to help you search.

880
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,080
Thanks a lot, Cousin.

881
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,440
Lady Qiao, don't worry.

882
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,930
This mansion is heavily guarded.

883
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,290
Such an important item

884
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,410
can't get lost.

885
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,160
Maybe it was

886
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,330
accidentally left somewhere.

887
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,640
Lady Qiao, take a look.

888
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,690
Is this the bracelet?

889
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,480
That's it.

890
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,480
Where did you find it?

891
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,080
In that ceramic jar over there.

892
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,330
See?

893
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,440
I told you it wouldn't be lost.

894
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,040
Maybe someone bumped it off.

895
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,160
This rough jade is top quality,

896
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,330
and it was a gift from Grandmother.

897
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,850
If I'd lost it through carelessness,

898
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,600
I'd feel terribly guilty.

899
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:49,570
Thank you

900
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,730
for your help today.

901
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,420
No problem.

902
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,730
This rough jade

903
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,080
was from Grandfather to Grandmother

904
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,640
when she married him.

905
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,730
It really is precious material.

906
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,470
Grandmother gave it to Zhonglin,

907
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,160
so you can imagine
the meaning behind it.

908
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,160
From now on,

909
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,080
you must be extra careful

910
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,640
and not make any more mistakes.

911
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,600
You're right.

912
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,250
This rough jade

913
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,810
is truly a rare treasure.

914
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,040
Even in Yujun,

915
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,890
it's one of a kind.

916
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,560
That means

917
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,030
you must have recognized this rough jade

918
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,810
at the jewelry shop that day

919
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,000
and figured out who I was.

920
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,370
You really are clever.

921
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,740
If you knew who I was,

922
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,930
why still pretend in front of me?

923
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,210
They say the Twin Belles
of Yanzhou are stunning.

924
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,960
I just wanted to see for myself

925
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,600
and judge for myself.

926
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,250
What can you do to me?
