The Taoism Grandmaster

The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Brother, I have something to tell you.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is it?

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There is a very good place nearby.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The mountain town there is really delicious.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It would be great if we could eat there.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How do you know?

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have a good friend.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He gave me a strategy.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a strategy.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you also hope that the male and female

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
can be more quiet?

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Look at them now.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They are so hardworking.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The strategy says that

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
as long as we follow the strategy,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we can get along well.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Really?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Really.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So the first battle of the strategy

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is the sour plum soup.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Think about it.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In this hot weather,

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
having a cup of cold sour plum soup

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is so comfortable.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You are talking too much.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We are talking in a bad way.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And it's cold.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Isn't it to cool down the body?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Fine.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am hot now.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I just need to lie down.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am hot now.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I just need to lie down.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then we can eat the mountain town.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How about it?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What if there are any stupid stones on the way?

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We will come back when we fall.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We are close anyway.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It makes sense.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But now,

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the female side...

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you hear me?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Many people have used this time to fix Xu.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It will affect his future performance.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So he may not be willing to do it.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And he has a little support behind him.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me ask you.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it reliable?

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can you guarantee it?

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Can you believe it?

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You want to believe me?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Fine.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will tell the female side.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You agree?

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will go prepare.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The female side.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wei Liao.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Something happened?

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
20 miles east, 15 miles south,

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
through a forest,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
we can see a village surrounded by clouds.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Master, that's right.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is the sour plum soup.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the sour plum soup.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It smells sour.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It has become a hair salon.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Master, I know.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who said there was no sour plum soup in the hair salon?

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Madam.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Madam.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This place used to be a hair salon.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But it has been changed recently.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Since my grandfather's time,

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
this is the hair salon.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Look.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Next,

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the sour plum soup.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Madam,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
thank you.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're welcome.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hot spring.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
A car.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was a hot spring a few years ago.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Pack up your strategy.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go back quickly.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't stay here and make trouble.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Look.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The water is still warm.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This should be a spring.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How about

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we dig down?

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can't go down.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You can't go down.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't go down.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can't go down.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can't go down.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's dig down.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It should be a hot spring.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Master.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where are you going?

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm going to get my clothes.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Dig down and call me.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Master.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't trust me?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't trust my own judgment.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Master, give me another chance.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll take you to a good place.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Look.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're walking 20 miles west.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's the Chaoying Road.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We'll stay there for a few days.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then we'll eat the ginseng there.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then we'll go into the cave.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me see.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Where did you say we should go?

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The west.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go east.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We'll go to the sea.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's here.

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Master.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's water.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Master.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is the sea of water.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Look.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come and play.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The sea is chasing me.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's play.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Master.

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You've seen it.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A shell.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A shell.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Isn't this just a normal sea?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What sea of dead loach?

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where did you get the strategy?

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It has nothing to do with the strategy.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tell me the truth.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Who gave you the idea?

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you know that Qilin?

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She has a guardian of Geng.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We're friends.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know if she gave me the music.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How could it be like this?

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're still from the Xia family.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Tell your friend Geng.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What kind of friend is he?

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What kind of person is he?

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What kind of person is he?

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Stay away from him.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's go.

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll go too.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can play here for a while.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Play for a while.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll play with you.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Little shell.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Go and play.

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go down and swim for a while.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Master.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There's a grasshopper house over there.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you want to go there?

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Master.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll teach you two a lesson.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you remember what you taught me?

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, I remember.

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's good.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
General.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
General didn't go back to the Han army.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Leave.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You haven't been serious about the war.

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't know the trouble is here.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's the trouble you're talking about?

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A group of people from the bamboo palace

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
have come to the Maizhou of Yanzhou

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to meet Long Jun.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Those who are familiar with the birthday banquet?

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then Yanzhou sent a new group of people.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What good will it be for the Minister of Defense to worship you?

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master heard that Qiao Nu

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
was going to plant seeds of Yanzhou

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
on the land of Wei.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Master has been caught by Qiao Nu.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If I had known this,

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I would have met Master

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when we were celebrating the ceremony.

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The best is to meet one and not the other.

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If it's to send the seeds,

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
why did Master come personally?

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Anything else?

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
According to the guard of Yujin,

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
they came to Long Jun

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to suppress the Maizhou.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In fact, they extended the Yongnong District

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
from Xindou to Long Jun.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Although they are planting seeds,

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you and I know that

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Long Jun is far from Yujin

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to keep the family's prestige and honor

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
of the Jun's hand for many years.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If the Qu family is built,

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
then Long Jun will have a close contact

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
with the local people.

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Long Jun is the real descendant of the Wei family.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is to weaken local power.

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Master and Yujin

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
will know that sooner or later

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
there will be this day.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How should I respond?

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What's the problem with this?

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can guarantee that

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
they will not be surprised on this journey.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Nanjun is a headache.

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How about I help Nanjun

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to solve the problem by pressing the acupoint?

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
OK.

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But my hands are too cold.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But the acupoint

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
can increase the acupoint.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Nanjun, don't panic.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
OK.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Nanjun, relax.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm here to teach you

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
how to grow

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the most important plant in Yan State.

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But the most important thing

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is to send you to Nanjun.

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't want to be alone

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in your family

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
for too long

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
because you are a foreign student.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Aren't you afraid

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that I'll send you back

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
after you teach me?

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm here to take care of you.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm here to help you.

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm here to help you.

281
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm here to help you.

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm not a man.

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't fight with you.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,500
I don't want to stay in the

285
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
school.

286
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
If you want me to go back,

287
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
you can still send me back

288
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
when I arrive at Rongjun.

289
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I'll follow your words

290
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
wherever I go.

291
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Nanjun.

292
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I just

295
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
want to be closer to you.

296
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I wish

297
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
I could be with you.

298
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I'd like to cross the sea and go to your garden.

329
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Waiting for the white snow to appear.

330
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
The road is hard to walk.

331
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I'm falling at your beautiful profile.

332
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Heart is sad.

333
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I'd like to see you again.

334
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Xiaoliu.

335
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Master.

336
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Can you give me another chance?

337
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
No chance.

338
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I wish I could be with you.

339
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,980
I'll sacrifice my life for you.

340
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,700
Wait for me.

341
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,220
See if Yu Jing is looking at us.

342
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,220
No.

343
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,780
Everyone, be careful.

344
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,020
Be careful.

345
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,700
Protect Ning Que.

346
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,620
Yes.

347
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,460
Protect Wu Jun.

348
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,460
Ning Que.

349
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,620
Do you know who we are?

350
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,420
Captain,

351
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,980
roofs are transparent.

352
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,420
Is it along your base?

353
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,460
Wish them all were yours.

354
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,020
Go.

355
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,540
Yes.

356
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,420
った

357
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,380
Go go go

358
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,780
What should we do?

359
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
utest

360
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,560
Go

361
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,180
I'll hold you in an air Bundesland

362
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,800
Hurry

363
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,740
Burn your sword

364
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,260
Retreat

365
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,700
I'll go and say I can help you.

366
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,420
Nanjun.

367
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
You're hurt.

368
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,140
It's nothing. It's just a small injury.

369
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,940
Let's go.

370
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,180
Nanjun.

371
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,460
Nanjun.

372
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,140
Nanjun.

373
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,020
Nanjun.

374
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:31,500
Nanjun.

375
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,500
Nanjun.

376
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,340
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,140
There's poison on the arrowhead.

378
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,980
But the poison was just rubbed on the skin.

379
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,900
The main character is strong.

380
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,860
There's no danger of life.

381
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,100
But

382
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,740
the poison is almost gone

383
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,060
and he can wake up.

384
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:22,180
Do you know

385
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,940
as well as ordinary thieves?

386
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,540
They know how to play it.

387
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,460
They look like soldiers trained in 사랐습니다.

388
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,420
What do you mean?

389
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,580
Think about

390
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,980
what these people

391
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
send from Rongzhong?

392
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,660
Nanjun told me so.

393
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,540
He doesn't have the nerve to do that,

394
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,940
but he is good with Imperial Guards.

395
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,780
If this mission succeeds,

396
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,500
it will surely shake the foundation of Rong Jun's power.

397
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,620
This will also damage the interests of the Wei Dian.

398
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,420
General, do you think

399
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,380
Wei Dian will send people to ambush Nan Juan?

400
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,220
Yes.

401
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Wei Dian has always been unfaithful to his master.

402
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,340
He must have taken this opportunity to frame his master.

403
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,780
I'll kill him now!

404
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,660
I'll go too!

405
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,060
No.

406
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,540
We're just suspecting him, but we don't have any evidence.

407
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,580
If we break his face now,

408
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,860
he will say that we framed Zhong Chen.

409
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,420
Wei Dian is a loyal official.

410
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,740
We all know what he thinks.

411
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,820
But the people don't.

412
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,580
Moreover, we're on his territory now.

413
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,300
If he is so anxious to jump the wall

414
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,380
and frame Nan Juan's reputation, that won't be good.

415
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,900
It will also be more difficult to get him to confess.

416
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,340
What should we do then?

417
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,180
Master's health condition now

418
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,380
is not good for long-distance travel.

419
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,820
Fortunately, we're not out for long.

420
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,860
Why don't we go back first?

421
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,940
Let Master rest well.

422
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,540
It's not good to rest on the way.

423
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,260
Moreover, if we retreat now,

424
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,140
these people will think that this is a good opportunity.

425
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,860
They will be careful next time.

426
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,020
And the best time to plant the wheat is coming soon.

427
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,740
If we miss it,

428
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,260
we will lose our lives.

429
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,100
So wheat must be planted in autumn.

430
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,420
It's a big problem for the people.

431
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,340
The same goes for the rice field.

432
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,420
If the rice field is different, the people will suffer.

433
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,300
Ming Jun, I'm just worried

434
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,580
that we're in danger before we arrive at Rong Jun.

435
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,700
We don't know what will happen when we arrive at Rong Jun.

436
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,780
How about this? You take Master back to rest.

437
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,580
I'll go with you.

438
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,980
I understand your concern.

439
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,140
But it's more dangerous to stay here.

440
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
We don't care about this place.

441
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,500
Wei Dian dares to send people to assassinate Nan Jun because of this.

442
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,740
Why don't we take Rong Jun as our own?

443
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,860
Even if Wei Dian dares to do it,

444
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,700
Rong Jun won't have the courage to do it.

445
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,300
Card throttle investigation!

446
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
You…

447
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,540
Cheers.

448
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,940
Dennis.

449
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,900
I guess you knew

450
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,220
Envy is a hot tip

451
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,940
to get her attention.

452
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,500
How kind of her

453
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,340
to make a serious article

454
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,020
You...

455
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,900
You've been unconscious for two days.

456
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,380
The arrow is poisoned.

457
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,460
Where is it?

458
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,860
We've arrived at the central army.

459
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,700
By the way,

460
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,180
how is the female soldier? Is she all right?

461
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,380
She's fine.

462
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,140
She's a kind woman.

463
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,100
She's affected by the pulse.

464
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,740
Yes.

465
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,660
The pulse needs to be planted in autumn.

466
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,260
It can be harvested in May next year.

467
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
It can be cured in a year.

468
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,780
The pulse is not picked up.

469
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,580
Why did you choose Rong Jun?

470
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,900
Rong Jun has severe cold.

471
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
He's waiting for the cure.

472
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,060
As long as the pulse is corrected,

473
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,540
the people will no longer worry about famine.

474
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,940
But I heard that pulse is not a disease.

475
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,060
Most of the people who are affected by Rong Jun's recovery

476
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,340
are the people with cold.

477
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
The female soldier's method seems to be feasible.

478
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,780
But it's ridiculous.

479
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,100
The pulse is not patient.

480
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,780
In terms of water supply,

481
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,740
it's twice as much as the pulse

482
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,780
that Rong Jun planted.

483
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,780
But the Yongning Army

484
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,300
will be repaired from the capital to Rong Jun soon.

485
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,820
The water supply is perfect.

486
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,980
The weather is good.

487
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,780
You don't have to worry about the harvest.

488
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,340
The pulse is harvested.

489
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,700
Can the female soldier guarantee it?

490
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,540
The pulse has been planted in Yanzhou.

491
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
The harvest is high.

492
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,660
The high and low is just a sentence of the female soldier.

493
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,940
I've been the commander of Rong Jun for many years.

494
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,860
I can't let the people of Rong Jun

495
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,100
take risks because of a female soldier's words.

496
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,380
Are you refusing to be the commander?

497
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:27,860
I dare not.

498
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm just thinking for the people

499
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,580
and expressing my opinion.

500
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,020
If the master orders to correct the pulse,

501
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,260
we can only listen to the order.

502
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,100
It depends on whether the public opinion

503
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,780
is important to the master.

504
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,220
Why do you need a second- Carry out the mutiny as specifically as possible?

505
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,380
I didn't hear of it previously.

506
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm doing this after being punished by the death of my protector.

507
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,140
If there were nothing else,

508
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,500
please go back.

509
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,740
In the end,

510
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,620
modern virtue

511
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,540
holidays in our country,

512
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,140
officers and troops

513
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:25,540
have been

514
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,100
there.

515
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,820
We're not a chance of

516
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,100
leaving,

517
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,540
so why not

518
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
come here?

519
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,660
Normally,

520
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:37,700
we're a place

521
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,020
for that 늪 iç

522
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,500
that I can</ someone else in Asuntan.

523
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:40,860
Imagine

524
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,500
Rong Jun has a wind-blown grass hole.

525
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,180
The target will be out.

526
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,100
Now the decision-making is not good for us.

527
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,020
Is there no other way?

528
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,220
Let me think about it.

529
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,780
Rong Jun.

530
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,540
What is he up to?

531
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,460
What's his plan?

532
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,740
Hu Rong wakes up

533
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,260
and has soup in bed,

534
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,700
out of blue.

535
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:53,580
God of Weい auspiciousness

536
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,380
Xiaoduo.

537
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,860
My hand.

538
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,500
I'm fine.

539
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,340
Why do I feel that you're still burning?

540
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,220
Wei Lian.

541
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,340
I'm fine.

542
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,020
Don't worry.

543
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,540
By the way,

544
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,140
they said you saw Yuan Wang just now.

545
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,380
Yes.

546
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,380
What did he say?

547
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,820
He seemed to be against

548
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,140
the conversion of the pulse.

549
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,620
But in fact, he was against Xiuquan.

550
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,420
I just wanted to test them

551
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,940
on the spot.

552
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,820
Yuan Wang

553
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,420
has been in the army for a long time.

554
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,460
He has the help of the troops in Wei Dian.

555
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,900
How dare he be so arrogant?

556
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,660
Don't worry.

557
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,180
I'm going to send troops

558
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,180
to the army for food.

559
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
I can even pack up the enemy's goods.

560
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,580
I'm afraid I can't do it.

561
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,980
I know that the South Army is very resourceful.

562
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,500
In a few days,

563
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,180
the army of the South Army

564
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,900
will be in the hands of the army of the South.

565
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,700
But the people who are hurt

566
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,500
by the sword fight are still the people.

567
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,540
Besides, if the soldiers are transferred,

568
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,700
it's not good to miss the chance to fight.

569
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,780
If the South Army is willing to listen to me,

570
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,900
it's better to kill people than to attack.

571
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,140
How to attack?

572
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,700
I heard that the little girl wants to meet you.

573
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,500
She must want to continue to tell the story.

574
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,940
Then you know what to do.

575
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,860
I'm afraid it's natural.

576
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,500
Wei Dian is very suspicious.

577
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,540
If we start from here,

578
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,780
it's a matter of departure.

579
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,820
When the army of the South Army is alone,

580
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,580
we can only rely on the South Army.

581
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,900
When the South Army says to retire,

582
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,860
we will retire.

583
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,620
When the South Army says to take revenge,

584
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,540
we will take revenge.

585
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,420
Your Majesty,

586
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,820
the army of the South Army is here.

587
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Your Majesty.

588
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,660
I heard that the army of the South Army is good at chess.

589
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,060
Come and help me see how to break this game.

590
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,380
Please, Your Majesty.

591
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,340
The King of the South Army

592
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,580
The King of the South Army

593
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,780
The King of the South Army

594
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
The King of the South Army

595
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
The King of the South Army

596
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
The King of the South Army

597
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
The King of the South Army

598
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
The King of the South Army

599
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
The King of the South Army

600
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
The King of the South Army

601
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
The King of the South Army

602
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
The King of the South Army

603
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
The King of the South Army

604
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
The King of the South Army

605
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
The King of the South Army

606
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
The King of the South Army

607
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
The King of the South Army

608
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
The King of the South Army

609
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
The King of the South Army

610
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
The King of the South Army

611
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
The King of the South Army

612
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
The King of the South Army

613
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
The King of the South Army

614
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
The King of the South Army

615
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
The King of the South Army

616
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
The King of the South Army

617
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
The King of the South Army

618
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
You are really amazing.

619
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
I lost.

620
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
You did?

621
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
I wonder if you are free today

622
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
to play another game with me.

623
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Or do you have something else?

624
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
No.

625
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
No.

626
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
Your Majesty.

627
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
Please.

628
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Please.

629
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
Please.

630
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
Your Majesty.

631
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
It's late.

632
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Please go back.

633
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

634
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,780
Why is there one less donkey?

635
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
The wind was strong just now.

636
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,780
Maybe it was blown into the small stream by the wind.

637
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
It was blown into the small stream?

638
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
Hurry up and buy a new one.

639
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Yes.

640
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
I'm a rough person.

641
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Please don't blame me.

642
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
What did the girl

643
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
ask you for?

644
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
She just played chess.

645
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,780
She didn't say anything else.

646
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
Just play chess?

647
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
No.

648
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
I also feel strange.

649
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
I wonder what trick

650
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
the girl is playing.

651
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
She has been sitting there all day.

652
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
She is making me feel sick.

653
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
I'm going back to the mansion.

654
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
General.

655
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Keep an eye on her.

656
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Yes.

657
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,960
The

658
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
security bureau is sneaky.

659
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,780
They are afraid that people will know something.

660
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,780
They took a box of gold and silver jewelry

661
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
and entered the Commandery Minister's mansion.

662
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
It must be bribery.

663
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
General.

664
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
The female army sent someone

665
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,780
to find this donkey

666
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,780
along the river.

667
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
It's just a donkey.

668
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
Thank you for your concern.

669
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
As you expected,

670
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
there is indeed someone watching the mansion.

671
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
I will go there tonight.

672
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
The security bureau will definitely know.

673
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
If so,

674
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
please take care of the general.

675
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
I'm going.

676
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,780
Not bad.

677
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Now you really look like a female soldier.

678
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
You two generals

679
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
are not willing to cooperate with me

680
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
just because of the male soldiers.

681
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
It's good that you know.

682
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Would you like some honey?

683
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
Okay.

684
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
Wait.

685
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
I've been lying on the bed for a few days.

686
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
The smell of food is a little hard to smell.

687
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Don't come over.

688
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Do you need me to clean it for you?

689
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
It will be more comfortable to sleep in a change of clothes.

690
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
No need.

691
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
These days,

692
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
you go to another room to sleep first.

693
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Chunni.

694
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Go and prepare some hot water.

695
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
Yes.

696
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
What are you doing?

697
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
It's really useless.

698
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Does it hurt?

699
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
No.

700
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
It's okay.

701
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Xiao Gang's wound is just right.

702
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
There is a heart wound.

703
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
It doesn't hurt anymore.

704
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Don't take it to heart.

705
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
I said it was a common thing.

706
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,780
But I don't believe it's not common.

707
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,780
I hope you can be safe and healthy in the future.

708
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,780
When I am in danger,

709
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
I will die.

710
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,780
What are you going to do next?

711
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
I want to borrow two people from Nanjun.

712
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
Borrow people?

713
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Marry?

714
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Exactly.

715
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,780
The nephew of Wei Dian and the daughter of Jun Junshou have a marriage agreement.

716
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,780
To separate them,

717
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
we can only start from now on.

718
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,780
Jun Junshou and the daughter of Jun Junshou

719
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
are going to be married?

720
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
Is she pretty?

721
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
Pretty?

722
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Can you marry her?

723
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
I'll break up with you.

724
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Well.

725
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
If she's really pretty, can you not marry her?

726
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Don't talk about it.

727
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Well.

728
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
I won't marry her.

729
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
Go.

730
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Don't worry.

731
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,780
The relationship between Jun Junshou and the aunt and Wei Dian

732
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
will definitely be rejected.

733
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Such a problem?

734
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Although so,

735
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
but this matter can't be pushed back.

736
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,780
So you guys just go boldly.

737
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Let Wei Dian know.

738
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,780
The sooner, the better.

739
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
On me.

740
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
To be honest,

741
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,780
I have a marriage agreement with the nephew of Han Jun and Wei Dian.

742
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
As far as I know,

743
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Wei Dian is going to marry Wei Xia.

744
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
It's also a promise.

745
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Junshou thinks it's a promise.

746
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Wei Dian may not agree.

747
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
What do you mean?

748
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
As far as I know,

749
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Wei Dian is going to marry Wei Guojing.

750
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,780
But Wei Dian is looking for a young and beautiful girl in Wei Guojing.

751
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,780
No wonder he supports the marriage agreement.

752
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Wei Dian has done it.

753
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,780
It's okay for Junshou to leave a way for himself.

754
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,780
How about giving two generals a chance

755
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
to show them?

756
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,780
See which one is more compatible with love.

757
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,280
OK.

758
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
OK, OK.

759
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
What's it to you?

760
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Question,

761
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,780
General Wei Chu can make it.

762
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
I'm sorry.

763
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,900
Sir.

764
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,260
I'm Wei Xu.

765
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm a good cook.

766
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,180
My hobby is...

767
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,660
Yulang.

768
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:33,900
Yulang.

769
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Yulang, are you okay?

770
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Are you okay?

771
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,060
I'm fine.

772
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,620
Get up.

773
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,620
Is this your lover?

774
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,340
My daughter.

775
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,140
Leave us.

776
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,580
Even if the Queen wants to use her daughter's words to show her gratitude,

777
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:42,020
I still can't agree to change her

778
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,220
I've thought about it too much.

779
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,100
This is a matter of two.

780
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,380
Even if it's a matter of two,

781
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,580
I won't agree to it.

782
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,500
Do I love him?

783
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,380
Almost.

784
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,820
Alright.

785
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,140
I'm done.

786
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,260
Our demand is huge.

787
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,140
Ask your~~~

788
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,380
Turn down the great many status.

789
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,340
Make it as big as the competition in the world!

790
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,620
Louder!

791
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
Louder!

792
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,380
'

793
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,820
Four lines across my fingers

794
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,260
connected us inside

795
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,300
As if we've met from ancient times

796
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,260

797
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,880
Love with no hope

798
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,720
can't be beyond wish

799
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,080
Thousands years passed

800
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,360
I can't help but to fall into your eyes

801
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,440
and keep the love in my heart

802
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:58,960
I'd like to grow a smile for you

803
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,880
even if it's a stormy day

804
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,240
I don't want to be a burden for you

805
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,640
I don't want to forget you

806
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:23,960
I can cross the sea of mountains to help you

807
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,960
and wait for your hand to be in my hand

808
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,280
I can't help but to fall into your eyes

809
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,400
and keep the love in my heart

810
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
I can't help but to grow a smile for you

811
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,800
even if it's a stormy day

812
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,360
I don't want to forget you

813
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,360
I can't help but to forget you
