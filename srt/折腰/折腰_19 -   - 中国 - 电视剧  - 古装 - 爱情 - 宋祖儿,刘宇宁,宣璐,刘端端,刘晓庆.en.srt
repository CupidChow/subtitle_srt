=Episode 19=

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,860
Every time we go to the battle,

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,860
we leave them at home.

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,780
We weren't born on the same day,

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,420
and I guess

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,700
we won't die on the same day either.

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,340
But one day,

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,340
even if all four of us are gone,

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,300
burying these miniature weapons together

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,700
will mean we'll always be brothers.

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,140
So,

40
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,380
I want you to have this.

41
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
This...

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,380
Why are you giving it to me?

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,820
This is my most treasured thing.

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,100
I just want to give it to you.

45
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,140
Well...

46
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,300
Why do you want to give it to me?

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Just keep it for me.

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,820
Seeing it

49
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,860
will be like seeing me.

50
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,420
I don't want to see you at all.

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,380
What's going on?

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,580
- What's wrong?
- Let's talk.

53
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,860
- Wait.
- Let's have a talk.

54
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
What are you doing?

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,140
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

56
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,300
Let go of me. What are you doing?

57
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Stand there.

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,420
What is this about?

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,300
Someone claims

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,540
they have blood feuds with Yanzhou

61
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,580
and the feud will remain,

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,580
but look what happened.

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,020
They say they're devoted to the Lord

64
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,700
and have no intention of marrying.

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,540
Look what happened.

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
Someone...

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,580
Alright.

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,540
Enough about it.

69
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,580
It's my fault

70
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,860
for not telling you.

71
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,220
I'll accept whatever you want

72
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,060
to do to me.

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,580
If you ask me...

74
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,620
I'm not asking you.

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,900
How about this?

76
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,860
I'll give you all my possessions

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
and salary.

78
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
What do you think?

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,940
What are you saying?

80
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,180
We've been through life

81
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,380
and death together.

82
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,940
How can I have your salary?

83
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Besides, who wants your minimum salary?

84
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,380
Give me your little gold dart.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,580
Let me keep it for you.

86
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,420
Fine, fine.

87
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,740
Xiaotao and I...

88
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,580
Who said

89
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,260
they'd never marry a Qiao?

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,400
She's not a Qiao.

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,380
You said you wouldn't marry
a girl from Yanzhou.

92
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,260
I...

93
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,180
The Lord married the Lady.

94
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,180
That's different!

95
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,700
How dare you mention the Lord?

96
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,820
He brought his bride back to Yujun,

97
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,960
but you'd be marrying into Kangjun.

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,810
Not the same at all.

99
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,690
- Come on.
- It's...

100
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,260
You're going to marry into her family?

101
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,280
Throw him into the river.

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,380
- Throw him.
- What? No, no.

103
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,180
- Careful.
- Throw him into the river.

104
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,340
My Lord.

105
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,540
My Lady.

106
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,700
Isn't it the gift

107
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,260
I gave to Wei Liang?

108
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Why do you have it?

109
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,380
No.

110
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,820
You're mistaken.

111
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,480
- It's in your hand...
- My Lord.

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,620
Let's go, or the market will close.

113
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,500
So, you already knew

114
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,940
that Wei Liang liked Xiaotao.

115
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,940
Only slightly earlier than you.

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,620
No wonder

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,380
he refused to marry

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
Yuan Wang's daughter.

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,140
What do you think?

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,180
Think about what?

121
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,620
If Wei Liang

122
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,740
wants to marry Xiaotao,

123
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,260
would you agree?

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,260
She's from my family, after all.

125
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,020
Why wouldn't I agree?

126
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,500
No matter where she's from,

127
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,600
once she marries a Wei,

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,700
she's part of the Wei Clan.

129
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,340
You too.

130
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
My Lord...

131
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,900
What's wrong?

132
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,520
Did I say something wrong?

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,260
We used to doubt each other,

134
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,820
but now,

135
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,500
you're helping me with the canal.

136
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,300
What's wrong?

137
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,020
(Cake)
Why are you walking so fast?

138
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,180
My mother said all girls love sweets.

139
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
Perfect for the Lady.

140
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,900

142
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,820
The Lady knew how to read at three

143
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,940
and recited poems at five.

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,420

What kind of jewelry
would you like today?

150
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,060
You might not know,

151
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,300
but we have a full range here.

152
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,180
A jade hairpin,

153
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,620
a pearl jingling hairpin,

154
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,300
and a feather-inlaid hairpin.

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,180
I'm sure the Lady

156
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,060
will like them.

157
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,580
Do you like these things?

158
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,740
What girl doesn't like jewelry?

159
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,740
How about this one and this one?

160
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,580
Do you like them?

161
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,500
So, you do know what I like.

162
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,060
I don't know anything about this.

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,620
These were picked out

164
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,820
by Wei Qu.

165
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,500
I thought you weren't so shallow.

166
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
My Lady, why are you back so soon?

167
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
Did the Lord upset you again?

168
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,980
Tao, listen to me.

169
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,540
Don't talk to the Wei men anymore.

170
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,980
Well...

171
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,860
What do you mean?

172
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,140
All they can do is fight.

173
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,500
They're not romantic at all.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,740
That's true.

175
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,100
Wei Liang gave you this?

176
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,620
Look.

177
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,540
They have the same gift-giving habits.

178
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,380
War horses and darts.

179
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,500
It's different.

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
Wei Liang said

181
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,660
this is as precious to him as his life.

182
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,620
That's why he gave it to me.

183
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,860
How thoughtful.

184
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,260
Careful, My Lady.

185
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Don't drop it.

186
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,020
How could I dare drop his gift to you?

187
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
You keep it.

188
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
It's not that.

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,460
This was a gift from the Lord,

190
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,540
so we can't drop it.

191
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,460
The Lord?

192
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Wei Liang said

193
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,020
the four of them

194
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,860
each have a little weapon.

195
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,500
Wei Qu has a pair
of short and long swords.

196
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,860
Wei Xiao has a little gold bow.

197
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,780
Wei Duo has a little saber.

198
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,460
The Lord

199
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,020
especially had them made

200
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,380
based on their preferences.

201
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,500
So, the Wei men know how to give gifts,

202
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,020
and the Lord is no exception.

203
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
He just doesn't know how to give me one.

204
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,740
It's my fault then?

205
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,740
The Lord...

206
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
My Lord.

207
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,140
You didn't even wait for me.
Why walk so fast?

208
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,200
Here.

209
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,740
You've been in the army for years,

210
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,100
so you always walk fast.

211
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,380
I have to walk faster to keep up.

212
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,740
That's not necessary.

213
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,740
You picked out all the presents.

214
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,980
I've brought them back for you.

215
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,860
They're just local gifts

216
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,260
for Grandmother and Mother.

217
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,260
Still, thank you, My Lord.

218
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,620
These are for Grandmother and Mother?

219
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,380
I thought they were for you.

220
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
I don't need them.

221
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,620
I have those 500 war horses, right?

222
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,460
I knew

223
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,380
you'd like the war horses too.

224
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
We'll return to Yujun early tomorrow.

225
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,560
Take some time to rest.

226
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,820
There are still a few things
to wrap up about the canal.

227
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,860
I'll go to work.

228
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,220
Since you say these

229
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,860
are all for Grandmother and Mother,

230
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,780
then consider it

231
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,940
something I picked for you.

232
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,220
It's better than war horses.

233
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,020
See?

234
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,860
He still

235
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,220
learned something.

236
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,140
I just need to try a little harder.

237
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,260
But we're leaving

238
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,380
for Yujun tomorrow.

239
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,460
What? You don't want to go back?

240
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,860
It's not that.

241
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,460
I just don't want to waste my efforts.

242
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,500
Go bring Yang Feng to me.

243
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,820
Yes.

244
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,100
(Boya, Yanzhou, General's Mansion)

245
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,820
Fan.

246
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,740
What do you want?

247
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Nothing.

248
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm just used to snacking on sour plums

249
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,860
when I do needlework.

250
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
It's nothing.

251
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
My Lord.

252
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,140
How improper.

253
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm not even going to bother with you.

254
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,580
My Lord,

255
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,780
the Lady will be ready shortly.

256
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,100
How troublesome.

257
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,140
Generals.

258
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Thank you for this.

259
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
It's my duty.

260
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,550
- He's still unreliable.
- As for the canal,

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,990
- It's been years.
- I do have some experience.

262
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,620
Look at how ingratiating he is.

263
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,780
You two,

264
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,980
enough already.

265
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,340
It's as if he'd get promoted.

266
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,460
Wei Liang.

267
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,690
- Come.
- My Lord.

268
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,220
Let me ask you.

269
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,220
Why did you give away

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,780
the little gold dart from me?

271
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,020
My Lord.

272
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,660
You refused Yuan Wang's daughter

273
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,220
because you like Xiaotao.

274
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,740
Why didn't you tell me?

275
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
I was afraid you wouldn't approve.

276
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,460
But you still like her even so?

277
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,780
I couldn't help it.

278
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,780
Five years ago,

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,620
when we retook Yunzhong,

280
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,940
you stayed still
even the when fire burned your back

281
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,660
just to stay hidden.

282
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,740
And now you can't help it with this?

283
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,140
It's true.

284
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
Every time I'm working in the office,

285
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,140
I can't stop thinking about her.

286
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,420
Whenever there's something
delicious or interesting,

287
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,340
she's the first one who comes to mind.

288
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,100
When she's upset,

289
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,620
I lose sleep for nights.

290
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,860
When she's happy, I'm happy.

291
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,140
When she's sad, I'm sad too.

292
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,220
I just can't help it.

293
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,620
They say

294
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,660
even heroes fall for belles.

295
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,500
You're no exception too.

296
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,020
My Lord,

297
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,540
feelings are complicated.

298
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,900
You've never been in love,

299
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,220
so you don't understand.

300
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,740
My Lord,

301
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,380
what do you mean by "too"?

302
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,460
Right.

303
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,660
You're right. I don't understand.

304
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,860
Good thing we haven't left yet.

305
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,160
The prefect is right over there.

306
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,100
I'll go tell him now

307
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,260
I approve of the marriage.

308
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,140
Stay and get married.

309
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,260
No, no. My Lord.

310
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,020
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

311
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,740
My Lord.

312
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,700
My Lord.

313
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,740
Since you're ready,

314
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,780
let's depart then.

315
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,460
Everyone,

316
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,620
I'll leave the Yongning Canal

317
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,660
to your care.

318
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,020
We'll do our best.

319
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,980
Let's go.

320
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
This is bad.

321
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,740
Very bad.

322
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,740
Tell me. What happened?

323
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,910
What's wrong?

324
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,020
I have a copy of The Waterway Classic,

325
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,140
which records rivers and tributaries.

326
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,260
I should've brought it
to help with the canal.

327
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
But

328
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,860
my useless brain...

329
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,990
I completely forgot.

330
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,100
Forgot?

331
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,020
How could you forget?

332
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,500
It's a miracle you even remembered

333
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,780
to bring yourself.

334
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,260
I shouldn't have troubled you, My Lord,

335
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,100
but this book

336
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,300
concerns our schedule.

337
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,700
So, I must ask you

338
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,500
to fetch it for me.

339
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,940
You're so phony.

340
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,420
If you truly wanted to help
with our canal,

341
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,940
how could you forget it?

342
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,820
Shut up.

343
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,020
Do you truly care?

344
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,100
My Lord.

345
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,380
It's fine.

346
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,980
It's not a big deal.

347
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,740
I'll send someone

348
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,420
to Panyi to retrieve the book for you.

349
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,780
Why not

350
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,220
go with us?

351
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,740
That would be ideal.

352
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,300
If you can handle it personally,

353
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,740
that'll be perfect.

354
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,580
Hold on.

355
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,740
Are you sending the Lord of Wei

356
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,900
all the way to Panyi

357
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,180
just to fetch a book?

358
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,500
Lord Zhen, don't rush.

359
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,900
On the way to Panyi,

360
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,740
we'll follow the waterway.

361
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,500
We can check progress

362
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,020
on the later phase of the canal

363
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,980
and also revisit old places.

364
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,300
Besides, we can retrieve the book.

365
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,020
That's a triple win.

366
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,740
Just as the Lady said,

367
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,460
that's why I dared ask you to go.

368
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,060
My Lord, what do you think?

369
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,660
Last time,

370
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,020
we did a lot in Panyi.

371
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,660
I'd like to go back too.

372
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
Alright.

373
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,660
Let's do as the Lady says.

374
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,740
Let's go to Panyi.

375
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,740
Thank you, My Lord.

376
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,900
Let's go.

377
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,740
You get in the carriage first.

378
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,060
Did you see that, My Lady?

379
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,540
Just now, the Lord was staring at you

380
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,940
as if he was captivated.

381
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,060
(Boya, Yanzhou)

382
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,020
(General's Mansion)

383
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,900
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

384
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,780
My Lady.

385
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,020
My Lady.

386
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Bi Zhi.

387
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,300
Bi Zhi.

388
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,260
Can you hear me?

389
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,220
Xing, fetch the physician.

390
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,060
Yes.

391
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
Were you picking sour plums for me?

392
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,780
Two days ago, the general asked

393
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,300
where sour plums grow.

394
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,740
I told him

395
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,780
Mount Bang.

396
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,460
But he collapsed at the city gate.

397
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,020
Maybe he fell and got hurt

398
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,940
while picking.

399
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,740
This is a blade wound.

400
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,260
It must've been Xue Tai.

401
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,260
Mount Bang is near Boya's border.

402
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,300
Xue Tai often patrols there.

403
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,020
We'll ask the general once he wakes up.

404
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,180
Hurry, carry him inside.

405
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,140
Yes, hurry.

406
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,460
(General's Mansion)

407
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,780
You're awake.

408
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,180
Fan.

409
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
Don't move.

410
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,780
Fan, I want to sit up.

411
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Does the wound still hurt?

412
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,340
Were the sour plums

413
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
good?

414
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,260
It's fine if they weren't.

415
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,980
Next time,

416
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,940
I'll find another tree

417
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,260
and pick more for you.

418
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,700
I haven't eaten them yet.

419
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,020
Then try one.

420
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,020
Try it.

421
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
Is it...?

422
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,340
Is it not good?

423
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
If so,

424
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,420
don't eat them.

425
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,700
It's good.

426
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,580
It's very good.

427
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,660
I don't want sour plums anymore.

428
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,940
I just want a peaceful life with you.

429
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,860
Fan,

430
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,820
aren't we already living that way?

431
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,220
This

432
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,540
was just an accident.

433
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,300
I promise

434
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
I'll be careful next time.

435
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,180
Xue Tai won't catch me again.

436
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,540
If you were just a common man,

437
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,200
you wouldn't need to worry
about Xue Tai.

438
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,460
But you're the Commander of Boya Forces.

439
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,470
That's why

440
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,660
it's so dangerous.

441
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,740
Let's leave, Bi Zhi.

442
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,900
Fan,

443
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,260
I never wanted to be the commander.

444
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,700
I only wanted to give you

445
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,740
a stable home and a happy life

446
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,940
in this chaotic world.

447
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,980
Other people's lands

448
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,420
will never be as safe as our own.

449
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
And

450
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,740
more importantly,

451
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,220
I want the Lady

452
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,580
and your family's

453
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,100
approval.

454
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,700
I think you'll truly be happy that way.

455
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
Alright.

456
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,020
If trouble keeps coming,

457
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,780
then we'll make them too scared to try.

458
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,780
If we can win over

459
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,260
the Qiaos and Weis

460
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,050
and let all know you're my husband

461
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,560
and the Lord of Wei's cousin-in-law,

462
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,020
they wouldn't dare act again.

463
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
Alright.

464
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,820
No more tears.

465
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,180
My Lord.

466
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,580
You don't need to do this every time.

467
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm used to eating and sleeping
with the soldiers.

468
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,100
I just wanted to share it with you.

469
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,420
But this is coarse food.

470
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,900
Do you want this?

471
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
My Lord,

472
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,100
the road ahead is blocked.

473
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,020
What should we do?

474
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,220
I'll go check.

475
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,580
You eat first.

476
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,260
It's cold here.

477
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,220
Get in the carriage.

478
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,340
Xiaotao, help the Lady in.

479
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,120
Since you like this pancake,

480
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,340
have more.

481
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,540
Go back to your job.

482
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,430
Sure. Let's go.

483
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,140
Tao,

484
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,580
take the pancake.

485
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,540
Eat it first.

486
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
No need to wait for me.

487
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,900
Who's waiting for you?

488
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,940
Why did you give me this anyway?

489
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,740
The Lord said you wanted it.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,850
Oh, please.

491
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,260
What can you learn from him?

492
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,260
How clueless.

493
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,580
What did I do now?

494
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,980
How did I upset you this time?

495
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,700
You didn't upset me.

496
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,180
You offended the Lady, didn't you know?

497
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,180
Can't you tell?

498
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,500
It's obvious.

499
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,100
The Lady wants to get closer
to the Lord.

500
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,180
Can't you decide to change the route?

501
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,260
Did you have to call the Lord away?

502
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,540
I don't care.

503
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,900
You caused this mess.

504
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,220
You deal with it.

505
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,180
Fine.

506
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,660
I'll take care of it.

507
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,740
It's on you.

508
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,780
Bye.

509
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,100
Come back.

510
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,260
It's on you.

511
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,900
Not on us.

512
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,740
You promised her.

513
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,780
You figure it out.

514
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,620
Let's go.

515
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,780
Come back.

516
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,980
The Lord is slow-witted.

517
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,740
What are you thinking to expect him

518
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,060
to read the Lady's mind?

519
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Are you even a brother?

520
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,740
Are we brothers?

521
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,220
Didn't we say we share

522
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,500
blessings and hardships?

523
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,580
And now you chicken out
over a small problem?

524
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,700
It's not life or death.

525
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,060
You can handle this.

526
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,900
Let's go.

527
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,860
Come back.

528
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,780
One month's salary.

529
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,820
Fine, three months.

530
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,220
Kids

531
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,420
are not up for this.

532
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,020
Take him to play over there.

533
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,620
Don't move.

534
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,580
Come here.

535
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,780
Let's go.

536
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,320
What bad idea that I can't hear

537
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
are you cooking up now?

538
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,780
Back when I frequented taverns,

539
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,900
there were always tavern maids

540
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,100
fighting over me.

541
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,820
Now the Lady and the Lord

542
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,340
need someone like that.

543
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,980
You'll go

544
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,540
and make the Lord jealous?

545
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,660
Do you want me dead?

546
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,820
What's your point?

547
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,740
Listen carefully.

548
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,060
We need to be cruel now.

549
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,420
The best way to make someone

550
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,540
realize their feelings

551
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,980
is to make them feel loss first.

552
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,100
Think about it.

553
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,780
If Xiaotao suddenly went missing,

554
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,980
how would you feel?

555
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,740
Worried, heartbroken, and upset.

556
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,300
What a love expert.

557
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,660
Does the Lord have any orders?

558
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,260
The Lord told me to ask you

559
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,220
to wait here.

560
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,820
We'll guard you here.

561
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,780
Please.

562
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,500
Stay and guard here.

563
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,540
Guard here.

564
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,540
Wait here.

565
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,980
My Lord.

566
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,940
My Lord!

567
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
The Lady...

568
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,220
The Lady...

569
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,160
What's wrong with her?

570
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,340
She said she'd been sitting too long

571
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,260
in the carriage,

572
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,100
feeling suffocated.

573
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,600
She insisted on going out for a walk.

574
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,260
Does she have guards?

575
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,540
Wei Liang and Wei Duo are there.

576
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,820
Then it's fine.

577
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,910
But she hasn't come back even now.

578
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,580
She probably felt stifled
in the carriage

579
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,940
and went out to relax.

580
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,060
This march is dull.

581
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,740
Now that Wei Dian is gone,

582
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,780
her burden's lifted.

583
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,200
Let her enjoy herself a bit.

584
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,700
Why are you back?

585
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,660
- What's up?
- Why aren't you with the Lady?

586
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,780
My Lord,

587
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,620
the Lady wanted to fetch some water

588
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,580
and sent me back to ask

589
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,260
whether to fetch creek water or dew.

590
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,660
Are you out of your mind?

591
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,940
This is the wilds.

592
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,700
How could you leave the Lady alone?

593
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,780
- Wei Duo...
- Wei Duo?

594
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,260
Wei Duo is not even as capable as Tao.

595
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
How can you count on him?

596
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,220
This is the wilds with complex terrain.

597
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,260
Wild beasts could appear.

598
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
You're sending the Lady
to the tiger's den!

599
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,980
Even if we ignore that,

600
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,660
what if bandits want her for her looks?

601
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,070
What if refugees starving

602
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,940
from war

603
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,020
treat her like food?

604
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,780
Haven't you heard these stories?

605
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,740
If anything happens to the Lady,

606
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
you owe your life in apology.

607
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,900
My Lord, I'll teach him a lesson.

608
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,020
My Lord.

609
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,420
What's going on with you today?

610
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,060
She just went for a walk.

611
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,260
Isn't Wei Duo with her?

612
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,780
But it's been so long.

613
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,900
The Lady...

614
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,060
Fine.

615
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,660
I'll go find her.

616
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,020
My Lord, please.

617
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,740
You made it too terrifying just now.

618
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,780
If I hadn't, would the Lord be worried?

619
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,220
But you can't just jump
to the worst case.

620
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,580
She won't really go missing.

621
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,180
Wei Duo's with her, after all.

622
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,260
That's true.

623
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
What are you two whispering about?

624
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,360
- Wei Duo.
- Wei Duo.

625
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,500
Where's the Lady?

626
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,300
Where is she?

627
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,580
The Lady?

628
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,420
Isn't she with you?

629
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,260
Oh no, you didn't clean your ears.

630
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,420
Wei Duo.

631
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,900
Yes.

632
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,100
Where's the Lady?

633
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,100
Oh, my god.

634
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Where's the Lady?

635
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,740
Go look for her!

636
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,900
Over here!

637
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
Hyah!

638
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,160
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

639
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,460
Take them down.

640
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,300
Yes.

641
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,900
Come here.

642
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,780
Spare me, General.

643
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,940
Spare me, General.

644
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,500
Xiaotao, are you okay?

645
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,980
Who are you trying to take down?

646
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,020
- What's wrong?
- Xiaotao?

647
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,260
I'm fine.

648
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,900
Do something useful.

649
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,780
Take these people

650
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,980
to see the physician.

651
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,180
Some are sick.

652
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,100
How did you know I was here?

653
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,660
Are you okay?

654
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,580
What could happen to me?

655
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,100
I saw these refugees

656
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,980
lost in the woods.

657
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,260
They got separated

658
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,540
from their countrymen

659
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,460
while looking for food.

660
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,700
It was getting dark,

661
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,180
so I had the guards help us

662
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,220
find the way here.

663
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,420
They didn't abduct you?

664
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,060
No.

665
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,740
Go.

666
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,180
Let's go.

667
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,100
Wei Qu.

668
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,780
Where are you from?

669
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,500
Where are you headed?

670
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,740
General,

671
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,540
we came from Yenzhou.

672
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,980
This year's rain

673
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,180
was less than usual,

674
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,820
so Yenzhou and Yaozhou

675
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,660
fought over water

676
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,500
constantly.

677
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,740
Hundreds in our village
were forced to flee.

678
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,460
Only these few

679
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,020
made it this far.

680
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,100
General.

681
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,340
Here.

682
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,140
(From Yenzhou)

683
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,020
Yenzhou is over a thousand li away.

684
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Did you walk all the way?

685
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,020
We had no choice.

686
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,540
We went to Liangya,

687
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,580
but they wouldn't take us in.

688
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,420
Then we tried Yanzhou.

689
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,980
They wouldn't take us either.

690
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,980
Yes, General.

691
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,140
We're exhausted,

692
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,660
so we just wanted

693
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,860
to find a safe place here

694
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,460
to build huts through the winter.

695
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,380
When spring comes, we'll move on.

696
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Please, General, be merciful.

697
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,020
Don't drive us away.

698
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,820
Yes. Please don't drive us away.

699
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,300
We're not trying to expel you.

700
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,980
But the soil here

701
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,820
isn't good for building houses.

702
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,300
Where should we go then?

703
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,620
Please, General.

704
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,500
General.

705
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,420
- Help us.
- Please, General.

706
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,380
General, please help us.

707
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,060
- Please help us.
- Please, General.

708
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,980
Please help us.

709
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,140
General, please help us.

710
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,500
There's a place 20 li north,

711
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,790
bordering Panyi to the north
and Xindu to the east.

712
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,900
The soil there is good for building.

713
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,420
Besides,

714
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,940
it's close to the Yongning Canal.

715
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,060
Water is accessible.

716
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,380
You can clear the land, farm,

717
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
and make a living there.

718
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,660
If you promise that starting today,

719
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,020
you'll obey the law of Wei

720
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,200
and won't harm the people,

721
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,820
Wei will take you in.

722
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,500
You can drink Wei's water

723
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,660
and eat Wei's rice

724
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,220
just like ordinary citizens.

725
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,580
Thank you, General.

726
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,300
Thank you.

727
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,380
But

728
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,300
when we passed Panyi,

729
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
the mayor was away on business.

730
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,460
Without his approval,

731
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,500
we dared not stay outside the city.

732
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,500
Settling down there

733
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,140
won't be easy.

734
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,020
You're not dealing

735
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,940
with an ordinary general

736
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,140
but the Lord of Wei.

737
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,940
My Lord.

738
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,020
Thank the Lord.

739
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,420
Thank you, My Lord.

740
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,380
Thank you, My Lord, My Lady.

741
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,620
Thank you, My Lady, My Lord.

742
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,820
Thank you, My Lord.

743
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,500
- Get up now.
- Thanks, My Lady.

744
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,220
Come back to camp with us

745
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,020
for shelter and food.

746
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,580
We'll head to Panyi tomorrow morning.

747
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,220
Thank you, My Lady.

748
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,340
Thank you, My Lady, My Lord.

749
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,700
Thank you, My Lord.

750
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,180
Great.

751
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,700
The wandering days are over.

752
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,500
(Wei)

753
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,060
Where are you going?

754
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,100
There's no water left.

755
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,500
I'll get some water.

756
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
No need.

757
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,970
- Guards.
- Yes.

758
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,890
- Bring water.
- Yes.

759
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
Drink up.

760
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,100
Where are you going?

761
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,900
It's cold at night.

762
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,700
I'll get more clothes from the carriage.

763
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,620
No need.

764
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,580
Cover yourself with this.

765
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,420
You need it.

766
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,700
It's okay. Just cover yourself.

767
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,600
Here, cover yourself.

768
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,140
Come on.

769
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,170
- I need to change.
- No.

770
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,660
Sit down.

771
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,860
What's wrong today?

772
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,220
You're opposing me everywhere.

773
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,820
I don't care. I'm changing now.

774
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,660
No.

775
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,780
I'm telling you.

776
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,220
Starting today,

777
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,060
you must tell me where you're going.

778
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,060
You can't make us worry
like today anymore.

779
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,100
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

780
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,460
Chunniang did worry about me.

781
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,020
She nagged me a lot.

782
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,660
The one who worried most about you today

783
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,740
is not Chunniang.

784
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,780
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

785
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,820
Good.

786
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,020
Very good.

787
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,900
This one.

788
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,140
(Yao Ying'e, eldest daughter)
She's pretty,

789
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,660
but she's too old

790
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,980
to be offered to the Lords.

791
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,220
Yes.

792
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,780
(Li Su, eldest daughter)
She can sing and dance,

793
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,140
but she's famously awkward with words.

794
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Yes, yes.

795
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,460
My Lord.

796
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,300
What do you think
of Lord Xu's second daughter?

797
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,960
(Xu Fanjing)
She has peachy cheeks

798
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,390
and a captivating smile.

799
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,900
Also, Lyu's youngest daughter

800
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,820
is skilled in four arts
and is well-known.

801
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,220
If we can find her,

802
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,300
(Lyu Xiaojun)
she'll be a great gift.

803
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,420
Finding her

804
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,180
won't be easy.

805
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,340
It might be too wasteful.

806
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,500
My Lord,

807
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,380
this is for the good of the realm.

808
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,100
Besides, you have no children.

809
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,420
What's wrong
with having a marriageable woman

810
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,940
as your concubine?

811
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,580
Concubine?

812
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,220
Yue,

813
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,900
how can you order

814
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,220
a search for belles everywhere

815
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,460
to be your concubines?

816
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,020
What are you saying?

817
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,140
I'm no young man anymore.

818
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,980
I...

819
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,660
I just want to find some young girls,

820
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,580
nurture them,

821
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,300
and marry them to the Lords.

822
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,620
You've benefited from marrying off

823
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,300
two girls, haven't you?

824
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
I'm thinking for the whole realm.

825
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,500
When Lord Qiao Gui was alive,

826
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,180
he never had this idea.

827
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,940
You're just a woman; be quiet.

828
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,860
You...

829
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,620
Lady Ding.

830
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
Yue,

831
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,900
you've gone too far this time.

832
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,460
Ci and Manman's birth mother
passed away early.

833
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,340
These years,

834
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,980
it's Lady Ding who's been
managing the household

835
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,820
and raising these three children.

836
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,900
Even Father

837
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,540
respects her deeply.

838
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,100
How can you scold her this way?

839
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,300
I already said.

840
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
This is not about concubines.

841
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,980
I didn't say it.

842
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,900
It's him.

843
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,380
It's him who said it.

844
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,420
Ping,

845
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,620
I'm doing this for our family

846
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,460
and for Yanzhou.

847
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,400
Since Manman married into Wei,

848
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,160
our relationship has clearly improved.

849
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,500
Clearly, marriage alliances work.

850
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,300
Ping,

851
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,780
right now,

852
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,220
Liangya, Juejun, and other states

853
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,500
are expanding their armies.

854
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,540
The world is on the brink of chaos.

855
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,700
I wish our family

856
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,820
had more daughters to marry off.

857
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,220
Uncle, aren't you afraid

858
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,620
you'll be laughed at for doing this?

859
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,620
If Yanzhou uses girls to curry favor,

860
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,020
it's a disgrace to men.

861
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,620
If that's really done,

862
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,940
how can I face anyone

863
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,460
as the future Governor of Yanzhou?

864
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,140
- Ci.
- Yue.

865
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,020
How can you be so confused?

866
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
You must be misled by him.

867
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,020
- Ping.
- I'll expel you right now.

868
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,140
My Lord, this...

869
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,140
Ci.

870
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,940
Mr. Zhang is our aide.

871
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,020
You'll need him in the future.

872
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,340
Does he deserve that?

873
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,040
My Lord,

874
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,220
since Young Master Ci doesn't trust me,

875
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,180
I'll pack up

876
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,500
and retire.

877
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,560
You don't have to leave.

878
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,660
I'm going now to pack

879
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,020
and leave this filthy place.

880
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,180
What nonsense is this?

881
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,540
Ci.

882
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,220
- My Lord, you...
- Enough, Mr. Zhang.

883
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,660
Don't make it worse.

884
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,660
I...
