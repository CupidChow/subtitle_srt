1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and your kindness

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and your kindness

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and your kindness

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and your kindness

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and your kindness

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your kindness

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your kindness

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and your kindness

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and your kindness

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and your kindness

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and your kindness

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and your kindness

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and your kindness

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and your kindness

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and your kindness

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your kindness

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and your kindness

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and your kindness

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I...

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's you.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Master.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How have you been?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You mean this man is him?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you know that he attacked my Yan State

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
several nights ago

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and I lost tens of thousands of soldiers?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have offended you before.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I wonder if you have the opportunity

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to redeem your mistake.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If we can cooperate,

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will regain my power

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and take back the seal of Yan State.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The seal?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am talented and intelligent.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am a man of great talent.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have been a good man

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and I have been a good man

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
for a long time.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now I have the military power

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and I have a son-in-law like Wei Shao.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are really a man of great talent

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
for the Yan State.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What do you mean?

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Wei Shao is the leader of Yan State.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He has nothing to do with Qiao Ping.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you are not satisfied,

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you can take the risk.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want to kill the Empress Wei?

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now Wei State has

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the communication of various states.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If it is too late,

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wei State must not wait.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There is no chance

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
if we don't make a plan now.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In recent months,

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have sent messages

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to withdraw troops and forces to defend Wei State.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have also made an appointment with the Han general Xue Tai

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
to split the army into two groups.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Everything is ready.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I just need to see

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the determination of the leader of Wei State.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are here to seduce me?

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am here

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to cooperate with the Central Committee

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to pacify Wei State

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and defeat them.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We have not

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
sat down

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and had a drink

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
like this late at night.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I propose a toast

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to you

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
in this opportunity.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I know my own way.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In recent years,

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have been

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
working hard on my own.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am very happy

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to have a meal

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
with you.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will drink this second cup

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to my heart's content.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Brother,

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you have killed me.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you were not so lenient,

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I would not be able to do

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
anything by myself.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will drink

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
only the first cup.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Good.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We are brothers.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We can work together.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Come on.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have something

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
to tell you.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Please go ahead.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have decided

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to lead Yan State

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
to kill

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Lord Liangya and Wei State.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wei State and Wei State are completely separated.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why?

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Brother, why?

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why did you say that?

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What do you mean?

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do I

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
have to fight for your permission

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to kill Wei State?

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I did not mean that.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now,

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the world is in a state of chaos

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and the people are in danger.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yan State

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
can still protect itself for now.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In my opinion,

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we should be more vigilant.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We should not surrender to Liangya.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother,

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the reason why

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the Qiao family and Wei family

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
are in a state of chaos

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
is that if one side is in a crisis

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and the other side should help them,

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
even if they do not help,

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
they should not be abandoned.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Speaking of which,

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you are just trying

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to tie Yan State

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and the life and death of the Qiao family

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
with that Wei State.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It is not right.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
At that time,

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the two families of Qiao and Wei were united.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Brother

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
was happy to see it.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now,

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the situation is getting worse.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother wants to break the contract.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Such a thing

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is not different

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
from the wall.

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How dare you talk to me like that?

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you still think of me as your brother?

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you want to know, I am the master of Yan State.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I have no son.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How can I do this

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
for my own sake?

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I am still thinking about

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the long-term of Yan State.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I tell you,

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I am not allowed to let you

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
know this.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are the guy

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
who killed Geng Li call Ilai to the farm.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are another person.

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,060
No need to go back to docs and

176
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,000
see whose 나뜰.

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The girl you fell into

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
가는

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
After you have entered the farm,

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
you will meet up in search of her again.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't be mad.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are not a prince.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have a job but you are televisible.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,700
You have a job but you are assigned to

185
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
The temporary daughter.

186
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Gao...

187
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
He's dead?

188
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
There's more?

189
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,900
What did you give him?

190
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,300
Why can't he see things?

191
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,100
I... I don't know.

192
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
Liu Shan gave him the poison.

193
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,300
But it's several times stronger than the normal one.

194
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
I think he was angry and attacked.

195
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
That's why he can't see things.

196
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,700
He'll be fine in a few days.

197
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I...

198
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Master, the priority is to control the army.

199
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,100
We need to get back the military power and re-establish the situation.

200
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,300
How's Si?

201
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
He can only be controlled, not hurt.

202
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,100
Don't worry, Master.

203
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,500
I've sent a team of capable people to keep a close watch on him.

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,660
The

205
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Look at this.

206
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Li.

207
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Li.

208
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,100
Madam,

209
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,300
a letter from Kang Jing.

210
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,700
Is it from Ci?

211
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,900
What did he say?

212
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,900
It's from Father.

213
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,100
Father said he heard that I had a son

214
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,500
and wanted to meet Li.

215
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,300
He wanted us to take him back to Princess Kang for a few days.

216
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
I heard that

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,900
the family was getting closer.

218
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
I think Father heard that he had a grandson.

219
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,500
He was happy.

220
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
So he forgot about what he said.

221
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,900
I hope so.

222
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,300
But Father does like children.

223
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
When we were young,

224
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
he treated us very well.

225
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
He's asleep.

226
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,100
I'll go find Qi Bi and Guai Wan.

227
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,900
We'll set off in a few days.

228
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,700
Be careful.

229
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Okay.

230
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,700
We're back in Tang.

231
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,500
They're here.

232
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,700
Fan, come.

233
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,700
Father.

234
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Father.

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I've been waiting for you.

236
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,300
Where are Mother, Uncle and Brother?

237
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
They're all waiting in the mansion.

238
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,900
I'll go and check.

239
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Okay.

240
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,300
I'll go and check.

241
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Okay.

242
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,500
I'll go and check.

243
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
I heard that you're very good to Fan.

244
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
You often give him sour plum.

245
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Yes.

246
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,300
I learned the recipe of sour plum from Chu Niang.

247
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
He likes it.

248
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,300
He Qiao,

249
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Kang Jun's plum is ripe.

250
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
It's in Xishan.

251
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
Go and pick some for him.

252
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,700
Let us taste it.

253
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,500
Okay.

254
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,700
Father, we just arrived.

255
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,900
Don't just make a fool of yourself

256
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,700
and do these silly things.

257
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Besides, when Mother was in Boya,

258
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,100
I didn't let her pick sour plum.

259
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,100
She's now also a electrons to reserved man.

260
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,700
Since she is the son-in-law of Qiao's,

261
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,300
she could act with a little filial piety.

262
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,900
I was a little confused

263
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,700
perché father was in a state of panic

264
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,500
over Wei Shaoqi.

265
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
We are real blood closest relatives.

266
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
I should treat straight.

267
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Your wedding

268
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,300
is worthy of rotation.

269
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Since you have a child, you should be fair.

270
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Father, I'll go back quickly.

271
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Okay, go back quickly.

272
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Li Zhi.

273
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

274
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Come back with me.

275
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Li Er is still in the car.

276
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
I'll come back later.

277
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Li Zhi, come back quickly.

278
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Father, you have to be careful.

279
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
What are you doing?

280
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Put her on the bridge.

281
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Let go. What are you doing?

282
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Li Zhi.

283
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Li Zhi.

284
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Li Zhi, if you don't stop,

285
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
she will be hurt.

286
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
You are Li Yan Manu, Li Zhi.

287
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
You are indeed as hard as Xue Tai said.

288
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
You are as hard as a stone.

289
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I'm more assured.

290
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
It must be very interesting for you to deal with Wei Shao.

291
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm not afraid of anything.

292
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
I, Meng Guoshi,

293
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
won't hurt Marquis Wei and the female army.

294
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Then she will be hurt.

295
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Stop.

296
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Kneel down.

297
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Kneel down.

298
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Kneel down.

299
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
From today onwards,

300
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Ma Henu,

301
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
you can only choose one identity to stay by my side

302
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
and let me go.

303
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Otherwise...

304
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Of course.

305
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
You can also try to see if you are faster

306
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
or my knife is faster.

307
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Stop.

308
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Who is going to enter the city?

309
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Wei Liang from Wei State

310
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
is here to ask for help from Marquis Wei.

311
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,300
General Wei, please wait.

312
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,300
General, Wei Liang is here.

313
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Please let him go.

314
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,300
General Wei, please.

315
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Hurry up.

316
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Hurry up.

317
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
Hurry up.

318
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Hurry up.

319
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Sir,

320
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
do you have a good Yanzhou orchid?

321
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
I have to go home to get it.

322
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
It's not expensive.

323
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Do you still want it?

324
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
The price doesn't matter.

325
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
I want the best.

326
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Okay, follow me.

327
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Move aside.

328
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Move aside.

329
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Hurry up.

330
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Sir,

331
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
is the army of Kang peaceful today?

332
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Thanks to the army,

333
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
the family is open and can sleep.

334
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Then why are there so many

335
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Xiong Luo soldiers on the street?

336
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I don't know.

337
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
There are indeed many soldiers on the street today.

338
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Let's go.

339
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Did they go out?

340
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
No, they aren't.

341
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Move to the side.

342
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
communicate with us.

343
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,300
have a big meal.

344
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,940
Bring the female army to production smoothly

345
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,700
Let them think about the joy of the sky

346
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,660
Come to ask the emperor

347
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,180
Manman produces

348
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
He is a big man

349
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,940
Can't help much

350
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,660
I can only cause chaos to the Marquis

351
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,460
How about this

352
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,100
Wait for Manman and her mother and children

353
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,140
I take Aci to visit together

354
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,940
You worry too much

355
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,380
How can this be called chaos?

356
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,700
Otherwise, ask the emperor to come out

357
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,260
How about asking him

358
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,900
My brother is not feeling well recently

359
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,660
I'm resting at home

360
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,980
Uncomfortable to see guests

361
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
The master is sick

362
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,380
Then I should go to visit

363
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
To show my filial piety

364
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,940
Otherwise, I will

365
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,580
He just took the medicine and fell asleep

366
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,060
I'll send someone to see if he's awake

367
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,500
Mr. Zhang

368
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,740
You go and see

369
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,340
Yes

370
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,700
Go

371
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,820
Let the servants do this kind of little thing

372
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,420
Why do you ask the master to do this kind of thing?

373
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,380
Zhang Pu is more considerate

374
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,780
Where is the little wolf king?

375
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,900
I haven't seen it for a long time

376
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I miss it very much

377
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,460
Aci went up the mountain to hunt

378
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,380
It's getting late

379
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,460
Haven't come back yet

380
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,380
He is young and playful

381
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,740
By the way, when I passed by the Boya

382
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,260
I heard that the general and his wife

383
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,740
Also invited to come to Kangjing

384
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
But I didn't bring the child

385
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,540
Can I go to visit

386
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,580
The general is going to ask my family

387
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,060
Can't be changed

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:10,580
retirement

390
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,660
In this way

391
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,560
But master

392
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,780
In this way

393
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,140
I psychologist

394
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,500
But I find that

395
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,300
I just forget

396
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Zhou Mu, do you want to steal dogs and keep them as a thief?

397
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Since the dog of Wei Shao is here,

398
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
how can I let you go back alive?

399
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Bi Zhi, you are a green-eyed thief.

400
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Do you still want to betray the red?

401
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Bi Zhi, why are you still not doing it?

402
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Do you not want your wife and son to be killed?

403
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,300
His wife is killed,

404
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
so she does not belong to my family.

405
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
This is becoming a big problem.

406
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Do you mean to say that

407
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300

411
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
I need to check the body.

412
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Do you want to search my body?

413
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
I don't dare. Hurry.

414
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Auntie.

415
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300

416
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Auntie.

417
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
What happened outside?

418
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
How is my father?

419
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Why did Uncle lock me up?

420
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Don't call him uncle anymore.

421
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
He is now in alliance with Liu Yan.

422
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
He is going to deal with your brother-in-law.

423
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Your father and your elder sister are all locked up.

424
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
The pen and paper are also under detention.

425
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
They have to work for them.

426
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
General Wei Liang suddenly went into the room.

427
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
They also stole it.

428
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Now they are still alive.

429
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Zi, the most important thing now is for you to escape.

430
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Save General Wei Liang so that he can inform your brother-in-law.

431
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Zhi.

432
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
Move.

433
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Young Master, don't be impulsive.

434
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Move back.

435
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Move back.

436
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Move back.

437
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Zi.

438
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Zi.

439
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
Don't you dare to move back.

440
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Zi has three good points.

441
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
How are you going to explain to the Ministry of State?

442
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Move back.

443
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
Zi.

444
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Move back.

445
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Zi.

446
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Young Master, don't be impulsive.

447
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Don't follow me.

448
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Mother.

449
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Take care.

450
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Hurry up and chase.

451
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Zi.

452
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
Zi.

453
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Are you okay, Yuchi?

454
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
Zi.

455
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Yuchi.

456
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Stop.

457
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Hurry up and chase.

458
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
Don't move.

459
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Stop.

460
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Don't run.

461
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Don't run.

462
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
purpose No.

463
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,960
Xiao Tao.

464
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Stop.

465
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,420
I am willing to take all the relation of Yuanα e in the world

466
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Starting today

467
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,820
I want to write the written application

468
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,780
for the Hanes

469
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,940
Fl participating in garden

470
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,020
I will stay with all shortage

471
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,140
Don't go to become the United States

472
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,400
for effort

473
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,940
I wish you good health

474
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,260
Come

475
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,600
I want to live well

476
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,160
I'm sorry.

477
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,160
ależy Pikely

478
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
What about A'ci?

479
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
She escaped. I sent someone to chase her.

480
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
She escaped?

481
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
You must not hurt her life.

482
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Lord.

483
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
If we keep this secret,

484
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm afraid we won't be able to hide it.

485
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Since we can't hide it, why don't we just start the war?

486
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Attack Pan Yi and beat him.

487
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
As long as we control the Yongning District,

488
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
it's like controlling the lives of all states.

489
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
That's right.

490
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Pan Yi has a lot of soldiers to guard.

491
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
It's not easy to get them.

492
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
That's right.

493
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
It depends on you, Lord Zhongwu.

494
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
See if you have a way to

495
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
open Pan Yi's gate.

496
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
This...

497
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
The Magistrate Yang Feng

498
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
was once my father's confidant.

499
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,600
He was a man of good character.

500
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I hope he won't stop me.

501
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Open the gate!

502
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Open the gate!

503
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Open the gate!

504
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Open the gate!

505
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
What happened, General?

506
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
General, look.

507
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
This is the enemy's base.

508
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
It's not good for us to keep it.

509
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm afraid we can't get out of here.

510
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
We can't get out of here.

511
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
General.

512
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
General.

513
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Open the gate!

514
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Open the gate!

515
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
General, look.

516
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Why did Yan Zhongmu

517
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
and the other generals

518
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
of the Boya Army

519
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
do this?

520
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
General, let me ask.

521
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Zhongmu!

522
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
You're leading the army to the death.

523
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
What's the purpose of this?

524
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Yang Feng, Liu Yan led the army to attack the Kang Army.

525
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
He saved me with his brush.

526
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Open the gate and let me go in.

527
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
I'll hide.

528
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Wait, Zhongmu.

529
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
General,

530
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Wei and Yan are allies.

531
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
They're allies.

532
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Please let my uncle go in

533
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
and send a message

534
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
to Yu Jun.

535
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Well...

536
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Thank you, General.

537
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Okay.

538
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Open the gate!

539
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Open the gate!

540
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Zhongmu!

541
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Get in the city!

542
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Open the gate!

543
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Open the gate!

544
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Open the gate!

545

Open the gate!

551
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Open the gate!

552
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Open the gate!

553
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Open the gate!

554
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Open the gate!

555
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Open the gate!

556
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Open the gate!

557
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Open the gate!

558
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Open the gate!

559
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Open the gate!

560
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600

General Bi...

564
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
General Bi Zhi, you...

565
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Yang Feng,

566
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I've allied with Liangya

567
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
to fight against Wei.

568
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
From now on,

569
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Pan Yi will return to Yanzhou.

570
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
You're a father and a father-in-law.

571
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
You're also a smart man.

572
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
You know

573
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
what to do, right?

574
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I know.

575
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Zhongmu,

576
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
you've been here so many times.

577
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
You didn't notice it?

578
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
Xindu...

579
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
How many people

580
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
can be Bi Zhi's opponents

581
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
in the world?

582
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Yes.

583
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You're really worth it.

584
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Bi Zhi,

585
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
he's not as good as you, Yuan Shun.

586
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
He's not as good as you, Yuan Shun.

587
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
He's not as good as you, Yuan Rong.

588
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
He's trying to stop you.

589
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
He's already dead.

590
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Zhongmu,

591
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Your Highness.

592
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Please inform

593
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
the county magistrate

594
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
that I have the key to Ning Qu.

595
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
The people should stand

596
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
and think about it.

597
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I understand.

598
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I understand.

599
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,820
shops

600
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
He's late.

601
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I should have known

602
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
that the Funeral

603
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I'll drink with you.

604
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Liu Yan is a traitor.

605
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
He's a man of great power.

606
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,080
If he gets Shuiyuan,

607
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,680
the world will be in chaos.

608
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
You want me to be his target?

609
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
No way!

610
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I told you to follow Lord Liangya.

611
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
But you didn't listen.

612
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Luckily, we're in a team.

613
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
After we succeed,

614
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
we can share a cup of soup.

615
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Wei is a big country.

616
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
I agreed to participate in the cultivation.

617
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
It's just a chance to win.

618
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,760
If Liangya can really defeat Wei,

619
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
it's a good thing.

620
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Let's see.

621
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Lord, you're being too filial.

622
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Lord, you're being too filial.

623
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Can you make it?

624
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Liu Yan is determined to kill us all.

625
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,840
We can't let Shuiyuan get involved.

626
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
Yes.

627
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Young Master.

628
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Shuiyuan is back.

629
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Young Master.

630
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
It's been a while since I've been away.

631
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
I should come back

632
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
to see you.

633
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
It's far away from me.

634
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I miss you.

635
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Shuiyuan asked for a horse

636
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
and a team.

637
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
But there's something wrong with the border.

638
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Am I hurt?

639
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
No.

640
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Then,

641
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
you want to help Yu Jun, right?

642
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Liu Yan is just a humble man.

643
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
I just need to help him.

644
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
I can solve the problem.

645
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Shuiyuan.

646
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,840
If I don't take advantage of the situation

647
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,840
and consider your concern

648
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
for the Wei family,

649
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,840
don't mention the rest.

650
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Zhou Mu.

651
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Guards.

652
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Yes.

653
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Please go back to your room.

654
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
You must be tired.

655
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,840
You should rest in your room.

656
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Young Master.

657
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Please.

658
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Yu Jun.

659
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
General Xue Tai is here.

660
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
General Xue.

661
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Yu Jun.

662
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Lord Liangya has announced to the world

663
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
that he has successfully taken over Pan Yi.

664
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Our plan has been successful.

665
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Good.

666
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
In that case,

667
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
it's time for Zhong Zhou Mu to come to see me.

668
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Zhong Zhou is thousands of miles away from Pan Yi.

669
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Even if he can borrow the horse,

670
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
it's hard to keep up.

671
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Who said I was going to attack Pan Yi?

672
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
You mean...

673
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Liu Yan took over Pan Yi and occupied Yongning District.

674
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Wei Shao must be in danger.

675
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
As long as he dares to go,

676
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I will take Yu Jun

677
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
and take Wei family.

678
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Yu Jun has such an idea.

679
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Lord Liangya is known to be a great man

680
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
for attacking Pan Yi.

681
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
But what I want

682
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
is more than just a son.

683
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
I want to step on the white bone of the Wei family.

684
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
The blood of the Wei family

685
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,840
is slowly coming to the bottom.

686
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,840
The weakness of the Wei family's muscle

687
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
is all I have.

688
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Who is it?

689
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
You are...

690
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
my brother-in-law.

691
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Mr. Qiao,

692
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
go report to the master.

693
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Zi.

694
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
You're awake.

695
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Sister.

696
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Brother-in-law.

697
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
I told Wei Liang

698
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
to go to you and ask for a check.

699
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Why did you come back alone?

700
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Xiao Tao.

701
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Xiao Tao.

702
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Wei Liang asked me

703
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
to give you Lan Cao.

704
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Wei Liang

705
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
was killed.

706
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Are you crazy?

707
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Are you crazy?

708
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You are thinking about it, right?

709
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Such a big man,

710
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you said he was dead and he died.

711
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You stayed here all night.

712
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You are so good.

713
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You opened your eyes and told me that Wei Liang was dead.

714
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Can you think about it?

715
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
He died with such a big army.

716
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Aren't you fine?

717
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Why didn't you die when he died?

718
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You can believe it.

719
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm going to wash my clothes.

720
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Zi.

721
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What do you mean?

722
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Tell me.

723
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Tell me!

724
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Wei Liang

725
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
was killed.

726
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
My father-in-law was instigated by Zhang Pu.

727
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He was going to join hands with Liu Yan

728
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
to fight against my brother-in-law.

729
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Zhang Pu also poisoned him.

730
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He poisoned my father's eyes.

731
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He also made me and my sister

732
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
fall in love with the same kind of people

733
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and forced us to be separated.

734
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I don't know why.

735
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But when Wei Liang came to the Kang Mansion

736
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
to see my father and me,

737
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Liu Yan was afraid that he would be defeated.

738
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So he ordered a fight.

739
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
I'm sorry.

740
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
We have no strength to resist.

741
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
General Wei Liang risked his life to protect me.

742
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
He was so angry.

743
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
He was so angry.

744
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I deserve to die.

745
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I deserve to die.

746
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Zi San, look at me.

747
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Wei Liang went to pick you up.

748
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Where is he?

749
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Look at me.

750
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Where is Wei Liang?

751
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
I'm not going.

752
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Tell me. Where is he?

753
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

754
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Wei Liang is dead!

755
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Where is he?

756
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
He deserves to die.

757
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Why didn't you die?

758
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Why didn't you kill him?

759
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Wei Xiao!

760
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Stop!

761
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Report!

762
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:52,380
Liu Yan led the army to take the

763
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
I'm sorry.

764
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm sorry.

765
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm sorry.

766
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
