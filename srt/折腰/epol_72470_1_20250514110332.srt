1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 1

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Grandfather, what kind of person is Wei Shao?

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You should ask his grandfather first.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When I was a man of Yan Zhe Mu,

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I held a labor conference.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In the name,

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I invited all the families to discuss the issue.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In the context,

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I wanted to make friends.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We are like old friends.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have no intention to repay the kindness of the Song family.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I am willing to let the Lu family be the witness.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will ally with Yan Zhe to form a alliance.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From now on,

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
whoever dares to invade Yan Zhe will be my enemy.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The two families of Qiao Wei,

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we are born and raised together.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We will fight together.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yan Zhe is still...

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
After several years,

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,460
I have been working with the

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yan Zhe army.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Fourteen years ago,

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yan Zhe sent the Han general Lu Si to invade Wei State.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have learned a lot.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to cut off this bloodline.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Uncle,

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the Qiao family hasn't come.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They are going to break the treaty.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Qiao Wei is dead.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
For a verbal treaty,

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you want to drag us into the battle?

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Father,

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
these years,

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we have given Wei State money and food.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We are worthy of your friendship with the Marquis Wei.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We have agreed to send troops to help.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now we withdraw the army.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Isn't this a personal intention?

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We can find a leader.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Father,

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you'd better make up your mind.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Today, I will use this gun to kill the enemy.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Everything is in God's hands.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All troops!

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Father!

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Father!

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't cry, son.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Son,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
remember,

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
don't trust anyone else.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The ancestral talisman was destroyed by the Qiao family.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's why it's so bad today.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the hope of the Wei family.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Promise me,

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
don't cry in the future.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Father!

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This city is the border.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a new city.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Drag them into the city.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Bury them with the battle.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The capital will be destroyed in three days.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes!

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The ancestral talisman

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
is not to let the people of Yan State

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
get involved in the battle.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's either to let them down

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
or to let the people down.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If it were me,

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know what to choose.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But now,

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wei Shao is in the middle of the war.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He wants to take back the capital from Li Su.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If we send troops to support Li Su now,

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
why would he do that?

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's not a good person.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's a good person.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's a good person.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's a good person.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's a good person.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If we send troops to Li Su,

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wei Shao may not win.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But if we don't support him,

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
he'll take down the capital

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and send troops to Yan State

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to attack Pan Yi.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What should we do then?

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's a doctor named Xu

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
in the old Wei family.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's quite far-sighted.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want to talk to him about this.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I want to talk to him about this.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My grandfather wanted to let Sister Zhang marry Wei Shao.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If we take this opportunity to get rid of the evil

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and get rid of the hatred,

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
it's indeed a good match.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But Wei Shao witnessed the three generations of ancestors

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
fighting each other.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Will he look at us with a grudge

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and look at us with a grudge?

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What kind of person is Wei Shao?

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The Legend of Xiao Mi

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Episode 9

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Throw it away.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, this way.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
Wait. Wait.

112
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I'll do it. I'll do it.

113
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Man Man.

114
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Man Man.

115
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Man Man.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,480
You are always distracted.

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Why can't you tell me what's on your mind?

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
What do you mean?

119
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Wei Shao has surrounded Xin Du for days.

120
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,280
I don't know how the battle is going.

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
You are not afraid at all.

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,880
Wei Shao is fighting against Xin Du, not me.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,280
Why should I be afraid?

124
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,880
Then he will fight against Pan Yi after he has beaten Xin Du.

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Really?

126
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,280
Yuzhi, turn around.

127
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Sister.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,080
If Yan State doesn't want to fight,

129
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,480
we can only get along.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Then

131
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,480
we can only marry you to Wei Shao.

132
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,280
Marry me to Wei Shao?

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
The prince of Liangya, Liu Yan,

134
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,880
covered his uncle's face.

135
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,680
He said that the prince of Liangya sent a marriage envoy

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,080
to marry you.

137
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
I was entrusted by the prince of Liangya

138
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
to marry you.

139
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,480
I heard that

140
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,680
it was a fake.

141
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,880
I don't know if it's true or not.

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Back then, the prince of Liangya

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,280
married Mrs. Ding.

144
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
Mrs. Ding was a maid of the palace.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,680
She used the sacred money of the red dress.

146
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,480
I wonder if the prince of Liangya

147
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,280
will marry the girl, Xiao Qiao.

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Dongmu,

149
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
are you willing to be my maid?

150
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Uncle.

151
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Your Highness,

152
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,480
if Wei Shao gets Xin Du,

153
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,080
Yan State will be involved.

154
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,880
You don't know that

155
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
my father has already

156
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,480
married Mrs. Xu, the daughter of Wei State.

157
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
He wants to marry my daughter, Xiao Qiao,

158
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,280
to Marquis Wei.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Marquis Wei is the son-in-law of our Qiao family.

160
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,680
If you allow my niece, Xiao Qiao,

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,280
to marry my daughter,

162
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,880
the prince and Marquis Wei are a couple.

163
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Why are you so modest?

164
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Uncle,

165
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
I was in trouble since childhood.

166
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm happy to have you two as my concubines.

167
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
My cousin and I

168
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,480
are childhood friends.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Look.

170
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Our prince

171
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,080
has been a kind and loyal person since childhood.

172
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
In that case,

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
let's

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,080
get married today.

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
That's right.

176
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,680
We can set a wedding date

177
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
to fulfill the marriage of this couple.

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Come on.

179
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
To you.

180
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,280
The royal family of Liangya

181
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
will give a speech for the prince.

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,480
The bride will be given a gift.

183
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
The gift will be a big banquet.

184
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
The money will be one million.

185
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,760
The wedding will be

186
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,480
a bottle of wine,

187
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
a bottle of rice,

188
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,880
and a bottle of rice.

189
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
Two sheepskin sheets

190
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
and a snake's tail.

191
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
This is snake's tail?

192
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Why does it look like a rat's tail?

193
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
It's a rat's tail.

194
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,680
You may not know that

195
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,280
it's hard to find snake's tail now.

196
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,480
Besides, we've been walking here all the way.

197
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
We still have time to get it.

198
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Besides,

199
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,680
the common people use snake's tail.

200
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
Isn't it rat's tail?

201
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,880
We're not common people.

202
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,480
How is it, Uncle?

203
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,680
It's good enough that we can give them rat's tail.

204
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
There's no need to give them so much.

205
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Manman.

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,080
If Liu Yanruo really treats you well,

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
you don't have to mind these false rumors.

208
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Besides, you two still have

209
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,280
a small relationship.

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
Unlike you,

211
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm going to marry the King of Tiger soon.

212
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
Brothers.

213
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,080
Are you going to eat or not?

214
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
We can't eat even if we're hungry.

215
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Hurry up.

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Hurry up.

217
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Come on.

218
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,480
Three or six.

219
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,080
Master.

220
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,680
We haven't fought for a day.

221
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,080
We're all upset.

222
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,280
The new capital is right in front of us.

223
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
If we rush there, we'll be in trouble.

224
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
We're afraid we can't win.

225
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
The new capital is not as good as the city.

226
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
The central plains are low.

227
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,080
It's a long year of drought.

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
The food supply in Lisu is definitely not enough.

229
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,480
This city can't be broken.

230
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Why are you in a hurry?

231
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,480
What are you doing?

232
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
They're looking for food.

233
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
I told them

234
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,480
we not only have food,

235
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,680
but also meat.

236
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Master.

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Master.

238
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,480
Master.

239
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Master.

240
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,680
Madam Tai sent a letter.

241
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,280
What did grandmother do?

242
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Madam Tai

243
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
is writing a personal letter to you.

244
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,680
I swore in front of my grandfather

245
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,080
that I would kill the Qiao family in Lisu.

246
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
I won't marry her

247
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
until the revenge is over.

248
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Tell me.

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
Tell me.

250
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Which letter did Madam Tai

251
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
write to Master?

252
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,280
What's wrong with her?

253
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
Look for yourself.

254
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Hurry up.

255
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,680
The Qiao family is looking for a daughter.

256
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
The Qiao family is looking for a daughter?

257
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Master, calm down.

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
Think about it.

259
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,080
The years of struggle and the many attacks.

260
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,480
The new capital is in trouble.

261
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,580
If the Qiao family

262
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,280
is in a fight with Lisu,

263
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
it'll be a fierce battle.

264
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
The Qiao family

265
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,680
is forcing grandmother.

266
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,280
If I take down the new capital now,

267
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
will I

268
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
be able to get rid of grandmother's worries?

269
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,280
Brothers.

270
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Get to work.

271
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Master.

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,880
Master.

273
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,280
It's not a big deal to attack the city rashly.

274
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Go.

275
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,880
Go.

276
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,280
Fourteen years ago,

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,280
the Qiao family betrayed us.

278
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,880
They made our clan be killed.

279
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
The new capital fell into the hands of others.

280
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,080
Today,

281
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,680
the enemy is right in front of us.

282
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,080
All generals, listen to my order.

283
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Follow me into the city.

284
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Kill Lisu.

285
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
Destroy the Qiao family.

286
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Kill Lisu.

287
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,280
Destroy the Qiao family.

288
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Kill Lisu.

289
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,680
Destroy the Qiao family.

290
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Kill Lisu.

291
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Destroy the Qiao family.

292
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,880
Stop the battle!

293
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,080
Legs apart!

294
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,280
Bones apart!

295
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:02,560
's

296
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,920
ag

297
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,260
The

298
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm not afraid of death.

299
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,360
Manman,

300
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,680
don't worry.

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,640
Yanzhou is your home.

302
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
When I marry Wei Shao,

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Liang Yaguo will also value you.

304
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Yanzhou is your home.

305
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Fan.

306
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
I don't want to marry Wei Shao.

307
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I can't just leave with you like this.

308
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Wei Zhi,

309
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
we are going to be separated.

310
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Wei Shao,

311
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I'll fight with Wei Shao

312
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
to see if I can stop this marriage.

313
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
You are just a horse slave.

314
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
How can you make friends with him?

315
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
The End

316
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
You are awake.

317
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
You can't sleep.

318
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
I have something to discuss with you.

319
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Go ahead.

320
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
In the beginning of the year,

321
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
I helped you repair this wedding dress

322
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
with Xianxia and Chuning.

323
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
But I'm in a hurry to marry Wei Shao.

324
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
I think I'll leave home earlier than you.

325
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm leaving home.

326
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,680
Why don't you give me the wedding dress?

327
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
We are both going to get married.

328
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Why do you have more than me?

329
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Then I'll tell my mother

330
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
to give you more.

331
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Or you can take whatever you like from me.

332
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm not saying I want to fight with you.

333
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm just thinking

334
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
that we are going to be separated.

335
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
It's hard to see each other again.

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
You have to keep some things

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
you love with you.

338
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
So I can take them out

339
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
when I miss you.

340
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Don't you want to wear these two clothes?

341
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Here you are.

342
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Anything else?

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Thank you.

344
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
I'll give them to you.

345
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Anything else?

346
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
I made these myself.

347
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
I haven't worn them yet.

348
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Anything else?

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
No.

350
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
You have to give me

351
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
some things you love with you

352
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
so that we can be sisters in advance.

353
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
This is impossible.

354
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Don't worry.

355
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll keep these things for you.

356
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I'll give you

357
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
whatever you want.

358
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
As long as we can be together in the future,

359
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
it's perfect.

360
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Zhang Jie, too.

361
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
We are sisters.

363
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
You are the only one

364
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
who can marry me.

365
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
That's enough.

366
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
We are sisters.

367
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
As long as we can be together in the future,

368
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
that's enough.

369
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
I'll take you to a place

370
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
to put on clothes.

371
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Nuannuan.

372
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Nuannuan, where are we going?

373
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Nuannuan, what are you doing?

374
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
If you like her,

375
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
just go with her.

376
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
I won't go with her.

377
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
You have to go.

378
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
If you marry into the Wei family,

379
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
you'll be dead.

380
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm the daughter of Zhou Mu.

381
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,680
I've been using the public's contribution for years.

382
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I deserve all these.

383
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
If I tell you

384
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
I want to marry Wei Shao for you,

385
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
will you help me?

386
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
No.

387
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Wei Shao is not a good person.

388
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
I know.

389
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Listen to me.

390
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
A woman's marriage is not just two kinds.

391
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
One is like you

392
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
who is like a person who is in love with someone.

393
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
You can give up your love

394
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
and make a living out of it.

395
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Another kind is like me.

396
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't want my husband to be

397
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,680
beautiful for me.

398
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I want to see his status.

399
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I used to like Master Liu.

400
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
But I've seen it clearly recently.

401
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
He is not the person I want.

402
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
He is afraid of Wei Shao.

403
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
He is afraid of the low-level Yan State.

404
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
If so,

405
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
I might as well marry Wei Shao.

406
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
I'll marry him.

407
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
I'll make him lose his teeth and lose his strength.

408
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
If Zhang Jian didn't hide it,

409
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
these should be the things

410
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
you can't bear to lose.

411
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
But the Empress is too heavy.

412
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
I'll take off the front line for you.

413
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
You won't blame me, will you?

414
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Take it easy.

415
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Okay.

416
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
Don't move.

417
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll kill him today.

418
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I just don't want him to be caught.

419
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
But if I know

420
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
you're not good to him,

421
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll send someone to kill you.

422
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
If you really have a crush on him,

423
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
one day,

424
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
I'll ask for your help

425
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
from Uncle and Aunt.

426
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
I'll help you out.

427
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
If anything happens to you,

428
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,680
I'll be the one to take the blame.

429
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Let's go.

430
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I'll wait for you.

431
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Let's go.

432
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
Mom!

433
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
Bi Zhi.

434
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm begging you!

435
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Bi Zhi, let me go!

436
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Zhang Yilang is so naive.

437
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
He's leaving with Bi Zhi.

438
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
He's better off

439
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
marrying Wei Shao

440
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
than marrying him.

441
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
He should just eat me up.

442
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Yilang.

443
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
What are you going to do next?

444
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Go find Uncle.

445
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Hurry up!

446
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Madam, did you check the room?

447
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
No.

448
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Madam, hurry up!

449
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Madam, the bridegroom left a letter.

450
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
What's going on?

451
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Where is he?

452
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Where is he?

453
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Husband.

454
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
What should we do?

455
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Fan can't be cleaned up.

456
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Enough.

457
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
The marriage letter has been sent out.

458
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Madam Xu has agreed to this marriage.

459
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
If Marquis Wei attacks us

460
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
in the name of breaking the marriage,

461
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
what should we do?

462
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
We can just kill them.

463
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Zi, look at our men.

464
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Can we beat them?

465
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
I think

466
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,680
we should send Zhang Pu to the new capital

467
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
to apologize to Marquis Wei

468
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
for his lack of respect.

469
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
No.

470
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
How can I resist

471
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
the rage of Marquis Wei?

472
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Just say...

473
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
Just say that

474
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Fan was taken away by the bandits

475
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
when he went out.

476
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Husband, please don't do that.

477
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
The army of the Wei Valley is like a tiger and a wolf.

478
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm not a dog who can be killed

479
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
for nothing.

480
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Master, I have a plan to resolve this problem.

481
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Tell me.

482
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Since the wolf can't be found,

483
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
how about...

484
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
You mean

485
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
to let A'Man marry?

486
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Good idea.

487
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Husband.

488
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
What idea do you have?

489
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Good.

490
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
This is a good idea.

491
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
A'Man has already left a message.

492
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
A'Man has already left a message.

495
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
No.

496
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
Wei is strong and Liang is weak.

497
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,680
If we can only focus on Wei,

498
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
we will be dead.

499
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Brother, who is that young master?

500
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
At this time,

501
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
we should send A'Man there.

502
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
It's not a good idea.

503
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
What should we do?

504
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
We should find A'Man

505
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
as soon as possible.

506
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
It's not my destiny.

507
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
14 years ago,

508
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,680
I was in the city for three days.

509
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I was even escaped from the heaven by you.

510
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
Do you want to know

511
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,680
how I got away from the heaven?

512
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm afraid

513
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
you don't want to know

514
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,680
how I got away from the heaven.

515
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
But back then,

516
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,680
all three generations of your ancestors

517
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
died because of me.

518
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
It's a pity.

519
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
I only have one life.

520
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
It's worth it.

521
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
It's worth it.

522
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Master,

523
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
what should we do?

524
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Kill him.

525
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
It's not a good idea to kill him directly.

526
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Did you get it?

527
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Put it in my box.

528
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Brother.

529
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I can't kill him.

530
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Master,

531
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I can't kill him.

532
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Master.

533
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
I've got it.

534
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Master, you're impulsive.

535
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Everyone knows that you have a grudge against Li Su.

536
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
But you can't kill him.

537
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
It's a good thing for the people.

538
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
What's the use of it?

539
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I want Li Su to die.

540
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Although the master has the new map,

541
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,680
the people still need to help repair the city.

542
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Fourteen years ago,

543
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
after Li Su was destroyed,

544
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
the old and young people in the city

545
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
piled up the remains of their families.

546
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
They died for the sake of the map.

547
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Fourteen years ago,

548
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
the people of the new capital suffered too much war.

549
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
If we can find them now...

550
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I know.

551
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I know.

552
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,680
You want to persuade me to focus on the big picture.

553
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
The city of Su...

554
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Master,

555
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
I think the most important thing now is to repair the city.

556
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Don't take any more risks.

557
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
But I have different ideas from you.

558
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
I want to do it with my own hands.

559
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
I don't want to be a traitor.

560
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Manman,

561
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,680
you grew up in my debt.

562
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,680
You know how to calculate.

563
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
It's not good to live.

564
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,680
At least it's not difficult to live.

565
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Grandfather,

566
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
I'm thinking,

567
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
if you want this Marquis Wei to join us

568
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
according to my will,

569
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,680
you have to figure out what he wants from me.

570
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,680
The plate is the door of Yanzhou.

571
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
The water network is good.

572
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
If Wei Shao wants to fight in Yanzhou,

573
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
the first target must be the plate.

574
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
If I take the plate as a dowry,

575
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
why wouldn't he marry me?

576
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
You are stronger than your uncle and your father.

577
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,680
But you can't be a girl forever.

578
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Manman,

579
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,680
I don't know if God loves me or punishes me.

580
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Since I'm born a girl,

581
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,680
what else do you want to tell me?

582
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
That

583
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,680
it's better for him and Wei Xia.

584
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I married you 14 years ago.

585
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm going to rely on you to get married.

586
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,600
The Marquis Wei's

587
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
marriage is over.

588
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
This is the seal of Lord Pan.

589
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
I'll give it to you now.

590
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Thank you, uncle.

591
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Manman, don't blame uncle.

592
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I won't.

593
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Manman,

594
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
please.

595
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
The world is too soft to be watered.

596
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
I've been eating water all my life.

597
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
It's a reasonable reason.

598
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Take this.

599
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
It can protect your life.

600
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
If you're lucky,

601
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
when the Marquis is on your side,

602
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
you'll be in Yanzhou

603
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
to take the flower and the jade.

604
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
The article is here.

605
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Master,

606
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
all the food and soldiers in the city

607
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
have been cleaned and registered.

608
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Are you done cleaning the house now?

609
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
The people here

610
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
don't cooperate with each other.

611
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Why?

612
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
I won't say anything.

613
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
It's okay.

614
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,680
Just believe that you'll live.

615
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,440
Master.

616
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,960
Master.

617
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,240
Qiao Xia's remaining team

618
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,560
is almost at the gate.

619
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,800
You're not afraid of death.

620
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,160
You even sent her to the door.

621
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,440
Give it to me.

622
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,520
Master.

623
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,120
Master.

624
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,920
Master.

625
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Master, wait.

626
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,080
Since Qiao family wants to ask for your help,

627
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,960
why don't you marry me?

628
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,600
Can you marry Pan Yi?

629
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
Pan Yi

630
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
is not a good person

631
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,200
of the Ghost Army.

632
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
You should think twice.

633
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,160
The family of Qiao's daughter is so domineering.

634
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,000
The Yangshui is ten percent color.

635
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
The Shuangshu is eight percent.

636
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,400
The Shuangshu

637
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,360
is worth the two daughters of the Qiao family.

638
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,880
Let them in.

639
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
Open the gate.

640
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,560
But...

641
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,660
They're all

642
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,640
dos and don'ts together.

643
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,400
Why didn't you rest sooner?

644
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,680
I asked the soldiers for help

645
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
due to certain reasons.

646
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,360
Now New City is more than two stars.

647
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,360
The two things are not contradictory.

648
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Master, please think about it with me.

649
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,360
The whole Central Plains,

650
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
these cities are united.

651
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Does it look like a road?

652
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
This Yan State is defending.

653
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Wei State is defending.

654
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
Bian State is defending.

655
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
And Liang State is defending.

656
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,360
This Panye is a high-ranking city.

657
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
The land is high.

658
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
And it's the door of Yan State.

659
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Does it look like a road?

660
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,360
This Yan State is willing to give us this heart.

661
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,360
The condition is to ally.

662
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,360
It's worth it.

663
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,360
If he is willing to give me the Panye,

664
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
I will kill him.

665
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
It's already a mercy to him.

666
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Mr. Gongsun is famous all over the world.

667
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,360
I am very happy.

668
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Today, I am really very happy.

669
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
You are overpraising.

670
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,360
You are not as talented as Mr. Zhang.

671
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,360
This Yan State is indeed a place of the human world.

672
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Especially Panye,

673
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
it is more beautiful recently.

674
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
I was lucky to visit it.

675
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
But I haven't been there this year.

676
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,360
I don't know what kind of scenery it is now.

677
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
It's a coincidence.

678
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Panye is the dowry prepared by my master for the bridegroom.

679
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
After the wedding,

680
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,360
the military counselor can come to the village together.

681
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
That's great.

682
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Since it's like this,

683
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
then the master and the bridegroom

684
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,360
will have the wedding in Panye.

685
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,360
I think the new capital is very beautiful.

686
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,360
It's perfect for the Marquis Wei to have a wedding here.

687
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
How can the new capital be better than Panye?

688
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Besides, it's just a small town.

689
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
It's not a big city.

690
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
It's a small town.

691
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
It's a small town.

692
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,360
It's a small town.

693
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
It's a small town.

694
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
It's a small town.

695
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
It's a small town.

696
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,360
It's a small town.

697
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I think we've just had a big battle here.

698
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
We're worried about nothing.

699
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Panye is not only the Marquis Wei's soldier.

700
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
The marriage between the two families is a big deal.

701
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
I'm afraid it will disturb them.

702
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Panye's climate is better.

703
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
The temperature of the new capital is different.

704
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Panye is the home of the bridegroom.

705
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
The new capital is the land of Marquis Wei.

706
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Why are they looking for this?

707
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
The master of Weiguo

708
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
will marry Panye first.

709
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Yanzhou will marry Panye first.

710
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,360
What if they take back the seal?

711
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
So we can't let this go.

712
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Go.

713
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,360
There was a funeral in the new capital.

714
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Fourteen years ago,

715
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,360
thousands of people buried their bones here.

716
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Don't worry about it.

717
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,360
If you don't have sincerity,

718
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
you can go back to the mansion

719
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
and send them back.

720
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,360
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,360
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,360
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,360
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,360
I have nothing to ask for.

736
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,360
I only wish.

737
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,360
I once saw the world through the window.

738
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,360
That bright light.

739
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,360
The wind and fire are together.

740
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,360
I want to be tender and humble forever.

741
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
A glance at the stars.

742
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,360
How can I forget it in my life?

743
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,360
I want to cross the sea of clouds and hold your hand.

744
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,360
Waiting for you to appear.

745
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,360
The words of Jiangnan are not in your eyes.

746
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I want to stay in your heart.

747
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,360
I want to cut your smile.

748
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,360
Even if the world is in chaos.

749
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,360
No matter how many times I have to repeat it.

750
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:23,360
I will never forget it in my life.

751
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,360
I want to cross the sea of clouds and hold your hand.

752
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,360
Waiting for you to appear.

00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,360
The words of Jiangnan are not in your eyes.

00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,360
I want to stay in your heart.

00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,360
Even if the world is in chaos.

757
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,360
