00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,790
that I've entrusted Lady Qiao

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,740
with the Deer Hunt Venue.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,340
Let's see how can he can avoid her now.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,590
Who said I can't live without her?

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,460
I think the Government Office

36
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,790
is far better than home.

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,500
At least here, I feel free.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,270
My Lord,

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,740
have some hot ginger soup before bed

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
to warm you up.

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,030
How thoughtful. Everything's better now.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,550
I'm glad the Lord slept well last night.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,420
The dishes tonight

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,180

45
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,830
Bring them to him later.

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,150
If anything is missing, go buy it

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,990
or come back to get it.

48
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,460
If you're short on money,
ask Xiaotao for more.

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,740
Thank you for caring for the Lord.

50
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,270
I will make sure he is looked after

51
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,340
as if he were at home.

52
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,270
Are you trying to make him
never want to come back?

53
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,780
I don't have such deep thoughts.

54
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,550
I just want him to live comfortably.

55
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,750

so thoughtful suddenly?

81
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,100
It's made in the kitchen at home.

82
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,460
You'll definitely like it.

83
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,390
This...

84
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,420
Who prepared it?

85
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,780
Of course, it was the Lady.

86
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,870
The Lady?

87
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,100
What about this balm?

88
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,980
Also the Lady.

89
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,590
- The hand warmer?
- Also the Lady.

90
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,690
Why did you smile yesterday

91
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,690
when I praised you?

92
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,300
Weren't you praising the Lady?

93
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,750
Though I'm at the office,

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,510
I'm still caught in the web.

95
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,900
If you don't like it,

96
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,460
I'll prepare something else.

97
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,590
No need.

98
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,710
I'll just make do.

99
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,830
What has the Lady

100
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,950
been doing these days?

101
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,510
Besides instructing me every day

102
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,780
to care for you,

103
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,220
she's been busy with the renovation
of Deer Hunt Venue.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,860
I heard

105
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,980
she's anxious to find someone

106
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,510
to write poetic exposition to boost

107
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,840
the popularity of the Deer Hunt.

108
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,950
Do you know there's a scholar

109
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,340
skilled in poetic expositions

110
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,540
and full of talent,

111
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,710
named Gao Heng?

112
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,190
Master Zhenshi, Gao Heng,

113
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,290
is famed across the states,

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,250
admired by many.

115
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,780
The weather changed so fast.

116
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,030
It suddenly turned cold.

117
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,630
Yes.

118
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,190
Since the Lord is staying at the office,

119
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,660
hurry and prepare more clothes

120
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,780
to send to him.

121
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,190
Yes, yes.

122
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,100
I know you care deeply for the Lord.

123
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,070
Your hands are busy,

124
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,340
but your mouth isn't idle either.

125
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,070
Send him

126
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,510
another hand warmer.

127
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,390
Be careful.

128
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,100
That's his beloved item.

129
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,590
You can't touch this box.

130
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,900
Lady Yulou and the Lord

131
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,710
were almost betrothed.

132
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,070
Xiaozao,

133
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,900
about the jade pendant the Lord wears,

134
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,420
Lady Yulou seems to have one too.

135
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,900
Didn't Xiaotao say

136
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,950
Lady Yulou almost married
into the Wei Clan?

137
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,980
But don't worry, My Lady.

138
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,590
That's all in the past.

139
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,190
I'm afraid it's not in the past.

140
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,780
This is the dessert from Danjun?

141
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,620
Yes.

142
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,630
Why did you prepare this for me?

143
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,860
The Lady arranged it.

144
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,340
She said you'd surely like it.

145
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,340
I'd surely like it?

146
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,780
Take it away.

147
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,620
I don't like it.

148
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,820
Yes.

149
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,190
Where's my hand warmer?

150
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,630
It was taken back

151
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,950
to the mansion.

152
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,830
Back to the mansion?

153
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,390
The Lady said

154
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,270
the office is for working hard.

155
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,300
It shouldn't be made
as comfortable as home.

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,710
It would hinder your diligence.

157
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,660
What happened?

158
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,560
I even praised her today
in front of others

159
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,930
for her meticulous care.

160
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,540
She asked you to take it away,
so you did?

161
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,950
Whose side are you on?

162
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,190
Go get it back for me.

163
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,340
I'm on it.

164
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,550
Wait.

165
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,660
It's already late.

166
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,220
Don't disturb her rest.

167
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,870
Do it tomorrow.

168
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,550
Yes.

169
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,470
Why is this box here?

170
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,780
The Lady sent it.

171
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,660
She said it's your cherished item

172
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
and should be kept close.

173
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,750
You may leave now.

174
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
Yes.

175
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,420
Shao,

176
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,660
promise me two things.

177
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,060
Don't trust anyone from the Qiao Clan.

178
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,180
And take care of her for me.

179
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,540
You

180
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,150
have fallen in love

181
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,870
but still care about filial duty.

182
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,820
That will only

183
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,180
bring you pain.

184
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,900
Tomorrow, find some tavern maids

185
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,470
who resemble this goddess

186
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,180
in figure and charm.

187
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,260
Yes.

188
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,030
Why are you back?

189
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,230
The office is damp.

190
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,030
My headache flared up.

191
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,750
So tonight,

192
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,030
I'll sleep in the bedchamber.

193
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,060
As you wish.

194
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
What are you doing?

195
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,700
Fixing the pillow.

196
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,950
Perfect timing. Let me try it.

197
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
I have

198
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,950
a headache.

199
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,660
- Listen.
- Listen.

200
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,900
Let me go first.

201
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,030
My Lord...

202
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,920
This box holds the belongings

203
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,350
of my grandfather,

204
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,660
father,

205
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,700
and elder brother.

206
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,540
I shouldn't have taken the liberty.

208
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,300
It was my fault.

209
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,060
I should've told you earlier.

210
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,540
This jade pendant

211
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,390
is actually one half.

212
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,180
Before my brother died,

213
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,820
he split it in two

214
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,470
and asked me to give the other half

215
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,110
to Lady Yulou

216
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,940
because they were

217
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,390
almost betrothed.

218
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,580
My brother had excelled

219
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,190
in martial arts since he was a child.

220
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,180
He was known as the destined patriarch.

221
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,150
He followed Grandfather

222
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,180
into battle

223
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
and never lost a fight

224
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,350
until the Xindu Battle.

225
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,350
Then he became a scar

226
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,820
of Mother and me

227
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,390
that never healed.

228
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,230
So, from a young age,

229
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,580
I've told myself

230
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,940
to grow up to be brave,

231
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,150
kind,

232
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,990
and responsible

233
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,540
like him.

234
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,270
I still wonder if I can ever

235
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,150
measure up to him in Mother's eyes.

236
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,630
You're the best patriarch

237
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,470
the Wei Clan has ever had.

238
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,110
Before my brother died,
he asked two things of me.

239
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,820
The first was

240
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,900
to take care of Lady Yulou

241
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,510
on his behalf.

242
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,990
The second...

243
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,940
I failed to fulfill.

244
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,420
Do you

245
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,580
have a style name?

246
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,580
It's Manman.

247
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,470
Manman.

248
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,500
(Boya)

249
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,460
General,

250
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,270
there's been another raid
from Bianzhou today.

251
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,000
Thankfully,
they only took some livestock.

252
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,160
A few commoners were injured.

253
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,300
General, please come up with a solution.

254
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,020
Alright. I understand.

255
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,030
You may go.

256
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Darling, is something troubling you?

258
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,740
Fan.

259
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,060
(Qiao)

260
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,990
Did I wake you just now?

261
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,350
It's still early.

262
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,590
Why don't you go back to sleep?

263
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,990
Why won't you tell me what's going on?

264
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,470
There was another raid

265
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,470
from Bianzhou.

266
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,540
No major losses were caused,

267
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,030
but this is the third time

268
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,470
this month.

269
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,060
Why didn't you tell me

270
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,630
something so serious?

271
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,300
Lady Ding and Ci are here.

272
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,750
I didn't want them to worry,

273
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,630
so I kept quiet.

274
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,180
I sought help from Father,

275
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,580
but he remained silent.

276
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,150
He won't send reinforcements.

277
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,760
He must have his reasons

278
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,830
for not doing that.

279
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,190
But I won't show weakness,

280
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,670
or he'll look down on me,

281
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,030
and you might not

282
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,860
be welcomed home again.

283
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,140
Bi Zhi.

284
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,350
Fan.

285
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,270
I know you worry for me,

286
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,860
but the Lady is right.

287
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,270
If I don't make something of myself,

288
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,230
how could I be worthy of you?

289
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,780
I've followed her instructions

290
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,430
and started to build roads

291
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,720
from Liancheng to Xiaogang.

292
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,860
That is what truly matters.

293
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,270
As for the rest,

294
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,590
they don't.

295
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,620
Since Father refuses to help,

296
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,750
I'll write to Manman

297
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,270
and ask if she can help.

298
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,470
But in the end,

299
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,540
the Qiao Clan's banner

300
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,340
is still flying in Boya.

301
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,780
Why would the Lord of Wei

302
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,380
vouch for me?

303
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,270
You fool.

304
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,750
I'll say

305
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,470
since the Deer Hunt is coming,

306
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,510
we'd like to visit them for the event.

307
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,230
Yeah.

308
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,710
If I attend,

309
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,230
the world will know

310
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,750
the Lord of Wei sees me as an in-law,

311
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,060
and if anyone dares invade Boya later,

312
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,510
they'll think twice.

313
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,780
We'll have to take a risk

314
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,950
and see if the Lord of Wei

315
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,430
has a place in his heart for Manman.

316
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,340
(To Manman)

317
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,540
Why didn't I see you

318
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,580
in the tavern before?

319
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm a Yu.

320
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,060
I've admired you for a long time.

321
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,580
Good.

322
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,270
I'll come by another time.

323
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,910
I'll be waiting.

324
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,710
Lower

325
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
your head.

326
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,140
Zhu Quan,

327
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,710
send them back.

328
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,030
Yes.

329
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,310
My Lord,

330
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,670
Master Zhenshi, who was invited
for the poetic exposition,

331
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,620
has arrived in Yujun.

332
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,190
He said

333
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,910
he wanted to explore the scenery

334
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,190
before he could begin writing.

335
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,590
Let him be.

336
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,820
Treat him well.

337
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,660
Yes.

338
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,950
Chunniang sent these
honeyed drinks and cakes

339
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,540
on the Lady's orders.

340
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,470
Why didn't she

341
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,540
bring it herself?

342
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,540
She's at Deer Hunt Venue,

343
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,670
overseeing the renovations.

344
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,540
Any other orders, My Lord?

345
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,710
Pick out a few hairpins

346
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,100
in the latest

347
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,950
and finest styles for me.

348
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,940
Yes.

349
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,430
What a rare gathering.

350
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,430
Let's raise our glass.

351
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,060
- Mother.
- To grandmother.

352
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,340
Though it's late now,

353
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,030
the room feels

354
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,990
particularly radiant.

355
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,190
It must be because of Grandmother

356
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,540
and Aunt's beautiful new jewelry,

357
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,540
so you look much more stunning.

358
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,670
During the day, Zhonglin

359
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,140
noticed my hairpin was worn,

360
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,990
so he brought a new one tonight.

361
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,030
He also got one for Mother
and Lady Qiao too.

362
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,100
He's mainly trying to be filial to you.

363
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
I just benefited from that.

364
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,060
Shiyuan,

365
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,380
what's wrong with you?

366
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,710
Three of us have new jewelry,

367
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,190
but you only complimented two.

368
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Can't you see the hairpin

369
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,270
on Lady Qiao's head?

370
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,230
Grandmother,

371
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,430
Zhonglin should be the one

372
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,100
complimenting Lady Qiao,

373
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,470
while I can focus

374
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,540
on cheering up you two.

375
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,710
Of course, we're happy.

376
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,820
I really like the hairpin from you.

377
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,140
The craftsman had

378
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,470
some material left

379
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,620
so he made yours

380
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,750
with it.

381
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,230
Still,

382
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,910
I'm glad you like it.

383
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,950
Zhonglin,

384
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,950
you meant well.

385
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,340
Why say such things?

386
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,030
Is it so hard

387
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,230
to say something nice?

388
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,270
You're right.

389
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,990
Let's drink.

390
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,380
To Grandmother.

391
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,780
Mr. Wei really is something.

392
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,100
That girl is completely obsessed
with him now.

393
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,470
She's driven off every suitor.

394
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,510
She'll marry no one but him.

395
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,580
Really?

396
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,230
Where did you hear that gossip?

397
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,340
The whole city's talking about it.

398
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,540
She says

399
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,540
she sees him every day

400
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,230
and spends every night

401
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,580
with him.

402
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,230
She even has a keepsake from him.

403
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,190
She's a girl, after all.

404
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,380
With that much detail,

405
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,540
it's gotta be true.

406
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,100
Is Mr. Wei getting married?

407
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,750
I don't think so.

408
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,340
We know him.

409
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,380
He's engaged with half the girls here.

410
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
He's always been a flirt.

411
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,670
It's not likely that he'll tie himself

412
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,340
to one woman.

413
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,580
So, he gave her affection

414
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,860
but no promise.

415
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,710
That'll ruin her life.

416
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,670
You're too naive.

417
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,860
Who is this good girl?

418
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,750
A Yu in the east of the city.

419
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,820
I've never heard of her.

420
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,910
Why are you here gossiping

421
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,190
instead of being on duty?

422
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,950
Mr. Wei, we're waiting for the Lord.

423
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,040
- Close the door.
- Sure.

424
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,430
We're waiting for the Lord to head
to the office.

425
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,470
You shouldn't have asked.

426
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,710
You mentioned it first.

427
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,580
Shiyuan

428
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,140
has always been messy

429
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,430
with women.

430
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,580
I'm not surprised

431
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
that he's messing

432
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,230
with a good girl.

433
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,910
Mr. Wei never mentioned this.

434
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,990
We don't know if it's true yet.

435
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,590
I've seen plenty of girls claiming

436
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,910
to hold his keepsakes.

437
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,190
Some have a rouge box,

438
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,300
and some have a wooden comb.

439
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,100
I wonder

440
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,780
what it is this time.

441
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,950
My Lady,

442
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,620
this time

443
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,190
it's a flute.

444
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,110
A flute?

445
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,580
Then it might be true.

446
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,340
If she's someone

447
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,950
Shiyuan really likes,

448
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,140
I'd like to meet her.

449
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,990
What's all the chatter about?

450
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,270
- It's about you.
- Let me hear it.

451
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,350
Grandmother.

452
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,270
Aunt.

453
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,540
It's your flirtatious debts.

454
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,540
There's gossip all over the city.

455
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,190
A girl claimed to have your keepsake,

456
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,190
said she was engaged to you,

457
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,770
and swore she'd marry no one else.

458
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,300
She said you invited her home to paint.

459
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,620
Mr. Wei, do you know anything
about this?

460
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,620
Painting?

461
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,780
Was it a tavern maid surnamed Yu?

462
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,060
What tavern maid?

463
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,430
She's a girl from a decent family.

464
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,880
You found her?

465
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,850
If you keep this up,

466
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,530
I won't help you
find anyone next time.

467
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,990
So, you do know she's a Yu.

468
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,100
Then she does exist.

469
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,470
Grandmother,

470
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,670
it's a misunderstanding.

471
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,750
That day...

472
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,190
If she's truly the one you want,

473
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,710
we don't care about her background.

474
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,860
Shall I arrange

475
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,540
the betrothal?

476
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,270
It was just one meeting.

477
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,640
If I truly care for someone,

478
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,230
I'll ask you to arrange it for me.

479
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,340
I'm tired.

480
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm leaving.

481
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,860
Mr. Wei.

482
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,670
What's wrong?

483
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,910
I have an appointment.

484
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,670
Would you like to join me?

485
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,380
Who is it?

486
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,950
I've sent someone to fetch her.

487
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,100
Miss Yu, I invited you here today

488
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,030
to hear your thoughts

489
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,710
and to settle

490
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,910
all the rumors.

491
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,060
My Lady,

492
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,540
I was once intimate

493
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,100
with Mr. Wei.

494
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,860
I've rejected all other suitors for him.

495
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,540
I'd gladly be his wife or concubine.

496
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
I will marry

497
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,300
no one else.

498
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
I've given him my heart.

499
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,430
Just last night,

500
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,990
he treated me tenderly,

501
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,230
smiled at me,

502
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,430
gave me a keepsake,

503
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,270
held me close, and kissed me.

504
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,860
You mean last night?

505
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,270
We've been together every night.

506
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,030
Last night was no exception.

507
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,750
There was a family banquet last night.

508
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,030
Was it later last night?

509
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,100
Yes.

510
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,270
It was later than usual.

511
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,950
Last night,
Mr. Wei got drunk at the banquet.

512
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,580
He rested at the mansion as arranged.

513
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,510
He didn't go out again.

514
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,060
How did you

515
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,270
meet him?

516
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,780
Perhaps I remembered wrong.

517
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,230
He didn't come last night.

518
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,780
But usually,

519
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,340
he comes every day.

520
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,270
If you can't recall

521
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,780
what happened last night,

522
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,230
how can we trust

523
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,140
what you said about before?

524
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,860
I have his keepsake.

525
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,380
Everything I said is true.

526
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,230
Mr. Wei and I truly love each other.

527
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,510
I must marry him.

528
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,380
We don't know

529
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,030
whether what you have

530
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,510
is proof or a stolen item.

531
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,580
Being a weak woman doesn't mean

532
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,670
you can use it to oppress Mr. Wei.

533
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,030
My Lady,

534
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,820
she just

535
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,620
admired Mr. Wei deeply,

536
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,930
so she was momentarily confused

537
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,530
and disguised herself as a tavern maid
to sneak into the mansion.

538
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,710
She just wanted to see him,

539
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,510
yet he treated her so gently.

540
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,920
That's how she wanted something more.

541
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,340
My Lady,

542
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540
please show mercy

543
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,860
for her sincere love.

544
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,510
How unfair.

545
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,100
Love has now become

546
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,990
an excuse to make false accusations.

547
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,910
Take Miss Yu home.

548
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,670
Watch her closely.

549
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,060
Thank you, My Lady.

550
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,430
My Lady.

551
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,670
Chunniang,

552
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,990
spread the word:

553
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,710
This must not be talked about again.

554
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,270
A woman's reputation matters.

555
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,710
Don't ruin her future.

556
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,790
Yes, My Lady.

557
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,190
Rest assured.

558
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,030
Why did you do that?

559
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,140
I am the Lady of the Wei Clan,

560
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,860
so I should get to decide
everything about women.

561
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,100
I just don't understand.

562
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Since you were wrongly accused,

563
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,340
why didn't you defend yourself?

564
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,750
I'm a man.

565
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,270
Why care about reputation?

566
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,860
Besides, I've had affairs with many.

567
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,510
What's one more?

568
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,270
Still, I didn't expect you

569
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,860
to defend me like this.

570
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,430
Reputation, good or bad,

571
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,750
should come
from what you've actually done,

572
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,430
not from false accusations.

573
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,300
I'm your family.

574
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,270
Of course,
I won't let you suffer injustice.

575
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,620
Everyone thinks I'm a rake

576
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,380
and it's no surprise for me to do this.

577
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,670
Why do you

578
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,060
see me

579
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,230
differently?

580
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,430
Perhaps it's because I believe

581
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,820
I understand your character.

582
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,140
Even if your words
are sometimes flirtatious,

583
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,580
you would never

584
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,300
deceive and abandon a woman.

585
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,780
Grandmother protects me,

586
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,340
and Zhonglin defends me,

587
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,380
even when they think

588
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,270
I'm wrong.

589
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,940
Thank you.

590
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,620
Miss Yu loved Mr. Wei,

591
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,990
so

592
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,380
she picked up his flute,

593
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,030
hoping it would lead to marriage.

594
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,190
Unexpectedly,

595
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,060
Mr. Wei had no such intentions.

596
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,430
Fate

597
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,430
can't be forced.

598
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,310
Yes.

599
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,990
Seeing

600
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,300
how Zhonglin and his wife

601
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,990
live so harmoniously,

602
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,670
I just hope Shiyuan

603
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,510
can get married soon

604
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,140
so he won't end up alone

605
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,140
like his mother.

606
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,470
Don't worry, My Lady.

607
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,430
Mr. Wei

608
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,510
will definitely find someone he loves.

609
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,620

me?

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,190
Alright.

641
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,630
If you have nothing else to say,

642
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,470
you may leave.

643
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,420
My Lord,

644
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,270
this is a letter from Boya to the Lady.

645
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,750
What does it say?

646
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,030
Not much.

647
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,480
Just the same praise about how good

648
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,670
the general is to his wife.

649
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,050
She's bragging about her husband.

650
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,950
Nothing new.

651
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,540
Bi Zhi listens to his wife
in everything.

652
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,540
I've never seen a man
so devoted to his wife.

653
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,310
How can a man

654
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,540
be controlled like this?

655
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,220
You don't get it.

656
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,950
I heard it from Wei Qu.

657
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,950
He said

658
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,060
the general and his wife

659
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,310
went through a lot
to be together, right?

660
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,260
I saw that myself in Boya.

661
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,910
Their bond is truly

662
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,660
beyond ordinary couples.

663
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,220
The Lord and the Lady
have been through a lot too,

664
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,090
but I don't see the Lady
controlling the Lord.

665
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,310
Wait, Wei Liang.

666
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,550
Why are you suddenly talking

667
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,870
about love today?

668
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,510
Are you thinking of getting married?

669
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,620
With whom?

670
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,700
Alright, you may leave.

671
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,310
My Lord.

672
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,390
I have a report.

673
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,420
Speak.

674
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,930
Master Zhenshi has finished
the poetic exposition.

675
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,470
Already?

676
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,310
Didn't he say earlier

677
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,510
he had no inspiration

678
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,760
even after touring all of Wei?

679
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,140
He just suddenly got inspired?

680
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,520
It's said that he strolled

681
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,040
around the drill ground for two hours

682
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,660
and started writing on the spot.

683
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,660
That old man

684
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,790
is quite interesting.

685
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,470
My Lord,

686
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,430
Master Zhenshi is no elder.

687
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,990
He is a young and handsome man.

688
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,660
Young

689
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,750
and handsome?

690
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,920
I'll head to the drill ground.

691
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,220
My Lord,

692
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,620
he's a rare talent.
Please treat him with respect.

693
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,860
(Yujun, Wei)

694
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,460
(Shi)

695
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,460
(Bian)

696
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,700
(Xi)

697
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,280
(Gao Heng, a famous scholar)

698
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,510
How brilliant.

699
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,790
To compose like that on the spot

700
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,470
is truly beyond us.

701
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,790
Indeed.

702
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,700
It was only by coming here

703
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,030
that I finally found inspiration.

704
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,990
Master Zhenshi,

705
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,130
with such striking features,

706
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,370
is not only good-looking

707
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,720
but also talented in literature.

708
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,310
You have finally finished.

709
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,700
Let's read it.

710
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,870
- Yes.
- Right.

711
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,790
Such elegant writing.

712
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,870
Every word is a gem.

713
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,180
His diction and structure

714
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,310
are far beyond our reach.

715
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,790
- Truly.
- Yeah.

716
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,620
When all states prosper,

717
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,990
the world will have peace.

718
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,940
The water from the Yang River
is accessible

719
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,180
thanks to the Yongning Canal,

720
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,540
which runs over 700 li,

721
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,910
chasing the sun across the sky.

722
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,910
The walls of legacy are painted

723
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,580
with the contributions

724
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,620
of Lady Qiao.

725
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,100
Once I entered Xindu,

726
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,870
I saw the people living in harmony,

727
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,660
and the Lady, as pretty as a lotus,

728
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,180
walking like the drifting wind,

729
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,910
like a goddess among clouds

730
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,540
wherever she goes.

731
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,510
My Lord, you invited him

732
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,060
to praise Wei and the Deer Hunt,

733
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,700
yet he spoke of the Lady endlessly.

734
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,510
Master Zhenshi.

735
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,260
My Lord.

736
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,140
Master Zhenshi,

737
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,060
your talent is exceptional.

738
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,950
But with your strong build,

739
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,490
you don't look like a scholar,

740
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,220
more like a soldier.

741
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,180
You flatter me.

742
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,060
I've never practiced martial arts.

743
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,950
I'm as weak as a scholar should be.

744
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,430
Weak?

745
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,430
Really.

746
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,740
Each has their own path.

747
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,430
In combat,

748
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,620
you're unmatched.

749
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,910
In words and verse,

750
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,350
I won't yield

751
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,390
to anyone.

752
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,260
Indeed.

753
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,140
Master Zhenshi's exposition
is brilliant.

754
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,060
What a vivid portrait
you painted of the Lady.

755
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,220
"As pretty as a lotus,"

756
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,660
"walking like the drifting wind,"

757
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,990
"like a goddess among clouds"

758
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,700
"wherever she goes."

759
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,260
Once carved into a wall,

760
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,430
her beauty will echo

761
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,140
- through the ages.
- Exactly.

762
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,260
Carved into a wall?

763
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,390
Had I known that,

764
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,310
I wouldn't have read it so soon.

765
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,260
So,

766
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,870
you admit the piece is good?

767
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't rush, My Lord.

768
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,100
I have one more line

769
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,060
to praise the Lady's handwriting.

770
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,740
With strokes like dragons

771
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,790
and strength like bamboo,

772
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,790
each motion

773
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,260
gleams with grace.

774
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,790
I've heard

775
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,870
the Lady's calligraphy

776
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,910
is refined and elegant.

777
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,100
If carved into a wall,

778
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,220
it'd rival

779
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,580
the famed Moya Inscriptions in Yunzhong,

780
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,660
leaving a legacy for future generations.

781
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,830
You're flattering me.

782
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,180
I've always wanted

783
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,100
to see the Moya Inscriptions

784
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,790
but never found the chance.

785
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,950
What's inscriptional?

786
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,910
It's not that.

787
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,870
It's the Moya Inscriptions.

788
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,510
Speaking of which, my top choice
is the Ode to Yunmen.

789
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,620
Its brushwork is wild,

790
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,540
and its structure is unbound.

791
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,860
It combined the large
and small seal scripts.

792
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,220
Its strokes are
like the clerical script.

793
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,950
Its writing

794
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,700
is free and ethereal,

795
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,870
full of imagination.

796
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,350
With changes

797
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,580
in the weather and light,

798
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,260
the inscriptions

799
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,790
seem

800
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,790
to have also changed.

801
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,870
My Lady,

802
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,990
if you want to view them,

803
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,540
I'd gladly be

804
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,100
your guide.

805
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,030
Why should you be her guide?

806
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,990
How could I trouble you?

807
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,470
I'm still new in Yujun.

808
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,470
I must care for Grandmother and Mother.

809
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,790
It's not convenient to travel.

810
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,060
That's right.

811
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,740
If you ever wish to go,

812
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,830
just tell me,

813
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,670
and I'll take you.

814
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,350
Actually,

815
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
there's no rush.

816
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,660
The Lady's visit to the inscriptions

817
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,910
is for later.

818
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,030
Today,

819
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,350
My Lady,

820
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,580
please write this for me.

821
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,350
A masterpiece

822
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,140
should be matched

823
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,620
with your calligraphy.

824
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,430
I think that won't be necessary.

825
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,060
Sir, I wasn't finished just now.

826
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,350
Your exposition is brilliant,

827
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,030
but it's off-topic.

828
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,950
I invited you here

829
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,990
to praise

830
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
the great land of Wei,

831
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,220
not the Lady.

832
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,220
Sir, your vision

833
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,430
is limited.

834
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,430
You're absolutely right.

835
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,150
I'll revise it.

836
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,540
I'll revise it at once.

837
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,310
However,

838
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,180
the Lady

839
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,540
truly is

840
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,990
a rare

841
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,030
and talented woman

842
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,580
in this world.

843
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,700
Every word I spoke

844
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,540
came from my heart.

845
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,830
Then let this piece

846
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,390
be a gift to you, My Lady,

847
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,620
to show

848
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,220
my admiration to you.

849
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,140
Your words are too precious.

850
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,260
I dare not accept.

851
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,100
Yes.

852
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,430
We must decline your offer.

853
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,180
Of course,

854
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,700
it won't be carved into any wall.

855
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,190
Master Zhenshi,

856
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,030
please rewrite

857
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,350
the whole thing.

858
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,380
You'd better

859
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,870
compose a song.

860
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,760
Don't go wandering off

861
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,060
until it's done.

862
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,380
Let's go.

863
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,470
Tan, escort Master Zhenshi back.

864
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,310
Yes.

865
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,580
My Lord.

866
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,350
My Lord.

867
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,060
Wait, that's a dead end.

868
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,310
You need to go this way.

869
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,910
One day,

870
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,180
I hope to invite the Lady
to see the Moya Inscriptions.

871
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,350
She has no time.

872
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,030
You're always busy with state affairs.

873
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,060
What

874
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,660
brings you here today?

875
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,220
Master Zhenshi

876
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,540
truly is gifted

877
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,660
and handsome.

878
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,390
No wonder so many women

879
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,350
admire him.

880
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,740
If so many admire him,

881
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,220
he must have met real beauties,

882
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,030
yet he stays above it all,

883
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,830
with a heart set on scenery.

884
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,260
Why aren't you wearing
the hairpin I gave you?

885
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:01,510
You said you made it casually.

886
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,950
I figured you didn't like it,

887
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:03,950
so I didn't wear it.

888
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,220
How could I have had it made casually?

889
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,890
I put a lot of thought into that gift.

890
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,540
Thank you, My Lord.
