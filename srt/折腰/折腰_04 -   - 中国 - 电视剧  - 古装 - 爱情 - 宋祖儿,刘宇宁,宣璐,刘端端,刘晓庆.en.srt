00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,850
If the Qiao family hadn't betrayed,

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,700
my father and brothers wouldn't have died,

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,340
my mother

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,260
wouldn't have died of grief,

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,300
and I

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,290
wouldn't have become

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,980
a wild child fighting wolves for food.

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,210
So,

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,900
the Qiaos

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,650
all deserve death.

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,460
My Lord,

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,490
why?

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,580
She saved Xindu.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,210
Orders from Lord: Capture Lady Qiao.

44
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,180
Kill her for morale.

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,020
Yes!

46
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,810
Search every corner!

47
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,810
Capture Lady Qiao!

48
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,930
Kill her for morale!

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,810
Yes!

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,140
Search the city thoroughly!

51
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,020
Kill Lady Qiao for morale!

52
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,900
Understood.

53
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,250
Xiaoqiao.

54
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,410
Xiaoqiao.

55
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,340
Come here, I'll protect you.

56
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,650
Xiaoqiao.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,780
I took refuge with the Qiao family at age 13.

58
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,740
At 18, I returned to Liangya.

59
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,500
Those five years with the Qiaos

60
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,210
were the happiest of my life.

61
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,380
My feelings for you

62
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,730
is unchanging for lifetimes.

63
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,740
I know

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,460
you're full of doubts right now.

65
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,450
Don't be afraid.

66
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,090
I've thought it all through.

67
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,900
Just come with me,

68
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,260
and I can pretend none of this happened.

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,130
My Lord,

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,410
won't you say something?

71
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,690
Come here.

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,170
Better if you hadn't spoken.

73
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,370
Manman,

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,380
I consider you as a jewel.

75
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,650
You do see me as a jewel,

76
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,970
but you treat all others as ants!

77
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,730
Shoot!

78
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Loose arrows!

79
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,580
Stop!

80
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,940
Kill them!

81
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,700
The theft of your wife demands vengeance,

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,610
but not today.

83
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,610
Go! Go now!

84
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,090
- Attack!
- Kill them!

85
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,530
Protect Young Master Liu!

86
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,850
Go! Let's go!

87
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,650
- Kill!
- Charge!

88
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,650
Traitor Liu, don't you run!

89
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,300
Xiao, let's capture him.

90
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Charge!

91
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,940
Kill him!

92
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,130
Does it hurt?

93
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,860
Here?

94
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,340
You're being delicate.

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,850
Back on the battlefield,

96
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,380
some had their legs broken,

97
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,050
even the bones exposed.

98
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,970
They just wrapped it up
and kept fighting.

99
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,500
Why cry over this scratch?

100
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,460
Yes, it's all my fault.

101
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,780
Blame me, a spoiled girl,

102
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
for not being as tough

103
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,700
as the soldiers

104
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,610
in your troops

105
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,530
who can forge their shattered bones anew,

106
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,940
hardened like steel.

107
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,780
That's why I'm unworthy to be with you.

108
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,380
No need

109
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,460
for that tone.

110
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,850
I'm not crying over this wound.

111
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,290
My pain is nothing

112
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,580
compared to

113
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,730
the people's suffering.

114
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,210
Then why?

115
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,290
I just never thought

116
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,710
we'd meet again after I left Xindu.

117
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,260
If Wei Xiao's arrow had killed me,

118
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,140
I wouldn't have

119
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,100
heard your kind words just now.

120
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,380
I stopped him, didn't I?

121
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,740
But what about "kill Lady Qiao for morale"?

122
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,860
You'd rather kill the innocent
than spare the guilty.

123
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,200
You had no proof, yet you still believed

124
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
that I'd eloped with Liu Yan,

125
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,260
while I burned the sulfur for you,

126
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,140
and even helped you take the city.

127
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,860
You should've stayed out of it.

128
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,260
Matters of war

129
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,410
are no place for a woman to meddle.

130
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,530
You nearly died here.

131
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,170
If my life can buy the lives

132
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,140
of the people, then it's worth it.

133
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,740
The Qiao family has always

134
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,860
protected the people

135
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,020
and the soldiers,

136
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,740
never letting one die in vain.

137
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,290
It has never changed since 14 years ago.

138
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,250
Fine.

139
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,020
It's my fault for meddling.

140
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,690
It's my fault for fighting alone.

141
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,380
When I was kidnapped at Xindu's gate,

142
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,220
it's my fault for being clumsy

143
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,260
and delaying your takeover of Panyi.

144
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,140
Now you're stuck tending to me.

145
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,100
Enough.

146
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,980
No more self-pity.

147
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,450
Get on. I'll carry you back.

148
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,570
How dare I?

149
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,690
Stop talking. Get on.

150
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,060
Hold still.

151
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,020
The current you

152
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,900
is nothing like the one

153
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,500
who drove me out of Xindu.

154
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,810
Then let me speak my heart.

155
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,980
I no longer wish to marry today's you.

156
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,530
Back then, Liu Yan

157
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,020
looked down on me

158
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,650
for my meager dowry.

159
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,810
Later, when he learned Panyi was part of it,

160
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,100
he tried to force the marriage.

161
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,690
And you?

162
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,650
After taking my seal of Panyi,

163
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,170
you cast me out of Xindu.

164
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,740
How are you any different?

165
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,900
For women in this world,

166
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,530
marriage is a sacred matter.

167
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,410
Why must mine be so fraught with hardship?

168
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,810
Am I unworthy?

169
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,810
I'm telling you I won't marry.

170
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,620
My Lady,

171
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,140
you truly don't wish to marry Wei Shao?

172
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,780
Of course, I do.

173
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,980
But he must be the one to act.

174
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,050
Right now,

175
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,170
he's already seized Panyi.

176
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,140
What leverage do we have?

177
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,900
In war, the best strategy
is to conquer minds.

178
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,410
I want him to marry me of his own will.

179
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,330
I saw

180
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,980
that when Lord Wei escorted you back earlier,

181
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,050
he seemed quite unsettled.

192
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,900
In the future,

193
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,780
if she ever needs our help,

194
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,980
treat it as

195
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,170
the most urgent matter.

196
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,630
- Understood.
- Understood.

197
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,290
Lord Wei,

198
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,650

May my grandchildren

202
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,020
not fail yours.

Father...

208
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,500
Father!

209
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,500

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,780
Perform

212
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,330
the memorial rituals.

213
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,140
Rest in peace, Lord Qiao.

Rest in peace, Lord Qiao.

215
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,450
Rest in peace, Lord Qiao.

216
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,650
Ping,

217
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,140
if in this life,

218
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,570
I can earn people's love like Father did,

219
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,380
I'll have no regrets.

(Panyi, Wei State)

222
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,330
Listen up, everyone!

223
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,020
By our lord's order,

224
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,900
we're recruiting able-bodied men

225
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,780
to repair the city defenses.

226
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,770
Each worker gets one peck of grain

227
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,050
per day.

228
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,260
Interested? Sign up over there.

229
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,580
My stomach's acting up.

230
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,900
I can't go.

231
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,740
Sir,

232
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,810
do you have any sons?

233
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,930
Do you have any sons?

234
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,380
What did you say?

235
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,290
Do you have any sons?

236
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,410
Old man!

237
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,500
Dinner's ready!

238
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,980
Coming!

239
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,390
I told you not to move around.

240
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,230
You never listen!

241
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,810
- Scary.
- Just wait till we get home!

242
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,530
This feels familiar…

243
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,410
Too bad Panyi doesn't have

244
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,170
a second People's Wall

245
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,500
for our lord to knock down.

246
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,280
Enough talk.

247
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,240
Who's handling rations?
Who's taking the census?

248
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,980
Draw straws.

249
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,220
Come on.

250
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,490
My turn.

251
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,930
Fine, fine.

252
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,930
My boy, thank you in advance.

253
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,530
You'll get used to it.

254
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,620
Get lost.

255
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,650
Let's go.

256
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,220
Ugh, what terrible luck.

257
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,170
The people of Panyi knew

258
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,530
that Lord Qiao gifted this place

259
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,740
to his daughter as dowry.

260
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,290
Lord Wei, now that you hold the seal,

261
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,220
you must have her trust.

262
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,650
For Panyi's citizens,

263
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,410
serving their ruler

264
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,140
is only natural.

265
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,690
But something went wrong...

266
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,330
Young Master Liu

267
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,930
brought Miss Xiaoqiao here instead,

268
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,050
vowing to marry her.

269
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,290
However,

270
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,380
if Miss Xiaoqiao herself announces

271
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,100
the marriage alliance,

272
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
just one line,

273
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,330
then with the seal in hand,

274
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,450
you can rightfully claim Panyi.

275
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,690
You're an interesting mayor.

276
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,100
As the saying goes:

277
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,810
"Every land breeds its own kind."

278
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,220
You Yanzhou folk

279
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,940
are all cunning.

280
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,090
I'm wronged, Lord Wei.

281
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,980
My loyalty is genuine.

282
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,500
Mayor,

283
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,610
you may leave for now.

284
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,940
Then I'll take my leave.

285
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,570
Though Yang Feng is unreasonable,

286
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,290
his words aren't entirely wrong.

287
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,660
I believe

288
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,610
I can do this without her.

289
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,420
She's just a helpless woman.

290
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Why must you dwell on it, My Lord?

291
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,530
Won't you go see her?

292
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,500
Me? See her?

293
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,500
No way.

294
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,060
Xiaotao.

295
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,020
What do you want?

296
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,780
Lord Wei sent me

297
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,890
to deliver ointment to Miss Xiaoqiao

298
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,460
and invite her for a talk.

299
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,410
Here.

300
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,620
She won't see him.

301
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,130
Lord Wei has urgent matters

302
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,700
to discuss with Miss Xiaoqiao.

303
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,890
What urgent matters?

304
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,850
It's already past noon.

305
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,130
Miss Xiaoqiao is resting.

306
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,610
After all,

307
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,810
she burned her wrist

308
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,700
for stopping Liu Yan

309
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,980
and saving Wei people.

310
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,810
This water was just used

311
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,290
to clean her wounds.

312
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,340
What?

313
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,020
General Wei Duang,

314
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,420
you wouldn't disturb her, right?

315
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,530
You just can't stop calling me that, huh?

316
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,810
I'm Wei Liang!

317
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,980
We four brothers are

318
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,700
Wei Liang, Wei Qu, Wei Xiao, Wei...

319
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,180
I don't care which "Wei" you are.

320
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:46,890
Fine.

321
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,370
Miss Xiaoqiao deserves better than you.

322
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,660
I...

323
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,020
I'll return at noon tomorrow.

324
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,780
(Next day)

325
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,330
Please pass a word to Miss Xiaoqiao

326
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,630
Lord Wei requests a meeting.

327
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,180
A meeting or an accusation?

328
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,330
This looks

329
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,660
just like Liu Yan's case.

330
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,010
Step back.

331
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,860
Yes.

332
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,700
Now may I invite Miss Xiaoqiao?

333
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,850
She's taking a nap.

334
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,610
But it's barely noon.

335
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,890
Did she skip lunch to rest?

336
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,890
Her wounds are causing pain,

337
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,980
so she has no appetite

338
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,570
and went to bed early.

339
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,260
Please, General,

340
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,660
come earlier tomorrow.

341
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,740
(The following day)

342
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,090
Miss Xiaotao,

343
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,420
I picked fresh goods at the market.

344
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
Take a look.

345
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,460
For you, Xiaozao, and Chunniang.

346
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,940
And for Miss Xiaoqiao too.

347
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,500
Would you speak to her today?

348
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,370
Ask her to come out briefly.

349
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,450
Xiaotao,

350
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,660
taking the gifts and leaving?

351
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Where's Miss Xiaoqiao?

352
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,810
- She is asleep.
- Asleep.

353
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,530
Since you already know,

354
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,780
I won't keep you.

355
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,660
Wait, why today as well?

356
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,530
Her wounds pained her last night,

357
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,740
so she ate much

358
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,980
to ease the discomfort

359
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,290
and she couldn't sleep till dawn.

360
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,530
Yesterday you said no appetite,

361
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,980
now she's overeating?

362
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,130
Lord Wei gets to

363
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,850
expel then summon her back.

364
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,220
Why can't Miss Xiaoqiao

365
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,890
eat more despite no appetite?

366
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,330
This ailment, that ailment.

367
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,780
I say she's just spoiled.

368
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,260
Spoiled?

369
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,180
My Lord, did you spoil her?

370
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,020
He means a beating would fix it.

371
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,290
Should've said so earlier.

372
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,330
My Lord, here you go.

373
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,940
She's just a helpless woman

374
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,020
driven out of Xindu by our lord,

375
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,020
then threatened by Liu Yan,

376
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,910
and now injured for the people's sake.

377
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,180
It's only natural she'd feel wronged.

378
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,810
But think about it,

379
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,090
if our lord just apologizes properly,

380
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,290
wouldn't this be resolved? Right?

381
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,260
Right what?

382
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,500
Why should I apologize?

383
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,650
Exactly!

384
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,260
These are just the Qiao family's tricks.

385
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,290
Bring me the stick.

386
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,130
My Lord.

387
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,460
My Lord, where are you going?

388
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,460
I'll drag her out of that room myself.

389
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,780
Let's go.

390
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,860
Go.

391
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,610
You faked illness and complained.

392
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Who knows if it'll work on Lord Wei?

393
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,700
Will playing sick make him agree to marry?

394
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,330
He needs me.

395
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,940
How absurd!

396
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,020
He sent people to spy on us.

397
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,090
My Lady, hurry.

398
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,370
Lie down, lie down.

399
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,130
Put it away, quick.

400
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,850
Lie down, lie down.

401
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,260
Close your eyes, close them.

402
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,260
Feeling better now, My Lady?

403
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,210
My Lady.

404
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,980
Someone just left this at the door.

405
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,410
What is it?

406
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,260
It's my elder sister's belongings.

407
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,580
My Lord, My Lord.

408
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,780
My Lady, let's go.

409
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,050
We'll leave through the back.

410
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,700
She really was faking it.

411
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,810
Why are they

412
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,700
sneaking about?

413
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,690
Manman!

414
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,610
Fan.

415
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,890
I never imagined the consequence

416
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,780
of me fleeing the marriage

417
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,810
would be you taking my place.

418
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,660
You just didn't want me to suffer.

419
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,610
You didn't want me to marry Lord Wei.

420
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,940
Since you know my intentions,

421
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,890
why insist on coming here?

422
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,290
Aren't you throwing my efforts away?

423
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,940
If the Wei house is a den of wolves,

424
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,130
I can't let you face it alone.

425
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,420
That's why I had Bi Zhi bring me here.

426
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,700
Let's flee together.

427
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,050
Fan,

428
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,330
what if I insist on marrying Lord Wei?

429
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,700
Will you let me?

430
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,220
That Wei Shao

431
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,940
is ruthless and cruel.

432
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,740
He tortured Li Su mercilessly.

433
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,660
How could he treat you

434
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,050
any better?

435
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,890
Look how worn you've become.

436
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,530
That's because Liu Yan abducted me.

437
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,530
Wei Shao had nothing to do with it.

438
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,420
He's far better than Liu Yan.

439
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,130
He's our family's enemy.

440
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,500
How could you favor him?

441
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,420
You only know he killed Li Su,

442
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,090
not that he saved countless lives.

443
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,020
And besides…

444
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,980
And he...

445
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,820
he...

446
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,220
He's dashing and heroic.

447
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,050
The first time I saw him,

448
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,530
I was already smitten.

449
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,780
Qiao's silver tongue

450
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,130
outdoes even a strategist's tales.

451
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,700
Since when was she "smitten"?

452
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,090
Wait, Manman,

453
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,050
are you…

454
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,530
are you truly sincere?

455
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,370
Not just to let me be with Bi Zhi?

456
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,530
Who said I'd let you be with Bi Zhi?

457
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,500
If anything, I'm begging you,

458
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,940
let me be with Wei Shao.

459
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,740
If that's the case,

460
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,500
then I'll harden my heart

461
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,130
and leave with Bi Zhi.

462
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,890
Go.

463
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,780
Be happy with Bi Zhi.

464
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,890
Alright.

465
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,700
It's getting late today.

466
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,100
Well,

467
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,420
I'll have someone
find you a place to stay.

468
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,850
Wasn't Qiao Yue's daughter Jingxiang

469
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,050
reported missing?

470
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,180
Turns out she eloped with a servant.

471
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,740
I'll go arrest her.

472
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,580
Stop.

473
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,050
What does he mean?

474
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,530
Is he charmed by the Qiao sisters' beauty?

475
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,460
Or fooled by her sweet talk?

476
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,220
So Miss Xiaoqiao is marrying
in her sister's stead.

477
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,090
The Qiaos are mostly heartless people.

478
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,370
It's rare to see one like her.

479
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,330
How are the arrangements?

480
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,420
Don't worry, My Lady.

481
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,700
They're settled in a secluded side chamber.

482
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,500
Good.

483
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,660
My Lady, Lord Wei is here.

484
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,700
He wants to see you.

485
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,420
Were we exposed?

486
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,810
Don't panic yet.

487
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,740
Let's hear what he says.

488
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,050
Lord Wei,

489
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,370
what brings you here?

490
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,330
I heard you were ill.

491
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,850
You're suddenly

492
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,180
so concerned about my health.

493
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,460
Is there something to discuss?

494
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,290
Nothing urgent.

495
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,660
Just that Panyi's people miss you

496
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,600
and begged me to check on you.

497
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,940
No sugar-coating today, huh?

498
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,500
I miss them too,

499
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,020
but my health holds me back.

500
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,330
I caught a chill outside Xindu,

501
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,330
and my hand wound hasn't healed.

502
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,530
I don't have the strength

503
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,530
to go see them now.

504
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,090
Perhaps in a few more days.

505
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,500
A few days ago,

506
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,530
I drove you out of Xindu.

507
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,180
That was my mistake.

508
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,610
I shouldn't have imposed

509
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,780
my grudge on you.

510
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,810
Moreover,

511
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,330
you fought against Liu Yan

512
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,700
for Wei people

513
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,020
and got yourself wounded.

514
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,530
I ought to thank you

515
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,130
on their behalf.

516
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,290
Lord Wei,

517
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,090
don't force yourself.

518
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,610
Why apologize and thank me?

519
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,660
I held many prejudices against the Qiaos,

520
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,530
but today,

521
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,850
I see you're different.

522
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,460
You agreed to marry me

523
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,460
not for yourself,

524
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,610
but for the people...

525
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,090
and for your sister.

526
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,020
Since you're unwell,

527
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,660
avoid places like mountains.

528
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,290
The wind is harsh.

529
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,530
It could worsen your condition.

530
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,610
Even if you must meet your family,

531
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,610
be cautious.

532
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,890
You know I met my sister?

533
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,260
What will you do?

534
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,780
I don't quarrel with women.

535
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,660
Thank you, Lord Wei.

536
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,260
Take your medicine.

537
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,850
Hey, neighbors, please gather around.

538
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,090
Come closer.

539
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,330
Step forward.

540
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,890
Come on, move up front!

541
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,530
Miss Xiaoqiao has words for you all.

542
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,980
Please, quiet down.

543
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,090
Silence, everyone.

544
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,460
My Lady, go ahead.

545
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,450
Neighbors,

546
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,810
as you all know,

547
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,570
my grandfather broke his promise

548
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,810
to the late Lord Wei fourteen years ago,

549
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,260
leading to the Wei family dying in battle.

550
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
Xindu

551
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,050
was then slaughtered by Li Su.

552
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,390
The people built the People's Wall

553
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,740
with their loved ones' belongings

554
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,790
to remember the hatred.

555
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,810
Yet now, fourteen years later,

556
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
when Lord Wei retook Xindu,

557
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,980
he ordered this wall torn down. Why?

558
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,620
Yes, why?

559
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,330
Because

560
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,780
he is magnanimous

561
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,610
and cares for the people.

562
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,570
Lord Wei retook Xindu

563
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,740
not just for revenge,

564
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,050
but for a greater purpose.

565
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,700
What purpose?

566
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,050
My grandfather and the Late Lord Wei

567
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,020
built the Yongning Canal together.

568
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,780
Back then, farms flourished.

569
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,420
But after Li Su seized Xindu,

570
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,530
the canal silted up

571
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,610
and was abandoned.

572
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,290
Harvests halved,

573
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,020
and the people suffered.

574
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,020
This time, Lord Wei attacked Panyi

575
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,220
to restore the canal.

576
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,700
That's wonderful.

577
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,650
Yes.

578
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,740
A true blessing!

579
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,090
Now, with Yanzhou and Wei
united by marriage,

580
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,980
swords will turn to plowshares.

581
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
From this day on,

582
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,130
Panyi

583
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,050
is part of Wei.

584
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,290
All of us

585
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,850
are Lord Wei's people.

586
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,940
Yes, like one family! Well said!

587
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,980
The canal is for your benefit.

588
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,330
We ask for your full support,
people of Panyi.

589
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,780
Good! Well said!

590
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,370
Did you tell her about my canal project?

591
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,260
I wouldn't dare act without orders

592
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,420
and ruin your plans.

593
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,660
Then how did she know?

594
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,050
Lord Wei's actions

595
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,700
show he values you much.

596
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,460
To have such a lord

597
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,850
is Panyi's fortune.

598
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,180
May we stand united

599
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,610
with Lord Wei

600
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,810
to fulfill the vision!

601
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,890
Stand united, fulfill the vision!

602
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,330
- Stand united, fulfill the vision!
- Wei Shao crippled Liu Yan,

603
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,130
yet she handed over Panyi

604
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,130
without demands. I...

605
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,970
Stand united, fulfill the vision!

606
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:20,470
Stand united, fulfill the vision!

607
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,420
Stand united, fulfill the vision!

608
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,660
Tell me,

609
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,610
what do you think of me?

610
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,330
The world says

611
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,850
Lord Wei only conquers cities,

612
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,290
but in Xindu, I studied

613
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,660
the Panyi Annals you gave me.

614
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,660
I noticed the words Yongning Canal

615
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,050
were traced over repeatedly.

616
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,890
Later, reviewing the map of Wei,

617
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,890
I realized

618
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,460
your greatest effort these years

619
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,050
was for building canals.

620
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,940
Truly admirable.

621
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,180
I'll persuade my uncle

622
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,330
to mobilize Yanzhou's strength

623
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,610
in supporting you.

624
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,890
Are you using the canals

625
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,970
as bargaining leverage?

626
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:14,580
How could I?

627
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,890
This marriage pact

628
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,740
isn't Wei's promise to Yanzhou.

629
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,370
It's your vow to the people

630
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,330
of Wei and Yanzhou.

631
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,660
Do you know why

632
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,890
Bianzhou attacked Xindu

633
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,010
fourteen years ago?

634
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,450
Because my grandfather helped Wei

635
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,780
build the Yongning Canal.

636
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,140
(Qiao)
This map is confidential.

637
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,580
I made a copy for you.

638
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,270
(Liangya, Panyi, Wei State)
Don't let others see it.

639
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,140
Once the Yongning Canal is complete,

640
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,780
Yanzhou and Wei

641
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:56,290
will be bound like sworn allies.

642
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,370
Bianzhou won't sit idle.

643
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,740
They'll try to

644
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,060
sever this lifeline.

645
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,450
And Panyi

646
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,970
is the vital pass along this lifeline.

647
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,100
It's like...

648
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,330
a heart.

649
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,700
That day I handed you my seal,

650
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,970
it wasn't because I didn't understand.

651
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
It was out of remorse and sincerity

652
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,450
that I gave you my heart.

653
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,700
Heart? What heart?

654
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,580
The seal's with me now.

655
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,780
The city's been taken.

656
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,780
I won't give Panyi back to you.

657
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,890
That day, you took the seal

658
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,370
and drove me out of Xindu.

659
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,810
You betrayed me alone.

660
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,700
But now I've rallied Panyi's people

661
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,970
to help you dig the canal.

662
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,220
If you go back on your word again,

663
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,660
the ones you'll betray

664
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,970
are the people of Wei and Yanzhou.

665
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,430
The people of both states.

666
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,660
Lord Wei, how can you bear this?

667
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,260
I can't out-argue you,

668
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,330
but didn't you say

669
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,580
you wouldn't marry?

670
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,370
Lord Wei, you're magnanimous.

671
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,450
My humble heart yearns for you.

672
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,930
What is there to fret about?

673
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,930
None of the Qiaos are capable fighters.

674
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,540
Qiao Gui is critically ill,

675
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,180
and Qiao Ci isn't grown yet.

676
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,190
That leaves two,

677
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,260
one's a coward, and the other is worthless.

678
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,290
Even with ample supplies,

679
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,140
they've got troops but no commanders.

680
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,890
They'd surrender Panyi,

681
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,370
such a crucial stronghold.

682
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,970
Clearly, they're terrified.

683
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,290
Are they?

684
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,540
They just fear our lord might

685
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,450
banish Lady Qiao again.

686
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,660
Would that sound honorable?

687
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,410
Since when has our lord

688
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,370
cared about honor?

689
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,100
Then banish her.

690
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,620
Expel her from Panyi

691
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,970
like what we did in Xindu

692
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,810
last time.

693
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,770
But who knows if some Wang Yan

694
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,010
or Zhang Yan will be waiting outside Panyi

695
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,220
to plunder her dowry?

696
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,010
Mr. Gongsun,

697
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,100
say something?

698
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,270
I dare not bring shame upon you.

699
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,870
Please

700
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,850
make your own decision.

701
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,200
Who knows when we'll meet again

702
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,700
after you leave this time.

703
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,220
Find a place to settle down quickly,

704
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,780
so we can still exchange letters.

705
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,970
Once I find a place to call home,

706
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,180
I'll surely let you know.

707
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,980
Good.

708
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,140
You've never suffered like this before.

709
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,370
If you

710
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,700
must blame someone,

711
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,490
blame our family's lack of warriors.

712
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,580
Whoa.

713
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,850
Fan, My Lady,

714
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,140
a boulder blocks the path ahead.

715
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,190
Rest a while,

716
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,270
I'll move it aside.

717
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,170
Let's go.

718
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,290
We heard

719
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,180
you were exiled from Xindu by Lord Wei,

720
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,810
so we came after you.

721
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,140
On the way,

722
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,970
we encountered Lord Wei's troops

723
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,310
and fought them.

724
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,580
Later, in Panyi,

725
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:40,140
I clashed with Liu Yan's forces too.

726
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,850
A three-way battle.

727
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,960
You moved through them

728
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,330
like they weren't even there.

729
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,090
He does possess some brute strength.

730
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,620
We're tired from the journey.

731
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,810
Bi Zhi, please go find us some food.

732
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,140
That's easy enough.

733
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,020
Fan,

734
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,060
I have something important to tell you.

735
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,410
This concerns Yanzhou's survival.

736
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,140
You must do your utmost.

737
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,780
At the border where Yanzhou,

738
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,140
Wei, and Bianzhou meet,

739
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,450
there's a county

740
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,580
called Boya.

741
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,490
To sue for peace,

742
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,700
Yanzhou gave up its heart.

743
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,660
Now that Panyi is in Wei Shao's hands,

744
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,160
we've lost the advantage.

745
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,850
We must secure a backup plan

746
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,700
and hold this strategic location.

747
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,260
Our repeated retreats happened

748
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,060
because we had troops but no leaders,

749
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,180
no capable fighters.

750
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,660
With Bi Zhi here,

751
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,700
I believe we can hold it.

752
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,290
Manman says we should go to Boya.

753
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,700
Then we go to Boya.

754
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,030
What kind of place is it?

755
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,660
A county.

756
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,740
It's a good land, near mountains, with mines.

757
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,890
It's also bad.

758
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,970
Everyone wants to take it,

759
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,890
but none dare make the first move.

760
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,780
I don't expect glory from you,

761
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,330
just your safety.

762
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,330
Bi Zhi,

763
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,180
let's just be

764
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,540
a happy ordinary couple, alright?

765
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,810
Alright.

766
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,540
Hyah!

767
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,620
You parted with your sister,

768
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,970
yet you seem unshaken.

769
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,330
My lady has fulfilled a wish,

770
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,620
so she's delightful.

771
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,850
What wish?

772
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,490
Our Qiao family finally has a true warrior.

773
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,370
That Bi Zhi

774
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,580
was born with godlike strength.

775
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,260
What a fine match!

776
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,490
But what of my lady's marriage?

777
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,370
A full day has passed.

778
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,370
Why no word from Lord Wei?

779
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,970
It takes time.

780
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,100
Haste makes waste.

781
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,500
My Lady.

782
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,580
My Lady.

783
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,220
You're missing for a whole day.

784
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,820
Turns out you're here for tea?

785
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,220
You already gave away a city.

786
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,100
Now you promise to build canals?

787
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,700
Patience.

788
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,700
Sit.

789
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,620
I...

790
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,810
We seek an alliance with Wei.

791
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,580
Shouldn't we show sincerity?

792
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,620
And let them keep nibbling at us?

793
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,140
These canals will solve Wei's drought.

794
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,180
Won't that make Lord Wei unstoppable?

795
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,490
You're right.

796
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,970
If this succeeds,

797
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,100
Wei will grow even stronger.

798
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,370
The greater the threat Yanzhou faces.

799
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,370
But these are long-term pros and cons.

800
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,620
For now,

801
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,330
if this succeeds,

802
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,490
the benefits outweigh the risks.

803
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,690
And where do these benefits come from?

804
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,260
Wei Shao's canal project is inevitable.

805
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,100
Even if I refuse,

806
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,450
he'll conduct it anyway.

807
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,740
Secondly, while building the canal,

808
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,740
he'll deploy considerable troops,

809
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,700
leaving no resources to attack Yanzhou.

810
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,620
This gives us

811
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,180
a breathing space.

812
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,180
I'll use this marriage

813
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,450
to turn the tide.

814
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,700
But now it seems

815
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,780
this marriage

816
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,810
may not happen after all.

817
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,890
What do you mean?

818
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,370
Lord Qiao Gui...

819
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,290
has passed away.

820
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,010
I came specifically to deliver this news.

821
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,980
Wait,

822
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,930
this is no joking matter.

823
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,980
(Qiao Gui, Governor of Yanzhou,)

824
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,180
(passed peacefully on April 13th, aged 60.)

825
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,620
When did this happen?

826
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,580
Today.

827
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,930
It happens to be

828
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,260
his fifth-week memorial.

829
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:44,100
(Qiao Gui, Governor of Yanzhou)

830
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,900
My Lady,

831
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,850
building canals

832
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,260
is no small matter.

833
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,290
You can't just act on impulse alone.

834
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,460
(Qiao Gui, Governor of Yanzhou)

835
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,370
My Lady, are you alright?

836
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
(passed peacefully on April 13th, aged 60.)

837
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,580
