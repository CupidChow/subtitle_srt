30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,970
Out of fear that the truth
would come out,

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,460
Liu Yan ordered a siege.

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,290
We couldn't hold them off.

33
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,260
General Wei Liang fought to
get me out of there,

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
but he...

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,660
He...

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,380
I...

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,320
It should've been me.

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,130
Qiao Ci,

39
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,500
look at me.

40
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,690
Wei Liang went to fetch you, right?

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,380
Where is he now?

42
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,130
Look at me.

43
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,980
Where is Wei Liang?

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,170
He went to Yujun.

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,260
Answer me. Where is he now?

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,780
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,570
Where is Wei Liang?

48
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,660
Where is he?

49
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,940
It should've been you.

50
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,240
Why did it have to be him?

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,380
Why not a Qiao?

52
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,220
Wei Xiao!

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,290
My Lord!

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,180
Reporting!

55
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,660
Liu Yan has taken Panyi with his troops.

56
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,060
Pass down my orders:

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,380
All troops, stay on alert.

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,260
Tomorrow,

59
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,170
we march on Panyi!

60
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,530
Yes.

61
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,690
My Lord.

62
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,380
My Lord, My Lord.

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,450
Let me lead a team to bring him back.

64
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,130
I asked Wei Liang to go. He'll be fine.

65
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,060
He just didn't see him.

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,260
- Wei Qu.
- I'll get him back.

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,290
Wei Qu, calm down!

68
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,130
Wei Qu!

69
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,170
Let me bring him back!

70
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,250
Get up.

71
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,530
Get up.

72
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,220
My Lord, let me bring him back.

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,060
Get up.

74
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,410
Wei Liang will be okay.

75
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,170
I'll go now. I'll bring him back!

76
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,170
Wei Qu, hear my command.

77
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,660
Tomorrow, take a cavalry unit

78
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,530
to Kangjun.

79
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,850
Find Qiao Ping.

80
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,780
Bring

81
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,660
Wei Liang back.

82
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,850
I will bring him back.

83
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,380
Yes, My Lord.

84
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,420
- My Lady.
- Manman. Manman.

85
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,260
- My Lady.
- Manman.

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,940
- Manman.
- My Lady.

87
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,850
Lie down.

88
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,060
My Lord.

89
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,610
Don't blame yourself.

90
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,660
I just hate

91
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,660
that I can't take this pain for you.

92
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,340
You grew up with Wei Liang.

93
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,850
You weren't real brothers,

94
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,810
but he was like a real brother to you.

95
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,370
Now, he was killed because of my family.

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,370
Even if we paid with our lives,

97
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,900
it wouldn't ease your pain.

98
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,020
I once promised you
that I'd give you more kids

99
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,930
and restore the past glory.

100
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,900
But now I've made you lose Wei Liang.

101
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,220
And Xiaotao...

102
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,730
She's still...

103
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,610
She's still waiting for Wei Liang.

104
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,410
This isn't your fault.

105
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,220
You've tried to balance both clans.

106
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,410
It's been exhausting.

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,610
Besides,

108
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,170
Qiao Yue and Liu Yan

109
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,250
did this.

110
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,850
You had nothing to do with it.

111
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,460
I will never blame you

112
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,250
for this.

113
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,660
But from now on,

114
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,100
I may...

115
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,980
I understand.

116
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,730
Whether it's to avenge Wei Liang,

117
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,460
take back Panyi for the people,

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,340
seek justice for General Wei Liang,

119
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,730
or punish my uncle's betrayal,

120
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,250
you must go to war at once.

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
Don't worry.

122
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,580
I don't blame you.

123
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,410
Thank you, Manman.

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,490
You've never failed me,

125
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,810
and I will never fail you.

126
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,020
I promise.

127
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,340
This matter

128
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,410
will not implicate others.

129
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
I give you my word.

130
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,140
After I leave,

131
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,290
take care of this family for me.

132
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,020
Take care of yourself

133
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,540
and Feifei.

134
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,410
I may not be back

135
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,170
in time for Feifei's birth.

136
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,930
That's okay.

137
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,220
This time,

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,340
I won't see you off.

139
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,460
Be careful on your journey.

140
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,130
Don't worry.

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,620
(Yujun)

142
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
My Lord, don't worry.

143
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,480
Wei Xiao and I will protect Yujun.

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,530
We'll patrol day and night.

145
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,730
Nothing will happen.

146
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,460
Lady Xu and Lady Zhu
will take care of the Lady.

147
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,730
You have nothing to worry about.

148
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
Good.

149
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,100
- Depart!
- Yes!

150
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,060
Hyah!

151
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,850
My Lady, take care of yourself.

152
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't strain yourself or harm the baby.

153
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,300
How's Xiaotao?

154
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,010
Xiaotao...

155
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,100
You're really going to Yanzhou?

156
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,820
I'll go and pick a real Yanzhou orchid

157
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,490
to marry you.

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,770
Are you asking me to serve you?

159
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,610
No need for that.

160
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,100
Just marry me.

161
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,730
Once I've saved enough wages,

162
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,660
I'll have the Lord ask

163
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,260
for your mother's approval on my behalf.

164
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,820
He values you.

165
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,130
He's afraid he's not worthy of you,

166
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,730
so he wants to do more.

167
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,490
Only then will he feel at ease.

168
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,820
You...

169
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,980
Come back safe, okay?

170
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,490
I've got your safety charm.

171
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,400
Even if I get injured,

172
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,460
I'll come back and ask
for your mother's approval.

173
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,420
Pah, pah, pah.

174
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,850
You won't get injured.

175
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,820
Mine is a little gold dart.

176
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,730
Every time we head to battle,

177
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,730
we leave these little weapons behind.

178
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,980
I want to give this to you.

179
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Seeing it

180
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,300
will be like seeing me.

181
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,020
Before General Wei Liang died,

182
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,100
he asked me

183
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,010
to bring this orchid to you.

184
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,940
He must not have wanted you
to grieve like this.

185
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,210
He said

186
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,770
he'd bring the orchid

187
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,980
and propose to me.

188
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,530
Tell Xiaotao

189
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,700
not to wait for me!

190
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,490
This is from him.

191
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,700
My mother said

192
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,610
he was afraid I'd suffer

193
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,180
and I'd look down on him one day

194
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,530
so he made the betrothal gifts
so complex.

195
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,420
She asked me to let him.

196
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,650
She said it was more festive.

197
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,220
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

198
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,850
Lord Yang.

199
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,370
What's the situation in the city?

200
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,860
The defenses are weak.

201
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,100
We can't hold against Liangya.

202
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,300
Panyi has completely fallen

203
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,420
into Liu Yan's hands.

204
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,400
Lord Yang,

205
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,370
we once helped Lord Qiao
knock at the gate.

206
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,010
So now...

207
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:27,880
Should we have

208
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,460
to turn to Liangya now?

209
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,700
Listen.

210
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,140
(Zhongzhou has defected)

211
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,490
Lady Yulou has swayed Zhongzhou,

212
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,530
dealing a major blow to Wei.

213
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,980
Now, Wei Shao's allies
are turning to me.

214
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
I wonder how he defies me now.

215
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,730
But the Wei cavalry is still strong.

216
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,730
Even without allies,
they're hard to defeat.

217
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,470
Last time at Panyi,

218
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,700
Liangya lost to them.

219
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,850
Things are different now.

220
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,770
Wei Shao must pass this way

221
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,370
(Yongning City)
to reach us.

222
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,530
Yongning City?

223
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,650
He once built a dam here

224
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,940
to divert floods.

225
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,480
If the upper course breaks
and the lower course is blocked,

226
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,060
what do you think will happen

227
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
when he passes through?

228
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,730
Brilliant.

229
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,490
If it works,

230
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,220
this place will become Wei Shao's grave.

231
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,010
That day,

232
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,490
Lady Qiao scared off my reinforcements.

233
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,100
Today, I shall return that disgrace

234
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,010
in full.

235
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,210
Who's there?

236
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,850
Come in.

237
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,250
I'm here to deliver a report.

238
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,220
The Wei army is on the move.

239
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,610
My Lords,

240
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,100
(Zhongzhou has defected)
what to do?

241
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,220
Just as expected.

242
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,490
Lord Yang, guard the Panyi dam.

243
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,130
Be ready to release the water.

244
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,100
Yes. I'll prepare to open the gate.

245
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,180
Not to open it.

246
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,100
Destroy it.

247
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,010
Destroy the dam?

248
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,890
That can't be.

249
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,420
I've observed the clouds.

250
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,890
Heavy rains are coming.

251
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,650
If we break the dam now,

252
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,770
the flood downstream
will be catastrophic.

253
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,060
If the rain intensifies,

254
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,180
the people will be doomed.

255
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,730
The Lord of Wei...

256
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,770
Wei Shao deserves it,
but the people along the way

257
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,530
are innocent.

258
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,730
To achieve greatness,
one can't fuss over trifles.

259
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,420
Lord Yang, my late father trusted you.

260
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,650
Surely you understand that.

261
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,850
You call this a trifle?

262
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,210
Fine.

263
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I understand.

264
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,100
Governor, My Lord,

265
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,180
I'll do as you command.

266
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,180
But the dam of the Yongning Canal

267
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,460
is made of giant stones.

268
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,820
It's hard to destroy.

269
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,180
If we use sulfur as an explosive,

270
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,300
it must be placed

271
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,100
beneath the load-bearing wooden beams.

272
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,250
Without the right method,

273
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,700
it won't work.

274
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,610
My Lord,

275
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,380
he makes a point.

276
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,770
Then please wait here.

277
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,980
I'll fetch the engineering diagram.

278
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,140
With that, it'll be more effective.

279
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,490
Very well.

280
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,730
Be quick.

281
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:18,930
Yes.

282
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,330
The Yongning Canal project
is very complex,

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,810
especially the section
from Panyi to Xindu.

284
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,770
It took years to build.

285
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,810
Now,

286
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,810
it links two major rivers.

287
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,730
I can't even tell if we're standing

288
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,980
above the Yang River

289
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,490
or the Pei River.

290
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,050
Lord Yang,
you took Wei's salary for years.

291
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,160
Do you see yourself as from Yanzhou

292
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,570
or Wei?

293
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,090
Does it matter?

294
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,490
Lord Qiao devoted years to this dam

295
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,700
to unify the land.

296
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,460
He hoped

297
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,500
for good traffic and trade

298
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,140
so the people no longer needed
to travel long

299
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
for water, food, and minerals.

300
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,140
I've seen

301
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,730
that same ambition

302
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,940
not only in Lord Qiao

303
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,110
but in the Lord of Wei, too.

304
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,420
They say you built canals in Panyi

305
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,290
and even in Rongjun.

306
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,940
Panyi wasn't always

307
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,700
a water town.

308
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,570
It used to be a flood zone.

309
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,140
Thanks to Lord Qiao's water management,
it became what it is today.

310
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,420
I just followed him around,

311
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,490
digging trenches.

312
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,810
That's how I gained a little experience

313
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,180
to fight back against the floods
of the Yang River.

314
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,860
That must've been hard.

315
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,050
When this is over,

316
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,220
you'll be rewarded.

317
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,330
I'm just

318
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,730
following orders.

319
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,250
There's no hardship in that.

320
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,010
But today,

321
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,660
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

322
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,620
Father built the canal for Yanzhou.

323
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,490
Destroying it now

324
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,420
is to eliminate a threat to Yanzhou.

325
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,290
You won't fail him.

326
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,420
Hurry and unroll the diagram.

327
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,620
Let's get started.

328
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,060
Sure.

329
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,380
An assassin!

330
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,570
Someone help!

331
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,250
Don't move!

332
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,570
What are you doing?

333
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,770
I couldn't kill Liu Yan,

334
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,570
but I can kill you!

335
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,420
However,

336
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,900
I'll have to fail Lord Qiao.

337
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,730
Yang Feng, are you insane?

338
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,770
How can you live after killing me?

339
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,530
Without the dam

340
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,900
and Panyi,

341
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,730
what's the point

342
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,380
of surviving alone?

343
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,090
Let him go.

344
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,940
I'll spare your life.

345
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,490
If Zhen Zhi could die for the cause,

346
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,490
so can I.

347
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,840
My Lord,

348
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,980
don't push him.

349
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,610
Fine.

350
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,770
I'm sorry, Lord Qiao.

351
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

352
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,700
You...

353
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,090
My Lord...

354
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,330
Even a minor mayor dared defy me?

355
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,220
Wei Shao,

356
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,570
I'll kill you myself.

357
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,500
(Hydraulic Engineering Diagram)

358
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,980
Don't worry too much

359
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,900
about Qiao and Liu.

360
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
It had nothing to do

361
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,140
with you or Ci.

362
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,620
Zhonglin will handle it.

363
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,660
Has your appetite

364
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,140
become better?

365
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,490
Yes.

366
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,810
My Lady.

367
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,090
My Lady.

368
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,700
My Lady.

369
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,050
General Wei Xiao requests an audience.

370
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,140
Let him in.

371
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,980
Yes.

372
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,050
My Ladies,

373
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,090
news from the border.

374
00:21:59,090 --> 00:21:59,960
Su Ehuang and Xue Tai

375
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,180
are leading the Zhongzhou army

376
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,020
to attack Yujun.

377
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,770
Zhongzhou has defected too?

378
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,330
How many troops are in Yujun now?

379
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,460
My Lady,

380
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,570
our troops

381
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,490
are fewer than 60,000.

382
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,290
Besides the border garrisons,

383
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,010
the Lord also left 5,000 each

384
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,220
in Yunzhong and Rongjun.

385
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,980
Grandmother,

386
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,980
I believe we should dispatch couriers

387
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,600
to warn the Lord,

388
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,900
so he'll be more careful.

389
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,210
They can also alert the border generals

390
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,530
to support one another

391
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,290
in case they're attacked.

392
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,400
Approved.

393
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:32,730
Let's do as you suggest.

394
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,810
Though the enemy comes strong,

395
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,430
the men of the Wei Clan

396
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,650
are battle-tested.

397
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,290
Heaven favors Wei.

398
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,700
We will overcome this.

399
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,730
General, please wait.

401
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,820
Grandmother,

402
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,050
Yujun is in grave danger.

403
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,730
We should post a notice
to call on the people

404
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,490
to defend Yujun with us.

405
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,620
Anyone who volunteers

406
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,490
can get armor and weapons in the office.

407
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
Also, we should open the gates

408
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,290
for two days

409
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,530
to let those who wish to go

410
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,140
leave Yujun.

411
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,860
When peace returns,

412
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,010
they can come back.

413
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,370
The Wei Clan

414
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,090
always puts the people first.

415
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,130
Do as you say.

416
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,180
- General Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

417
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,420
Escort Lady Zhu and the Lady

418
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,010
out of the city.

419
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,290
- Be quick.
- Yes.

420
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,130
Grandmother,

421
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,900
I can't leave.

422
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,700
I must stay in Yujun.

423
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,490
Before the Lord left,

424
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,730
I promised him

425
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,780
that...

426
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,770
- Lady Qiao.
- She's about to give birth.

427
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,620
Summon the physician!

428
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,730
Hurry!

429
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,250
Breathe. Breathe.

430
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,130
Hurry!

431
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,770
My Lady, please wait outside.

432
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,980
My Lady.

433
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,380
My Lady, push!

434
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,330
Come on, wipe her sweat.

435
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,700
Don't panic, My Lady.

436
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,770
Just relax.

437
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,770
Inhale. Push.

438
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,330
My Lady.

439
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,770
Don't panic. Hurry.

440
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,860
Relax.

441
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,330
Whoa.

442
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,370
Watch out!

443
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,930
Watch out!

444
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,700
- Inhale.
- Inhale.

445
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,820
Exhale.

446
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,570
Not yet.

447
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,460
Push again.

448
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,300
Exhale.

449
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,460
- Push!
- Push!

450
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,250
Push!

451
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,290
Push, My Lady!

452
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,250
Push!

453
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,980
Bear with it.

454
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,730
Come on, one, two.

455
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,140
Push!

456
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,620
Hurry!

457
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,810
Lift!

458
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,840
We can see the head.

459
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,860
We can see the head.

460
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,700
Push!

461
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,220
The baby is here!

462
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,390
The baby is here!

463
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,330
The baby is here!

464
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,010
- The baby is here.
- It's born.

465
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,250
Alright.

466
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,010
Congratulations, My Lady.

467
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,250
You have a child now.

468
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,740
My Lady,

469
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,900
look.

470
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,860
It's a little girl.

471
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,620
Feifei.

472
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,290
This is wonderful.

473
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,330
Wonderful.

474
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,530
Both of you are safe.

475
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,380
Mother.

476
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,250
Thank you.

477
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,770
She looks adorable.

478
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,610
How are you?

479
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:01,770
It must've been so hard.

480
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,980
Not at all.

481
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,010
You're soaked in sweat.

482
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,010
Report!

483
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,460
Yunzhong, Rongjun,
and Hanjun have fallen.

484
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,330
A force of 100,000 is marching on Yujun.

485
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,570
What do we do?

486
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,470
My Lady!

487
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,560
- What to do?
- Pack now.

488
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,010
Let's bring the Lady back to Yanzhou.

489
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,530
- What should we do?
- What to do?

490
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,370
Where do we go?

491
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,770
- What should we do?
- What to do?

492
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,630
Where can we go?

493
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,530
Stop panicking.

494
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,420
Grandmother,

495
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,860
the Lord left 60,000 men here.

496
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,420
How many troops does he have?

497
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,980
Building the Yongning Canal

498
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,220
cost Wei dearly.

499
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,330
We don't have many left.

500
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,700
How is he

501
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,420
supposed to fight?

502
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,570
What to do?

503
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,180
Good child.

504
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,420
Since Zhonglin has arranged it,

505
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,590
he must have a plan to win.

506
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,570
Get some rest.

507
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,140
I'll arrange for guards

508
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,570
to escort you

509
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,490
and Lady Zhu out.

510
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,980
I can't leave.

511
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,980
Grandmother.

512
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,940
Before the Lord left,

513
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,940
I promised him

514
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,420
to take care of everything at home

515
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,620
with no mistakes.

516
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,010
Grandmother, you are my family.

517
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,900
Yujun is my home.

518
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,140
I am the Lady of Wei.

519
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,250
I will stand with the people of Yujun.

520
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,730
I won't leave either.

521
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,330
Stop making more trouble.

522
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,090
In my whole life,

523
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
I've only wanted

524
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,180
to make you happy,

525
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,900
but I'm foolish

526
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,290
and often fail.

527
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,380
If you can see me differently

528
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,730
when I choose to stay,

529
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,570
then I won't leave.

530
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,570
Yes.

531
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,860
Though I'm

532
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,730
afraid of death,

533
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,290
my sons

534
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,010
and my husband

535
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,530
would never be deserters.

536
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,980
I will never

537
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,250
shame them

538
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,860
because of me.

539
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,850
Mother,

540
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,570
please let me stay.

541
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,140
I beg you.

542
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,170
Look.

543
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,980
These are

544
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,660
the Ladies of Wei.

545
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,380
She's smiling.

546
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,180
My Lord,

547
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,380
just as expected,

548
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,810
Liu Yan took Panyi

549
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,880
and destroyed the dam.

550
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,810
The Yang River broke free,
flooding everything.

551
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,620
He wants to trap us here

552
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,810
to miss our chance.

553
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,490
Anything else?

554
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,570
The couriers report

555
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,700
that Lord Zhen and Lord Yang
died for the cause.

556
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,940
Qiao Yue is dead.

557
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,460
How many of our men are left?

558
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,700
Fewer than 70%.

559
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,740
(Yujun)

560
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,090
(Panyi)

561
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,460
We can't delay anymore.

562
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,570
We must hurry to Panyi

563
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,910
and retake the Yongning Canal.

564
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,330
Report!

565
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,700
My Lord,

566
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,340
Lady Yulou and General Xue Tai

567
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,140
are leading 100,000 troops
to besiege Yujun.

568
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,590
They'll break through the gates soon.

569
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,900
Please come back to defend.

570
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,460
My Lord,

571
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,660
Lady Xu, Lady Zhu, and the Lady

572
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,980
are still in Yujun.

573
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,490
If the enemy breaches the city,

574
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,700
their lives will be at risk.

575
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,940
Fifteen years ago in Xindu,

576
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,700
the Wei Clan lost three generations.

577
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Must we face

578
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,490
the same today?

579
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,650
My Lord,

580
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,330
shall we march on Panyi

581
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,490
or fall back to defend Yujun?

582
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,220
Grandfather wants to keep
the people of Yanzhou

583
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,860
out of this war.

584
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,730
Whether to fail one person

585
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,460
or fail the people...

586
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,460
If it were me,
I wouldn't know how to choose either.

587
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,100
(Panyi)

588
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,930
Pass on my orders:

589
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,570
Let's march on Panyi

590
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,560
and retake the Yongning Canal.

591
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,660
Yes.

592
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,770
(Government Office)
Those seeking shelter

593
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,010
with nowhere else to go,

594
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,140
regardless of age,

595
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,420
may take refuge in the hall.

596
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,900
My Lady,

597
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,570
I want to enlist.

598
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,460
The enemy

599
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,330
is at our doorstep.

600
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,290
Though I am a woman,

601
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,980
I refuse to be bullied.

602
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,660
- I want to protect my home.
- Yes.

603
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,140
I once followed the late lord

604
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,570
to fight across the land.

605
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,730
Now the enemy's children
have reached our homes.

606
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,610
Yes.

607
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,770
We must show them

608
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,250
the power of Wei.

609
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,530
- Yes.
- Drive the enemy away!

610
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,510
Defend Wei!

611
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,700
Drive the enemy away! Defend Wei!

612
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,010
I know you want to protect our home.

613
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,100
Thank you all.

614
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,980
Count us in.

615
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,420
Count us in.

616
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,180
We may fail

617
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,900
in the battle today.

618
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,620
But we stand here

619
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,220
to tell everyone

620
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,730
the Wei Clan
hasn't betrayed the Wei State

621
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,900
and never will.

622
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,300
Yes.

623
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,860
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

624
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,490
the Wei State stands.

625
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,060
As long as the Wei Clan stands,

626
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,220
the Wei State stands.

627
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,770
The Wei Clan

628
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,860
will stand with you.

629
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,050
Defend Yujun!

630
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,700
Protect the Wei State!

631
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:37,010
Defend Yujun! Protect the Wei State!

632
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,220
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

633
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,620
Cheers! Come on!

634
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,570
We're on duty. Drink less.

635
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,210
What's there to fear?

636
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,050
The battle is at Panyi.

637
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,300
Who'd come here?

638
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,090
Cheers!

639
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,370
Come on!

640
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,580
If you go to Kangjun,

641
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,370
you can bring back
the Lord's father-in-law

642
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,370
and pick up an orchid on the way.

643
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,130
Then you can marry Xiaotao
when you're back.

644
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,420
Come on.

645
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,010
Let me fill your bowl.

646
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,090
Your face wasn't harmed.

647
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,130
We're not staying here.

648
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,570
I'm here to get you, Liang.

649
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,610
I'm bringing you home.

650
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,380
Aren't you Wei's greatest warrior?

651
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,900
Why did you die here?

652
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,490
How could you die here?

653
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,530
Come on, come with me.

654
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,090
I won't draw
grass straws anymore, Liang.

655
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,860
I won't.

656
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,610
Get up. Come home with me.

657
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,980
Get up!

658
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,900
Get up. I can't carry you.

659
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,460
We won't draw grass straws anymore.

660
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,090
Xiaotao's waiting to marry you.

661
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,860
Liang, let's go home.

662
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,820
Let's go.

663
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,010
You must be cold.

664
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,850
Liang,

665
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,010
we're not staying here.

666
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,690
I'll bring you home.

667
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,940
(Kangjun Wharf)

668
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,380
(Wei)

669
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,620
(Wei)

670
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,460
The Wei Clan

671
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,460
still has to fight for the Qiao Clan.

672
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,090
The Lord sent me to rescue a Qiao.

673
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,900
Come with me.

674
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,050
Enemy! Reinforce the defense!

675
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:20,890
Yes.

676
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,010
Liang.

677
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,210
Liang.

678
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,090
I lost an arm.

679
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,170
Go to Kangjun

680
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,490
and bring

681
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:17,850
Wei Liang back.

682
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,010
Who's there?

683
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,940
Wei Qu, General of Wei.

684
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,170
I'm here to rescue you.

685
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,690
Thanks, General Wei.

686
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,340
Can you see anything?

687
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,210
Though I can't see,

688
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,900
I still have some basic fighting skills.

689
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,090
I won't hold you back.

690
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,170
Just give me

691
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,420
some instructions, General.

692
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,530
Hold on to me tight.

693
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,300
General,

694
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,460
who's on your back?

695
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,820
Wei Liang, General of Wei.

696
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,570
You two,

697
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,260
I suggest you surrender.

698
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,460
This is Yanzhou.

699
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,090
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

700
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,820
Soldiers, you might not know,

701
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,010
but your governor

702
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,210
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

703
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,690
Liangya is hiding this

704
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,420
to divide Yanzhou later.

705
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,900
My brother is dead?

706
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,690
Qiao Yue is dead.

707
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,420
So, the prefect is

708
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,490
the governor now.

709
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,650
Are you sure

710
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,820
you want to fight him now?

711
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Don't listen to him.

712
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,260
Seize these two immediately.

713
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,980
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

714
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,540
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

715
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,480
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

716
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,340
let alone you.

717
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,090
- Well.
- Think carefully.

718
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,340
Will you listen to a Liangya man

719
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,300
or your prefect?
