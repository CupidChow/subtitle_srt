1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There was a funeral in the capital.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fourteen years ago,

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
thousands of people buried their bones here.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't worry about it.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you don't have any sincerity,

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you can go back to your home

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and send them back.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But this wedding

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is my grandmother's wish.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So,

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
if you have sincerity,

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you must get married in Pan Yi.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiao Tan.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Give her the gift I prepared for the bridegroom.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Girl.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In my opinion,

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Marquis Wei is loyal to you.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How about we listen to their arrangement

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and hand over Pan Yi

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and marry him as soon as possible?

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The gift is not for me.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's threatening me.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He has been planning for a long time.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if I don't give it to him,

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
he will definitely fight it himself.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So,

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
it's no big deal to hand over Pan Yi.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Marquis Wei

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
won't be able to do anything.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why?

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The grudge between our families

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
is because of Chu Erfan.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you want to break this rule,

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you have to find his shortcomings

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and know what he wants.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How is Wei Shao?

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He is

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
narrow-minded

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and cruel.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me tell you.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He is different from his family.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You must be careful when you talk to him.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't worry, mom.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Which way are you going?

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I didn't see anything.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why does he smell like a doctor?

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not my smell.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not a doctor.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's the smell of the box.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the smell of the box.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's the etiquette.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Nonsense.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The etiquette is big.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It can fit in the box.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The etiquette didn't believe it at first.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Until he saw his hands and feet

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
being cut off

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and put in the box.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He believed it.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me show you.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are out here

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and don't know the rules.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Please forgive us.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Listen.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Our master

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is not a good master.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He doesn't want to be like Li Su.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He just knows the rules.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This little fat girl is so annoying.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Li Su killed his family

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
for three generations

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and he killed the new capital.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No matter what he got,

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
he is not worth it.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We don't know how his chest is.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We need to see how he treats the people.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He doesn't treat the people well.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I heard someone say he...

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Master has orders.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
From today on,

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you can't have anything

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that makes a mess here.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you don't have orders,

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you can't have anything.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He doesn't even allow you to pray.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What about the people around him?

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He is suspicious.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I heard that the Marquis would kill people in his dreams.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He never let anyone else come near him when he was asleep.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think he is afraid that someone will kill him.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who is it?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm Wei Xiang.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Master, the house is on fire.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The house is on fire.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you need any light?

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Come here.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Are you stupid?

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You don't want others to know

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that the master is sleeping at night.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Master said

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
we don't know about this.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's hard for the master.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He is locked in a small wooden box.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If he were to be given to me,

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
he would be afraid of the darkness

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and even the wood.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Say something.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You can't even fight with three pounds.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's talk louder.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The master won't be afraid.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
He is playing the zither to the cattle.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Master.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Master.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Master.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Master.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Master.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You haven't even finished your breathing?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Master.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The people of Xin Du have been poisoned by the rites for many years.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They are still in the coffin.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They need to be patient.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is this?

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
People say that this is the altar.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a bit high, but it can cover the whole of Xin Du.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Unfortunately, it's now destroyed.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's go up and have a look.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Your Majesty.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The altar has been renovated for many years.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to be careful when you go up there.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We can't call you Your Majesty yet.

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Our bridegroom and the Marquis haven't yet been married.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When will the bridegroom get married?

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The Marquis will be in trouble if something happens.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The Marquis has been collecting the goods every day.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He wants to kill all the people of Bianzhou.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please save us, Your Majesty.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The road is long enough.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But if the altar is higher,

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it might be better.

155
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Look.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's a woman in red.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's Qiao Nu, right?

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's Qiao Nu.

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
She's just like the rumors.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She's so beautiful.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I wonder if the Marquis will like her.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When will they get married?

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If they get married,

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
they will be a couple.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think so.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I think so.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think so.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
When will they get married?

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If they get married,

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
they will be a couple.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Take it easy.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Just find a good one.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Your Highness.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You really care about me.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You mean

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you agreed to marry Marquis?

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's what I mean.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think I know how to break the spell.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sir,

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
give me some money.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you okay?

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you, Miss.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you, Miss.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's a deep pit on the road in the winter.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Our female wolf is being punished.

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can you help us

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to get off the road?

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We can dance on the road.

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm willing to go.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We're all willing to go.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm willing to go.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sir,

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
the people are on the road.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Why?

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Qiao Nu is bribing us.

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sir,

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the people

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
are bribing us.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They are bribing us.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sir,

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the people are going to repair the water well.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Really?

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why are they

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
going to the well?

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's eat.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The female wolf

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is going to repair the road

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to thank you.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
She prepared food for you.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She's a good person.

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
She doesn't care about the water,

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but the well is in ruins.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's okay.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't worry.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We'll repair it together.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What do you think?

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Is it worth the money?

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We don't dare to trouble you.

224
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right?

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I heard that Qiao Nu likes to buy flowers.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Many people picked wild flowers to send to her.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Qiao Nu is indeed

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a few days old.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The water well has been repaired.

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The road has been cleared.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think the wild flowers

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and weeds on the roadside

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
are almost cleared.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I hope you enjoy it!

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you. Thank you!

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I really want to thank you.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I hope the female wolf likes it!

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you! Thank you!

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I hope you enjoy it!

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you!

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you!

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I hope she likes it!

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you!

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So many flowers.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't let them go.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let them see me off.

248
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,920
Love all USA

249
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
No use makes resize

250
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,120
One likes

251
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,880
because they yearn for it

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,280
Do you want to say

253
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,280
the people love you

254
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
and care about you?

255
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,240
I don't mean that.

256
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
The people are nice to me

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,600
because they admire me,

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,560
and appreciate my kindness.

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,840
Everyone knows

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
I'm the daughter of Qiao family in Yanzhou.

261
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,240
Compared to the people in Bianzhou,

262
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,920
I'm the one

263
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,720
who is most hated by the Marquis of Wei.

264
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
If the Marquis of Wei marries me

265
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
without considering the past,

266
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,080
it means the Marquis of Wei is kind-hearted.

267
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,320
The people will no longer fear the Marquis of Wei

268
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,640
and will be loyal to him.

269
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,720
You're good at talking.

270
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
You're trying to make me marry you.

271
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,600
It's the will of the people.

272
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,120
Why don't you follow the will of the people

273
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,360
and hand over the seal to me?

274
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll never marry you.

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,040
The capital of Xin is the territory of Wei.

276
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,480
I share the same heart with the people.

277
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,480
Li Su is the one who first made up the story.

278
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,000
You're the one who's playing with the book.

279
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
You're also a traitor.

280
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,840
Don't think

281
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm as good as my grandfather.

282
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,960
As for the seal,

283
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,800
I advise you to make up your mind soon.

284
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm a little patient,

285
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,920
but

286
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,520
not much.

287
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,000
His Highness

288
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,880
This Marquis of Wei

289
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
is really loyal.

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,360
If he's that persuasive across the board,

291
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,120
I can't trust him anymore.

292
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,040
What about

293
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,760
us then?

294
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,400
My heart is like

295
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,680
the stream I see.

296
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I didn't expect that Qiao Nu is quite difficult to investigate.

297
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Master has been fighting day and night to win back the new capital.

298
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,120
These people can only be given flowers to Master.

299
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,320
Master doesn't care about those flowers and grass.

300
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,720
Otherwise, wouldn't it be like competing with a meat girl?

301
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,120
Right. What Master didn't do, Qiao Nu did.

302
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,720
Master is angry about this.

303
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,320
Good. You're usually like a dumb person.

304
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,720
You can talk like a dumb person.

305
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,920
Brother, brother, hold on.

306
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
Go.

307
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,320
Wei Hou, calm down.

308
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,720
I didn't open my eyes. I was wrong, Wei Hou.

309
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,120
Are those flowers for Qiao's?

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,520
They're for Wei Hou.

311
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Wei Hou is brave and brave.

312
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,320
I heard that Wei Hou will be the new capital's chief.

313
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Qiao's is Wei Hou's future wife.

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
So I gave them to Qiao.

315
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,920
Okay, give them to me. I'll take them for Master.

316
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,720
Don't give these to those who don't like them.

317
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,520
Let's go.

318
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,920
Yes. Thank you, Wei Hou.

319
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,520
Who said Master doesn't want to be a star?

320
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,120
I think the people here are too blind to see.

321
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,920
Then why aren't they willing to register and get food?

322
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,120
Give them a few more days.

323
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,720
Three feet of ice is not enough for one day.

324
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm still a little impatient.

325
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,120
Let's go.

326
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,320
Go.

327
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,920
Go.

328
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,720
Go.

329
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
The Magistrate!

330
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,920
Help us!

331
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Wei Hou is killing people!

332
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,520
They're attacking us every day.

333
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
They're trying to kill the people from Bianzhou.

334
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,320
They're trying to take our food.

335
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,920
But their daughter can't stay.

336
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,920
The capital has changed.

337
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,920
It's not your Magistrate anymore.

338
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Although Master has regained his power,

339
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
the people of the capital

340
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,920
are no longer the people of Wei.

341
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,120
You want to quickly arrest them.

342
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
But they've been provoked.

343
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,720
They might not understand Master's thoughts immediately.

344
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,720
Moreover,

345
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,720
you didn't just defeat the capital to avenge them.

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,120
You have even greater ambitions.

347
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,720
You need the help of the people.

348
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,920
Master,

349
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,320
a person is like a river.

350
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
You can't remember.

351
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,520
Then let's see who

352
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
I can remember.

353
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,120
The battle in the capital.

354
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,920
Many people died in the battle.

355
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,720
After Li Su entered the city,

356
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,120
he ordered to strictly restrict the people from collecting the bones

357
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,920
and hiding their relatives.

358
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,120
The people secretly found the relatives' belongings

359
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,520
on the eastern border

360
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
on the opportunity to leave the city.

361
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,320
They hid them in their arms and brought them back to the city.

362
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,320
This wall

363
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
was the wall that

364
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
the people of the capital used to live in.

365
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
This wall

366
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,920
was built from the remains of the old man.

367
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
But as time went by,

368
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
people slowly

369
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,920
took this place as a place to pray.

370
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,720
But they forgot the original meaning.

371
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,120
This wall is a map

372
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,320
for the people to remember their relatives.

373
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,320
For Nan Zhi,

374
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,920
it's a starting point for his family.

375
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,720
I came to the capital

376
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,720
to promote the marriage between Nan Jun and you.

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,920
So that you can rest assured.

378
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,120
This is the wish card.

379
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,120
May you have a good marriage.

380
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,320
Thank you.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,120
Where is Wei Duo?

382
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Didn't I tell you to get rid of all the people? Why are you still here?

383
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Master,

384
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
the habit of more than ten years

385
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
can't be changed.

386
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
What are you doing here?

387
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Wei Hao,

388
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,920
I'm praying for the people.

389
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Praying?

390
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Do you know where this is?

391
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
This is the place

392
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
where the people pray.

393
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Why did you build this wall?

394
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,320
You let me pray here?

395
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,320
How many of you remember

396
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,320
why you built this wall?

397
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,320
Who did this?

398
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,120
Come on.

399
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Take these things off.

400
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Burn them all.

401
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Why can't we burn them?

402
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,120
You're not worthy of being a traitor.

403
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
You're not worthy of being a traitor.

404
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
You're not worthy.

405
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,520
Not long.

406
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Why are you here?

407
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,680
This is the subordinate of the old Marquis

408
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,080
He lost the campaign

409
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
He did it for the sake of the people

410
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,080
and re-established the rite of surrender

411
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,680
The Marquis has forgiven the Xieliu

412
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,920
He has forgiven the Xieliu

413
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,160
He has forgiven the Xieliu

414
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,800
He has forgiven the Xieliu

415
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,320
He has forgiven the Xieliu

416
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
The Southern Army watched

417
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,080
their own father, brother and people

418
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,720
suffer a lot

419
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,840
How can he let it go?

420
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,200
This is also the reason

421
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,680
why Mrs. Xu wants to marry Yanzhou

422
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,200
She really cares about the Southern Army

423
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,920
She hopes she can let go of the past

424
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,320
and live a more relaxed life

425
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,520
Yulan, what's wrong?

426
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,640
I think I know what she needs

427
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,480
Li Su is a thief

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,480
You can't go anywhere for the sake of the young

429
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Li Su sent troops to steal food

430
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,920
Now you are the new governor

431
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,600
You still force the people to give you food, wine and women

432
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,200
What does Li Su mean?

433
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,240
Yes, just like Li Su

434
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
Just like Li Su

435
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,200
The old Marquis is benevolent

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,880
You

437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,520
You really don't deserve to be his descendant

438
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,280
I will never give up

439
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,560
Poor...

440
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,560
Poor new governor

441
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,520
He is a traitor

442
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Master, kill this man first

443
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
He is a monster

444
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,080
Yes, master

445
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,880
Kill him

446
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,600
Kill him, master

447
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,480
You can't leave, master

448
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,240
Master, if you kill Zhenzhi

449
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,040
you will lose all your power

450
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,320
Master, please be serious

451
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,120
We worked hard to open the new governor

452
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,080
Do you want these people to be scolded by our ancestors?

453
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
The queen must come

454
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,160
Be careful of the danger

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,280
Master, you must kill this man

456
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Master, kill him

457
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,120
Master, please

458
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
I have something to tell you

459
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,760
Just in time

460
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,280
Let him in

461
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,760
You are the one who started this

462
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,600
What do you want to say?

463
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
I just made up an idea

464
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
After the new marriage is postponed for three days

465
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,760
if you miss it, you will wait for a long time

466
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
Marquis Wei pushed the marriage contract repeatedly

467
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
because he just entered the new capital

468
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,040
and was busy repairing the city

469
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,040
But now these people don't obey Marquis Wei

470
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,480
and don't want to listen to Marquis Wei

471
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,560
They are all afraid of the new governor

472
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,320
They are afraid of the new governor

473
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
They are afraid of the new governor

474
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,600
Marquis Wei doesn't want to listen to Marquis Wei

475
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,760
Does Marquis Wei want the soldiers in the army

476
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,200
to burn bricks with them?

477
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,680
I have a plan to solve Marquis Wei's problem

478
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,960
The tens of thousands of people in the new capital

479
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
are mostly living in the capital

480
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,920
Now they don't want to obey Marquis Wei

481
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,520
Why don't we

482
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,800
kill the one who is white

483
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
and be a good friend?

484
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,960
Ten people are not enough

485
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
Ten people are not enough

486
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,000
Kill them all

487
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,320
You are so cruel

488
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,560
In this way

489
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,000
we can also get married

490
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,200
You are indeed the granddaughter of the thief

491
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
You are a vicious person

492
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,400
The thief assassinated Marquis Wei last night

493
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
Now he is humiliated

494
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,800
He can't be kept

495
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,800
If we don't talk about the city

496
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,520
We have to kill his whole clan

497
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
to solve the problem

498
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,800
You are so cruel

499
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,920
You are so cruel

500
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,680
You are so cruel

501
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
You are so cruel

502
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,680
You are so cruel

503
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,760
You are so cruel

504
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
You are so cruel

505
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,200
Yu Long

506
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
It's Zhu Ge

507
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,280
If I believe you

508
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,520
I will do whatever you want

509
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,880
Your grandfather was killed by me

510
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,960
But you are so cruel

511
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,720
You let me

512
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,080
kill the whole city for you

513
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,960
You are so evil

514
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,800
You are evil

515
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,920
You are evil

516
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,680
Master

517
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,720
Calm down

518
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
Calm down

519
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,920
I am ignorant

520
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,520
I have to forgive you

521
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
I will not forgive you

522
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,160
I should have seen you

523
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,720
I will not believe his trick

524
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
I have seen the people of the capital

525
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,680
I can't understand your plight

526
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,680
Wallace

527
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
I didn't remember

528
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,680
I told you. I know everything

529
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
Now I know

530
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,480
How can it be possible?

531
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,880
No

532
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
As for the시�率 Hands

533
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
You're not my husband.

534
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,820
Forget it.

535
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,840
Just go.

536
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,820
Don't go.

537
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,560
I've been applauding you on the incidentவ

538
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,600
for the last 14 years.

539
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,820
May you live a long and prosperous life.

540
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:34,020
May you live a long and prosperous life.

541
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

542
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,660
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

543
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,380
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

544
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,320
She's gonna kill her.

545
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,320
Oh.

546
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,760
That's her.

547
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,800
That's her...

548
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
That's her...

549
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,360
The Prince of Qin's shadow is over there.

550
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,960
She's found herself in the sand solar society.

551
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,640
We should not hesitate now.

552
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,120
This place is too hideous.

553
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,440
Look,

554
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
She's a little ugly.

555
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,560
Can you see clearly from so far away?

556
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,760
Just say she's ugly.

557
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,560
Marquis Wei,

558
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,240
you can't marry her.

559
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,840
Just drive her out of the capital.

560
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,760
Leave now.

561
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,320
Marquis Wei has his own decision.

562
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes.

563
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,480
Let's go.

564
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,200
Leave.

565
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's go.

566
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,880
Let's go.

567
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,080
Vow of Love

568
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,440
I think you're

569
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,440
different from the front row's pieced.

570
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
I know

571
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
you're pretending as my sister,

572
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,040
but the thing is

573
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,840
in this trick of Qiao's family

574
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,080
that rationalizing his activists

575
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,000
as a way to drive

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,280
everyone crazy.

577
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,160
I can see you.

578
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,120
But I don't know how the world works.

579
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm not a human.

580
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,520
But

581
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
you're a little better than your grandfather.

582
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,040
You have to pay a little price

583
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,800
when you're acting.

584
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,440
Wipe your neck with this wound.

585
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,480
Wipe your neck with this wound.

586
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,040
Marquis Wei.

587
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,760
Congratulations on the recovery of the people of Mingxin.

588
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,520
This is a gift for Marquis Wei

589
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,960
from Zhong Ao.

590
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,920
Go.

591
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,160
What does it mean?

592
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,960
Kids don't understand this, do they?

593
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,720
It's about a couple

594
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,040
with a heart of a free man.

595
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,520
What does it mean?

596
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,720
Say something.

597
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,080
Next one.

598
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,400
Here, take it.

599
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,640
Thank you.

600
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,760
Marquis Wei, thank you for your food.

601
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

602
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,720
All of them.

603
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,560
The food is out today.

604
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,520
Come back tomorrow.

605
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
Why is it out again?

606
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,320
It's all out again.

607
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,440
It's all out again.

608
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,120
Don't go.

609
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,920
It's all out again.

610
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,480
Don't go.

611
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,200
It's not over yet.

612
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,000
Don't go.

613
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't go.

614
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
There's no food left.

615
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,760
Don't go.

616
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Don't go.

617
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,720
What's going on?

618
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,280
The food is out again today.

619
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,440
It's all out.

620
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,520
There are too many people.

621
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,240
Marquis Wei.

622
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,720
Everyone, listen to me.

623
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,200
To prevent everyone from robbing,

624
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,880
we will send out food on time every day.

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,040
If we don't have enough food,

626
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,200
we will increase the food.

627
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,440
We will increase the food.

628
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,640
We will increase the food.

629
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
We will increase the food.

630
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,320
Everyone, be careful.

631
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
I promise you here

632
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,080
that everyone has food.

633
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,760
Go back today.

634
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,240
OK.

635
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,280
We believe Marquis Wei.

636
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,280
Come back tomorrow.

637
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,080
We believe Marquis Wei.

638
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,520
OK.

639
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,120
Marquis Wei.

640
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,840
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

641
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,600
Master.

642
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,760
People are so kind.

643
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,880
Everyone came to get food.

644
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
After the whole village was destroyed,

645
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,080
we found that there were more refugees than we thought.

646
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
You mean

647
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
we brought not enough food from Wei?

648
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,280
In this year's drought,

649
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,760
there is a shortage of food in the whole Wei State.

650
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,680
The relief food brought this time

651
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,880
was also sent out by all the ministries of Wei.

652
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm afraid it's hard to find more food.

653
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,720
But I have promised

654
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,960
that all the people of Xin Du have food.

655
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,080
Master.

656
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
If you want to eat,

657
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,560
you can do it.

658
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,840
OK.

659
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,040
Wei Liao.

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,600
Pull.

661
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,320
One, two, three.

662
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
I heard Marquis Wei

663
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,040
gave all the food to the people of Xin Du.

664
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
It seems that he is not as cruel and ruthless

665
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
as we think.

666
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
He is a tough man.

667
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,280
Although so,

668
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,920
if I hand over the plate,

669
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I will have no more help.

670
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,880
Lady.

671
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,920
I will tear down the wall of the people.

672
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,120
This wall

673
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,680
was piled up by the people of Wei State with their lives.

674
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,800
Now

675
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,320
it has the meaning of hatred.

676
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,760
Instead of making you afraid,

677
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,800
you'd better push it down.

678
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Just because I suffer from the pain of losing my family,

679
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,280
I will never let you suffer again.

680
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,520
So from today on,

681
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,520
the grudges from 14 years ago

682
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,920
will be eliminated.

683
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Whether you are from Yan State,

684
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,360
Bian State

685
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,880
or Liangya State,

686
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
you are Liangya State.

687
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,440
From now on,

688
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
you are all the people of Xin Du.

689
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Mr. Zhen.

690
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,280
You risked your life for the sake of the people.

691
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,880
It's really admirable.

692
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,280
So from now on,

693
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,720
you will take care of Xin Du.

694
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,840
Wei Xu.

695
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
I

696
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,880
obey your order.

697
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,880
Thank you, Master.

698
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
From now on,

699
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
the soldiers of Wei State

700
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:59,140
will encounter the people of Xin Du

701
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,880
Ryan.

702
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,420
Are they간

703
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,060
Thank you released to tell you

704
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,740
Which has been real

705
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,280
Tian doin

706
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,800
uh

707
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,980
ah

708
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:33,340
I'll ask Lord Jing to majesty

709
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,080
can relieve your worries.

710
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,500
Okay.

711
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,340
Since you like reason and piety,

712
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm sure

713
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,620
it'll get better

714
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,540
in the future.

715
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,540
and the people.

716
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,700
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the Shen Family.

717
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,100
I hope that you can accept me

718
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,500
and be the best family for the people of both tribes.

719
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,340
We're not married yet.

720
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,220
Why do you trust me so much?

721
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,140
You're a good man.

722
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,260
Good man?

723
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,080
mess us up.

724
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,140
Do you think I'm such a absinthe?

725
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,060
You're so naïve.

726
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,500
You want to pass the 14-year penalty

727
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,140
I've been laughing at it for 14 years.

728
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,900
Do you really think

729
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,100
you can fool me

730
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,020
by being a fool?

731
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,700
Qiao Gui

732
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,780
has made a good plan.

733
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,380
He wants to send a granddaughter

734
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,900
to a way

735
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,020
to easily fool me

736
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,500
to ally with Yanzhou.

737
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,340
back then,

738
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,940
he söyled like her against my grandfather?

739
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,780
I'm telling you

740
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,700
that everyone in your family

741
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,220
would be enough

742
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,080
See you again

743
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,680
I wish to

744
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
laugh at you

745
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Even if the wind and snow

746
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,080
are not enough to make me miss you

747
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:19,080
I will never forget you

748
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
I wish to cross the sea of mountains

749
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,080
to follow your wind and moon

750
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Waiting for your white hand to be like the first snow

751
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
The rain in Jiangnan is not falling on your eyebrows

752
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
The heart is sad

753
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I wish to stand and watch your smile

754
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:56,280
Even if the wind and snow are not enough to make me miss you

755
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,280
I will never forget you
