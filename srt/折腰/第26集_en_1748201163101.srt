00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was married to Chen Xiang.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It was the same light as today.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But I was still young and I couldn't control myself.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But now, I don't want to do anything else.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't want to do anything else.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't want to do anything else.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't want to do anything else.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I just want to see it in the face of the Duke of Bo.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Zhong Li.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can you let me stay in the Imperial Palace

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and hide from the Duke of Bo?

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why did the Nen Jun come to ask me?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did the Nen Jun feel that something was wrong?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I don't know where it's wrong.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When he came to the Imperial Palace,

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you thought that Asli's matter was a bit fishy.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But he did feel something was wrong.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But he's the one who's the master of the Nen Jun's men.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If he rejects it,

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you'll feel uncomfortable.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you need me to take care of him?

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No need.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Arrange him in the clinic.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, I'll go back to work.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why did you go to stay with that Lady Yulu?

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why did you go to stay with that Lady Yulu?

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Maybe I feel the same way as Nen Jun.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I feel something's wrong.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But I don't know where it's wrong.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sister.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've searched for the maid of the Duke of Bo

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and used some secret tricks to get out of here.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It turns out that the Duke of Bo saw the girl who kidnapped her.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They were both not in the room.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Really?

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They said it was for the maid of the Duke of Bo.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The maid of the Duke of Bo?

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The world is full of men.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's just a matter of being the maid of the Duke of Bo.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If they get married,

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
but they don't have a room,

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
they'll be in a bad mood.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I've searched for some good books.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll go back to the Duke of Bo.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, Sister.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The Duke of Bo.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Lady Yulu, what brings you here?

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been thinking about

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,700
the Duke of Bo's

92
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,000
and the maid of the Duke of Bo's.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought I could share the burden.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What do you think, Lady Yulu?

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
In the meeting,

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you promised to help me

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to get 100,000 gold coins.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I know you agree.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I'm more suitable for the maid of the Duke of Bo.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I've heard that

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
there are many benefits to the maid of the Duke of Bo.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm thinking about what I can do.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
These days,

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I spent a lot of money

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to find some ancient books.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They're all some water-based medicine.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm thinking about using them.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's my help on it.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lady Yulu, you're not interested in it?

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm just a little bit worried.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Some of them

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
don't seem to be that powerful.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
For example, the He Qishu is a water-based medicine.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Many rivers and rivers

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
are hard to be changed.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The complex of the book

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is not easy to understand.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well,

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll take her with me

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to study with the maid of the Duke of Bo.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you, Lady Yulu.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Lord Nan.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Where's the maid?

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's back.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The maid has gone to the washroom.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She's going to the washroom.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She'll be back soon.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Put this down.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Lord Nan, you're back.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's this?

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The water-based medicine

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
from Lady Yulu.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I hope you can use it.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Lord Nan,

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'd like to ask you to sell one of these.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Didn't you go to the washroom

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to study with the maid of the Duke of Bo?

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're back so soon?

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was asked to study with the maid of the Duke of Bo

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to study with the maid of the Duke of Bo.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Here, Lady Yulu, please.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I brought you a bowl of barley tea.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't want to be too surprised.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Please, Lady Yulu.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't be too nervous.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Since you've put the maid of the Duke of Bo

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
in the washroom,

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you're here to sit down.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Lady Yulu,

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you're here to sit down,

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but you can't just sit down

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
because the mountain is in the area.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can only sit down

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and sit down to sit down.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But this seat is really

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
as good as the one

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
from the mountain.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're really good.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're thoughtful.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you have time,

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll give you the full list.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm willing to be the full list of Lady Yulu.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll be the full list.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You...

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Master,

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mr. Zhen Shi has already reached the top.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's going to the top.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He'll be back soon.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
By the way,

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you don't need to know about this.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I already know.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Mr. Zhen Shi has already reached the top

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and has already asked you out.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He also sent you the top of the Mohya Shik.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He said he'd go to Yun Zhong to see the Shik.

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I suddenly remembered

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that there's a mess in Yun Zhong.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I had to send someone there.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's good

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that you guys

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
have something else to do.

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yun Zhong will be in trouble soon.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's in trouble.

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Go.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's this rush?

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Go and have a look.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know where

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
they got the material.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You have to have a look.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Go and have a look.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's go.

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Alright.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So nice.

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're welcome.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you doing?

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm here to see the Shik.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where did you get the material?

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll go and see him.

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Nan Jun.

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,360
This is...

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,080
That's right.

210
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,680
This is the moment of the devil.

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,920
Do you like it?

212
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
I'll move the whole thing back for you.

213
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,720
Look.

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,160
This is...

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
That's right.

216
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,880
This is the one you mentioned.

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
Dong Du Fu.

218
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,960
The inner and outer part of the pig's chin.

219
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Man.

220
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,000
I understand Nan Jun's heart.

221
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,360
But this is...

222
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,280
You don't like it, do you?

223
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,560
Don't pay me.

224
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm sorry.

225
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,600
What's wrong with him?

229
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm so sorry.

232
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,480
This is...

234
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
The ancient treasure.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Who destroyed it?

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
Destroyed?

237
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,480
Why did I move it back?

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm just afraid that others will destroy it.

239
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
This is a human body.

240
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Once it's destroyed,

241
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,320
it will be hard to repair it.

242
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,560
I only moved back one piece.

243
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
The whole piece.

244
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,720
What is this?

245
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,840
What is this?

246
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Yun Zhong Jun,

247
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Lu Tu Yao Yuan,

248
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,720
Chang Tu Ba Shi.

249
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

250
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
And I, Yu Jin Cheng Zhong,

251
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,440
the craftsman of the repair shop,

252
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,160
brought me here.

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,720
I'll fix it for him.

254
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Perfect.

255
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Where did the describes come from?

256
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,700
A heart is based on a body shape.

257
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,800
For pregnancy,

258
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
there's�

259
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,020
muchütting at this state.

260
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,240
What comfort can public

261
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
repair its uses?

262
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,020
What you just said is correct.

263
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,380
I suppose

264
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,780
would Miss

265
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,600
repair our time?

266
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,760
The right time for Mr.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,440
and Yun Zhong Jun Mall truly

268
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,580
sharpened our time.

269
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,640
If you want to restore this time,

270
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,440
the latter will be able to raise the future.

271
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,400
If you don't feel tired,

272
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,840
just take it as a death sentence.

273
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,800
Your Majesty,

274
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
you are so wise.

275
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,400
You are so fierce.

276
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,080
You...

277
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,400
You are even more selfish than a man.

278
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,280
If so,

279
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
I will do my best.

280
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,840
I don't think so.

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

282
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,480
It's just that it's just a few days

283
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,280
after the repair is done.

284
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
It's still being done?

285
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,000
You can rest assured.

286
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
I will take care of you.

287
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
I don't need your help.

288
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
Please, Your Majesty.

289
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Actually, I don't need you to

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
repair our Yu Jun's castle.

292
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,600
Your Majesty.

293
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,600
Don't bother me.

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,160
What a nice couple.

295
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,400
Thisiya.

296
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
Come sit with me and have a cup of drink.

297
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,000
OK, I'll help you with something else.

298
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,800
Alright.

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,520
The tea looks yummy.

300
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,960
You seem to have something on your mind.

301
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,880
I can come to you if I'm not on my mind.

302
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
It's still that Gao He.

303
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,080
After we came back,

304
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,720
we said we'd stay in the fish village for a few more days.

305
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm angry. Why are you laughing?

306
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,960
I told you earlier.

307
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,600
If you really love him,

308
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,480
you should tell him in a hurry.

309
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,480
Brother Liu.

310
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,520
I've already

311
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,160
made a deal with him.

312
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
I haven't come to tell you.

313
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
It's good that you came.

314
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,680
You should be happy.

315
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
How do you look?

316
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,680
Yes, it's a good thing.

317
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,560
But...

318
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,360
But he knows I'm in the same boat with him.

319
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,000
He's still so hot-tempered.

320
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,480
And he doesn't have any fans.

321
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,480
I just want to talk to him.

322
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm annoyed.

323
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
There are always

324
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,560
some people who don't have fans.

325
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,480
Gao Hong is actually good.

326
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,440
He's just a good-looking, talented girl.

327
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,680
But there are people

328
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,200
who believe in the past.

329
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,640
Who dares?

330
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,920
I heard

331
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,800
that Mrs. Yu Lou

332
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
was sincere to you.

333
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,480
You wanted her to stay in the fish village.

334
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,120
Who are you talking to?

335
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,480
I'm just taking care of her for the sake of the elder brother.

336
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,120
How can I...

337
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,920
There are many ways to take care of her.

338
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,560
Send her home.

339
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,560
No matter how hard the festival is,

340
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,600
I'll take care of her.

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,760
Take care of her.

342
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,080
Take her as a relative

343
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,600
and treat her as a family member.

344
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
Or...

345
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,600
Take care of her

346
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,800
for the sake of the elder brother.

347
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,960
Are you serious?

348
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm just taking care of her for the sake of the elder brother.

349
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,680
I can't do anything to her.

350
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,600
I asked you to drink with me today.

351
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,760
But I'm so angry now.

352
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,320
Thank you.

353
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,120
Sorry.

354
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,160
I forgot to forgot to answer the phone number.

355
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,800
Don't get picked up from the plan.

356
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
You have no intention.

357
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,200
We should go and prepare cups.

358
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,880
No.

359
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
Add some Dou Sakuen.

360
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
I will make atransmission from the public Ingru.

361
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,420
Let's forget about our past.

362
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,840
The second one is about HMO

363
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,120
and the sixth one is about HMO.

364
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,600
They've been added to their bag since 1996

365
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,380
and hid the situation in your castle.

366
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,000
The next step will be to be

367
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,280
Oops, he's back!

368
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,340
Well said.

369
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,240
The second lady Amsterdam is

370
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,040
barely sleeping,

371
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,300
although she can't let go of her arm.

372
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Well,

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,120
she doesn't,

374
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,000
except for having a similar behavior as I've said in the previous episode

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
all my improvements.

376
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,280
Chen Zhongyuan,

377
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,640
I respect you very much.

378
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
I don't need to go see.

379
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,320
Dachuan, Ming City...

380
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,760
Do you want to know about it?

381
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,520
Your mind is dry.

382
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Greatness is hard to settle,

383
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,560
Smash and pound.

384
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,320
I'll send you off.

385
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,920
Since you're here,

386
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,360
no need to talk about it.

387
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,920
Who's the hostess from that place?

388
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,760
Is it that girl from his colleague Sailor Moon?

389
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,200
You've got her everywhere.

390
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
Yep.

391
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
Don't bother go back.

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Go back home.

393
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,480
If you don't want to someone who's left his room,

394
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
tell them to leave.

395
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,920
Don't let your chill, bite my teeth.

396
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
and have a good conversation with other men,

397
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,000
I believe that there are not many people who can do this to me.

398
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,520
My heart is in love with you.

399
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,160
It's because we are the same person.

400
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
We can have a conversation

401
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,640
and do things together.

402
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
I don't have any suspicion.

403
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,520
I only have one man

404
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,960
who knows about this life.

405
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,440
Then I am your friend.

406
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
What does Gao Heng mean to you?

407
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,840
Mr. Gao is a talented man.

408
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
His reputation is in the middle.

409
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,920
If such a person can do anything for the country,

410
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
he can ruin the reputation of the man.

411
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,760
If you say so,

412
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
you are doing this for me.

413
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,200
But suddenly I thought

414
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,240
I was wrong.

415
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,880
Wrong? Where?

416
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,640
The man is looking at me,

417
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,120
so he doesn't want me to be close to him.

418
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Even if we only talk and talk,

419
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
the more we have to take a step,

420
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,920
the more man will fall into the trap.

421
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,560
You are not that exaggerated.

422
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,880
What did you say?

423
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,240
It used to be my life.

424
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,560
Now I just need to find a way

425
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,720
to send Mr. Gao Heng away.

426
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,840
What about the other people you want to leave?

427
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,960
I am doing this for the man.

428
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,280
If the man is unhappy,

429
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
he will be punished.

430
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
In your head,

431
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,000
Jean is a money-seeker.

432
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Doesn't that affect your relationship?

433
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,600
All for what it is.

434
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:39,960
If that's what

435
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,120
I show off at a weekend if I go on a gig,

436
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,160
I will be a clown.

437
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,560
I...

438
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,640
Isn't that Vanguard?

439
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
If the man doesn't love face

440
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,960
or an colleague,

441
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,600
his one signature is the words

442
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,760
slower than the other.

443
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,900
We two

444
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,860
I don't care.

445
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Although Nanzhen doesn't like it,

446
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,860
I should be more careful.

447
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,900
Good.

448
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,940
As you said.

449
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,420
Do you see the moon?

450
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
It's too dark there.

451
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,140
Don't tell me—

452
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,760
Never mind.

453
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,220
Okay, I'll go get my gift.

454
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,120
Why is the two of them so young?

455
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,100
I'm afraid

456
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
I can't forget you.

457
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,700
Nan Jun,

458
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Mrs. Yu Lou is here.

459
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,700
It's so late. She invited me here.

460
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,700
Mrs. Yu Lou said

461
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,500
she was looking for a few drops of water to drink.

462
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
It's urgent.

463
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
That's why she came here so late.

464
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,500
But there are many ways to take care of her.

465
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
Send her home.

466
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
I'm not a kind of person who can't get married.

467
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,100
Leave her in the prison.

468
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,900
Be a kind of person who can be a relative.

469
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Or

470
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
be a kind of person who can be a brother.

471
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,900
Go back and tell her that I'll go tomorrow.

472
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,500
And

473
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
prepare some food for me.

474
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes.

475
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Why do you want to see me?

476
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I just found some basic things to do.

477
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,900
I want you to see me.

478
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
I brought these

479
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
to your wife's wedding.

480
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,900
Do you like them?

481
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
You don't have to be so emotional.

482
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,900
When I get emotional,

483
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
my brother told me to take good care of me.

484
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
But because of the crisis,

485
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
I can't go back and forth.

486
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
So I think

487
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
I should send her back to Wushan.

488
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
My family will take care of her.

489
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Shonglin wants to take me away?

490
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
I know what you're worried about.

491
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm afraid I can't rely on you.

492
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
So I specially prepared these gifts for you.

493
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
To mark the importance of your wife's marriage.

494
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
The wedding will be held in the Spring Festival.

495
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
To mark the marriage.

496
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
No one dares to bully you since you're here.

497
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I was wrong.

499
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Back then, I came to seek protection.

500
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
I was thinking about the love

501
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
between Wei and Xia'er.

502
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
But how long can love last?

503
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Su's family has decided

504
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
that I have the chance to be a maid.

505
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
I will lead the Wushan State

506
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
to take care of the family.

507
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I will lead the Wushan State to take care of the family.

508
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
I will do everything I can.

509
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
I will not compare the marriage

510
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
between the King of Liang and Wang.

511
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
My family will definitely accept it.

512
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
People say that

513
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
the King of Liang is a good man.

514
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
He is a good man.

515
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
He is a good man.

516
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Do you know

517
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
why I don't want to marry him?

518
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Because he knows

519
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
the love between Wei and Xia'er.

520
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
He will use my identity and background

521
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
to deal with Wei.

522
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
I know your difficulty.

523
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
After the meeting,

524
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
you suppressed the brothers.

525
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Wei is in a state of chaos.

526
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
As you said,

527
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
remember that

528
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
you have the power to lead the people.

529
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
You will be the enemy

530
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
of the people.

531
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
If

532
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
the King of Liang and Wang's order

533
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
is changed,

534
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
why don't

535
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
I take the position of body and soul

536
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
and take the position of ear.

537
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
I will help the country

538
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,900
and save the country.

539
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
It is also

540
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
a return to the family

541
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
that I have been caring for for many years.

542
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
That's unnecessary.

543
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Since I sent my wife back to Wushan State,

544
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
I will surely take care of the world.

545
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
If

546
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
anyone tries to make you suffer,

547
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
it will be a great loss.

548
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Madam.

549
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,900
Madam, you are too kind.

550
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
You are a head-tongued criminal.

551
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
Please come again next time.

552
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Head-tongued criminal?

553
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Wei is a young man.

554
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
He is a head-tongued criminal.

555
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Madam Yulou

556
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,900
has been in a state of chaos

557
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
to take care of you for many days.

558
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
That's why she has left this disease.

559
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Then you

560
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
go back to your room.

561
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Cut.

562
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Wei is coming.

563
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
It's been a long time.

564
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
It's better to kill him.

565
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
He has recovered.

566
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Wei, please return him to his position as soon as possible.

567
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Because only in

568
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
the three provinces of Yun and Zhong

569
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
can he show his great ambition.

570
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I will go back to the capital

571
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
and take care of the country.

572
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
I will go back to the capital

573
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
and take care of the country.

574
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
I will go back to the capital

575
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
and take care of the country.

576
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
But this is my personal job.

577
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
You can say it.

578
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,900
I want to see if he is recovered.

579
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
This time,

580
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
he is not going to be in this situation.

581
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,940
Why is it written as a stone?

582
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,600
Or is it a mold?

583
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,260
It feels as if it's a stone.

584
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,260
Sir, you're so altruistic.

585
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,300
In a word,

586
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,900
this has to be Mr. Feng Quan's

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,660
most question.

588
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,940
When is the inter yellow羊 gousa?

589
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,100
What do you mean?

590
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,220
Hey,

591
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,700
sir.

592
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,900
You really didn't do that?

593
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,940
I never did?

594
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
How can I be so fast-paced

595
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,300
in choosing a leading voice?

596
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,140
Translated by 丽树

597
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,780
I won't be punished.

598
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,900
the day after tomorrow

599
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,540
Hello, Doctor Xun,

600
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,820
we're here.

601
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,620
Got a fever?

602
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
What's wrong?

603
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,780
Xun.

604
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Got a fever?

605
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,300
Yes.

606
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,540
Why are you up there?

607
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,900
That's because we're carrying honorifics

608
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
to the others.

609
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,500
Tell him

610
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,540
to get up.

611
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,780
You?

612
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,180
What happened?

613
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,700
Hero bacteria.

614
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,400
Master.

615
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,120
I'll go.

616
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,360
Sir, come in.

617
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,520
What's the matter?

618
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,920
I just planned to send the stone to Yun Zhong Jun

619
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
in person

620
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
in case of an accident.

621
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,360
I'll go first.

622
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,720
Don't worry.

623
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,440
I'll be there, sir.

624
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,360
Then I'll ask you something.

625
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
When will you come here?

626
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
I won't come back.

627
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I like to travel around,

628
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
but I left early

629
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
because of the damage to the stone.

630
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,360
That's a pity.

631
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,840
Well,

632
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
tomorrow,

633
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
I'll send you out personally.

634
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Then I'll be there.

635
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,360
Yes, sir.

636
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,360
I'll go first.

637
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Wei Hong,

638
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I just want to share with you

639
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,360
some new things about Zhongwu.

640
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
It might be better to be quick.

641
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
There's an action

642
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
that might help you.

643
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Come on.

644
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Come on.

645
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Let's do it together.

646
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Come on, gather up.

647
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
This way.

648
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
That's the way.

649
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Then,

650
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,360
Yun Rui,

651
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
this is the essence.

652
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
You just did the action.

653
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Please sit.

654
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Well, Song Zhou,

655
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
your leg

656
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
is not strong enough.

657
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Please.

658
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Very good.

659
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
This...

660
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
Sir, you...

661
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Didn't you say

662
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
you've never done a dance?

663
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
I've never done a dance

664
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
to protect my father's power.

665
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm...

666
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Sir, what's your plan

667
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
for this trip?

668
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
I have no plan.

669
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,400
I want to go to the big mountain

670
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,360
of Zhongyuan

671
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
every week

672
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,360
but I have to go somewhere.

673
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Yongming District.

674
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
Why do you want to go to Yongming District?

675
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Sir.

676
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
The world

677
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
is full of water and water.

678
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
The future is full of love and love.

679
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
The world is full of life and fortune.

680
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Gao Mo,

681
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
I'm so grateful.

682
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Sir, it's my fault

683
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
that I'm in a bad mood.

684
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm already grateful.

685
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
This car is all equipped with

686
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
some books

687
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
and play games.

688
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
I hope you can see them.

689
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,320
Thank you.

690
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
I've heard about Mr. Gao's name.

691
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
I've been in a bad mood

692
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
and couldn't visit him.

693
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I came here today

694
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
to prepare some gifts.

695
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Please accept it.

696
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
I dare not.

697
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Of course, it's not like

698
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Zhonglin's thought.

699
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
It's not my thought.

700
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
You prepared

701
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
all these things.

702
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
All right.

703
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Gao Mo, you're ready.

704
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Everyone,

705
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
please take your time.

706
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Please take your time.

707
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Please take your time.

708
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Mrs. Yu Long.

709
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Brother Liao.

710
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
I'll go back with you first.

711
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
I'll go back with you.

712
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I'll go back with you.

713
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
I'll go back with you.

714
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I'll go back with you.

715
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
I'll go back with you.

716
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll go back with you.

717
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I'll go back with you.

718
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I'll go back with you.

719
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
I'll go back with you.

720
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I'll go back with you.

721
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
I'll go back with you.

722
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
I'll go back with you.

723
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
I'll go back with you.

724
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
I'll go back with you.

725
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
I'll go back with you.

726
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
I'll go back with you.

727
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I'll go back with you.

728
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
I'll go back with you.

729
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
I'll go back with you.

730
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
I'll go back with you.

731
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
I'll go back with you.

732
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
I'll go back with you.

733
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
I'll go back with you.

734
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
I'll go back with you.

735
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
I'll go back with you.

736
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,200
I'll go back with you.

737
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,160
I'll go back with you.

738
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
There areagement.

739
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,640
Theität is scarce.

740
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,600
I know how to explain it.

741
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,880
I know how to explain it.

742
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
You're right.

743

What are you looking for?

Don't look for it.

753
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,200
It's just a phone.

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,600
Don't look for it.
