You're home early today.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,500
(Wise Kashyapa Who Governs Eternally)

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,340
I am.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,580
To congratulate you.

34
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,660
Why is that?

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,020
Do you know

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,460
who the Commander of Boya Forces is?

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,820
Who is it?

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,180
Your brother-in-law.

39
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Bi Zhi.

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,980
You must be joking, My Lord.

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,540
My brother-in-law is just a stableman.

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,380
You really don't know?

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,380
Your brother-in-law

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,500
is quite remarkable.

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,820
He not only

46
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,900
defeated Xue Tai,

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,540
but did so more than once.

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,900
Really?

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,980
I can't believe he pulled that off.

50
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,740
That means Cousin's days ahead

51
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,180
could finally be peaceful.

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,340
But then again,

53
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,820
how peaceful can it really be?

54
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,380
He claimed Boya all on his own.

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,420
Different factions

56
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,780
will go after him.

57
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,140
But he's just one man, not much power.

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
My uncle,

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,260
wary of your reputation,

60
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,060
won't accept him easily.

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,660
Neither of them can go home now.

62
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,740
Typical Qiao. Always defiant.

63
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,620
Were you copying sutras just now?

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,420
Yes.

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,820
Do you like the armrest I gave you?

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,460
I do.

67
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,940
It's made from fresh southern bamboo.

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,900
It never feels sticky.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,220
I treasured it too much,

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,900
so I hardly dared use it.

71
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,260
It's all right.

72
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,700
It's not that rare, anyway.

73
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,940
This bamboo, though,

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,780
it's truly quite fine.

75
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,580
My Lord.

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,180
You work so hard every day

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,860
and often suffer headaches.

78
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,460
I thought perhaps,

79
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,900
your pillow wasn't comfortable.

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
So I made you a new one.

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,460
(That pattern…)

82
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,180
(What's she trying to imply?)

83
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,900
Did you embroider it?

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,860
No.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,660
I asked Chunniang to sew it,

86
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,180
but I picked the fabric myself.

87
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,220
And this pattern…

88
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,700
I…

89
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,980
I just thought

90
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,140
the fabric was so soft.

91
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,340
It must be comfortable for sleep.

92
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,700
Thank you.

93
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,300
Why is he acting so odd today?

94
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,940
He insisted you read and write here.

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,780
Wait.

96
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,660
The fabric is
of Flourishing Descendants pattern.

97
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,140
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,180
Flourishing Descendants?

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,660
You said it was just soft fabric.

100
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,540
And,

101
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,580
that armrest's jade.

102
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,740
You didn't say that either.

103
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,980
My Lord.

104
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,780
Rest assured, sir.

105
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,220
I've already asked her.

106
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,020
As for this matter,

107
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,370
no matter how bold the Qiao Clan is,

108
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,090
they wouldn't dare raise a flag in Boya.

109
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,100
What did Mrs. Wei say?

110
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,220
You can rest assured.

111
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,420
Bi Zhi may have some skills

112
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,980
and defeated Xue Tai several times,

113
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,420
but the Qiao Clan won't accept him.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,620
He's just

115
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,020
looking for a foothold.

116
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,740
As long as there's no flag,

117
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,660
Boya remains unclaimed.

118
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,100
And since he's fighting Xue Tai,

119
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,580
he poses no threat to us.

120
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,980
Just keep things as they are.

121
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,460
Only a few hundred men?

122
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,860
General,

123
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,900
those hunting in the woods

124
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,060
were very agile.

125
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,300
Not mere servants.

126
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Wei Shao

127
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,980
has intervened in Boya,

128
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,820
dressing his soldiers in plain clothes.

129
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,660
What's his intention?

130
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,980
Luckily, we didn't rush to attack.

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,660
He was once Qiao's stableman,

132
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,180
and is Qiao Yue's son-in-law now.

133
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,140
In truth,

134
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,540
he's family to the Wei traitors.

135
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,260
Yanzhou has two such sons-in-law now,

136
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,820
and they're both carving out territory.

137
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,860
We won't engage.

138
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,890
Withdraw the troops.

139
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

140
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,660
Xue Tai has withdrawn?

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,860
That's right.

142
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,500
He left just like that?

143
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
My friend,

144
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,900
we owe this to you.

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,340
General, you flatter me.

146
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,260
I didn't do much.

147
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,220
Even though Xue Tai has retreated,

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,700
we declared ourselves

149
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,860
commander here.

150
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,900
There will be trouble again.

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,420
So what should we do?

152
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,940
You drove off the bandits

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,140
and have won the people's trust.

154
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,460
Find a hilltop

155
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,020
and raise a command flag.

156
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,660
It'll look like you're asking

157
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,680
for the people's support.

158
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,020
If you do this,

159
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
more will follow you,

160
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,220
and fewer will cause trouble.

161
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,100
But what kind of flag?

162
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,740
I only know horses.

163
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,900
That's easy.

164
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,220
I've seen plenty of flags.

165
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,700
Bring a plain piece of cloth.

166
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,840
Xing.

167
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,700
Yes.

168
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,660
But what should we write on it?

169
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,780
We can't write "Zhi" (swine).

170
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,140
A command flag

171
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,780
declares ownership.

172
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
If it bears the character "Wei,"

173
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,140
it means this place belongs to Wei.

174
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,740
If trouble arises later,

175
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,900
Wei will have to step in.

176
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,220
If it becomes Wei territory,

177
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,860
wouldn't that cause problems
for the Lord of Wei?

178
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,460
Xue Tai is stationed at Xiaogang,

179
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,780
across the river from Boya and Panyi.

180
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
This trip

181
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,460
is not for battle,

182
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,620
but to probe.

183
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,500
We can't let others think

184
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,180
that Wei plans to occupy Boya.

185
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,620
Dear, what if

186
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,300
we write your surname,

187
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
Qiao?

188
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
That's a good idea.

189
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,820
Xing, bring more liquor.

190
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,540
We must thank General Wei Qu.

191
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,860
Yes.

192
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,940
(Qiao)

193
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,920
Ma'am.

194
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,780
General Bi Zhi.

195
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,780
Don't bother.

196
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,380
Take care, General.

197
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,580
Take care.

198
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,820
Hyah.

199
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,740
(Qiao)

200
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,660
You raised the flag for Qiao.

201
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,500
You handled such a big matter

202
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,620
and only brought back some wild game

203
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,460
and sacks of rice?

204
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,780
It was my oversight.

205
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,020
You ordered me

206
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,060
to ensure no one thought

207
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,300
Wei intervened.

208
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
But everything was ruined by hesitation.

209
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,340
Looks like all you do is hunt and drink.

210
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,380
After a few drinks,

211
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,540
you've forgotten who you are.

212
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,500
My Lord,

213
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,060
Wei Qu can't be blamed for this.

214
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,580
Who would've thought
Qiao was so bold?

215
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,420
They challenged you

216
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,660
over Boya.

217
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,500
Yong.

218
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,660
Sir.

219
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,800
Sir.

220
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,780
- Speak.
- My voice...

221
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,900
My Lord,

222
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,540
if anyone's to blame, it's Bi Zhi.

223
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,940
All brawn,

224
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,220
no brains.

225
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,380
Fought so hard for a piece of land,

226
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,260
only to fly

227
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,590
his wife's surname on the flag.

228
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,010
Sounds like a kept man.

229
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,180
Who are you mocking?

230
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,340
My Lord.

231
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,380
We haven't seen it coming.

232
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,430
It's a misunderstanding.

233
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
A misunderstanding?

234
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,860
How could things line up so perfectly?

235
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,540
No need for you to tell me.

236
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,700
I know who's behind this.

237
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,460
My Lord,

238
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,580
could it truly be as the advisor said,

239
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,020
that this is Mrs. Wei's doing?

240
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,060
I underestimated her.

241
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,780
You all remember this:

242
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,540
Stay away from the Qiao Clan.

243
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
Or you'll be dumb.

244
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,500
Yes.

246
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,620
You may all rise.

247
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,900
I can

248
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,980
give up Boya,

249
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,100
but I won't just hand it to Yanzhou.

250
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,100
It was a losing game,

251
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,620
yet she managed to turn it around.

252
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,500
(Xiaogang, Boya)

253
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,420
Send the order:

254
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,460
Attack Xiaogang immediately.

255
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,780
My Lord,

256
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,940
Liangya's army guards Xiaogang.

257
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,340
That land belonged to Wei.

258
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,220
But 14 years ago,

259
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,740
it was taken while we were weak.

260
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,540
Lady Qiao

261
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,340
(Panyi)
gave me Panyi without fuss,

262
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,340
(Boya)
but secretly let Bi Zhi take Boya.

263
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,340
That gives Yanzhou a new gateway.

264
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,860
So,

265
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,860
keeping troops in Panyi

266
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,840
will be pointless.

267
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,300
To strike back,

268
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,460
we must open

269
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,980
a new front.

270
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Boya and Xiaogang face each other.

271
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,820
(Xiaogang)
From there,

272
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,940
we can monitor Bi Zhi closely.

273
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,020
You four,

274
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,820
gather the troops.

275
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,020
Set out for Xiaogang.

276
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,900
Wei Qu,

278
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
this is your chance to redeem yourself.

279
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,500
Don't waste it.

280
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,340
Understood.

281
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,500
Any other orders?

282
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,180
From today on,

283
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,100
all correspondence from the Qiao Clan

284
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,660
comes through me.

285
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,020
Got it.

286
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,620
I don't think

287
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,780
any of us should get married.

288
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,340
Marriage just turns

289
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,660
into mind games.

290
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,740
Don't count me in.

291
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,880
Only you

292
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,260
could be outwitted by your own kin.

293
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,900
And My Lord, too.

294
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,020
Enough.

295
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,660
My Lady.

296
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,820
What's this?

297
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,500
You're home early today.

298
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,580
These are wild game from Boya.

299
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,180
And this rice too.

300
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,220
Come.

301
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,260
Specially prepared for you.

302
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,260
Cousin sent these?

303
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes.

304
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,220
You two share a deep bond,

305
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,340
looking out for each other.

306
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,220
It's truly moving.

307
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,180
But it's not even mealtime yet.

308
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,580
I can't eat these.

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,860
You made me shoes,

310
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,980
pillows,

311
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,340
and meals.

312
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,460
This meal

313
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,620
is to thank you.

314
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
Dig in.

315
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,660
Try this.

316
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,740
The meat is good.

317
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,140
- My Lord.
- It's tasty.

318
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,820
I can't eat that much.

319
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
The kitchen made this just for you.

320
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,300
Eat more.

321
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,700
Eat.

322
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,140
He said not to associate with Qiao.

323
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,140
Does that include Xiaotao?

324
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,220
Probably.

325
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,660
Duang,

326
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,700
I heard General Wei Qu is back.

327
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,820
How is Miss Daqiao doing in Boya?

328
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,260
I'm talking to you here.

329
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,540
Duang.

330
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
Xiaotao,

331
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,020
can you leave me alone?

332
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,860
My Lord said

333
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,540
to stay away from you people.

334
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,740
Said we might turn dumb.

335
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,260
How does your dumbness

336
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,100
have anything to do with us?

337
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,460
Duang, how is she?

338
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,700
Xiaotao,

339
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,620
I'm truly on official duty now.

340
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,740
We messed up in Boya,

341
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,460
and now we're making up for it.

342
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,460
My Lord is sending troops to Xiaogang.

343
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,260
So please, stop bothering me.

344
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,660
Xiaogang?

345
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
I really can't eat more.

346
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,460
Just a bit more.

347
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,300
Look.

348
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,980
The rice is from Boya.

349
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,180
Have some more.

350
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,580
Did you

351
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,660
come here for something?

352
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,940
Not really.

353
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,340
I just wanted to ask you,

354
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,500
what have you been busy with lately?

355
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,580
Needlework and copying sutras.

356
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,860
Besides that?

357
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,540
Studying "The Analects"

358
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
and "The Book of Songs."

359
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,620
For example, letters to your cousin?

360
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,980
Just some

361
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,860
daily reminders.

362
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,700
Daily reminders?

363
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,780
Does that include

364
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,460
raising the Qiao flag in Boya?

365
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,060
I only heard him defeated the bandits,

366
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,220
so I gave a few reminders.

367
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Lady Qiao,

368
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,620
how cunning you are.

369
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,380
I don't understand

370
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,340
what you're saying.

371
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,340
Really?

372
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,260
You pretended to care,

373
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,500
made me drop my guard,

374
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,460
then used the box incident

375
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,860
to make me feel guilty.

376
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
I couldn't

377
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,380
have planned guilt.

378
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,220
You had to be wrong first

379
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,580
for me to use it.

380
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,380
Exactly. You used that guilt.

381
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,780
Faked deep sibling affection.

382
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,820
Used the konghou to draw my concern.

383
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,660
Right?

384
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,380
Missing my cousin is real.

385
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,300
But your love for music is fake, right?

386
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,700
After all these days,

387
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,880
why does it still sound awful?

388
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,860
Besides,

389
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,820
if you want Boya,

390
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,180
you could've just told me.

391
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,620
Why manipulate my men

392
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
to send your letters?

393
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,710
Act all high and mighty

394
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,740
in front of Xue Tai?

395
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,820
No battle fought,

396
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,700
yet the Qiao flag flew over Boya.

397
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,780
My brother-in-law succeeded, huh?

398
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Look at your smug face.

399
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,780
Look in a mirror.

400
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,220
Turns out, I was too naive.

401
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,780
You're a Wei wife in name,

402
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,260
but still a Qiao woman at heart.

403
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,940
He defeated Xue Tai

404
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,700
and helped Wei

405
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,220
get rid of a threat.

406
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,220
Raising the Qiao flag
shouldn't be a big deal.

407
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,660
Qiao and Wei are one family.

408
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,180
You won't attack
the Qiao Clan, will you?

409
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,060
Or,

410
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,380
the marriage between us

411
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,260
was all for show?

412
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,460
Is that why
you stationed troops in Panyi?

413
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,140
I can't out-talk you.

414
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,020
You always win with your words.

415
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,540
Words are all I have here.

416
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,180
Your words drive me mad.

417
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,820
I'm done arguing.

418
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,740
However,

419
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,940
don't think holding a key position

420
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,340
means you can act reckless.

421
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,340
I'll always keep a knife

422
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,420
at Qiao's throat.

423
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,260
Mrs. Wei,

424
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,260
Wei Liang got all mad when he saw me.

425
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,900
Said his lord told him

426
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,540
not to go near the Qiao clan,

427
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,900
or he'd turn dumb.

428
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,460
Can you believe

429
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,580
how ridiculous he was?

430
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,220
But he's not entirely wrong.

431
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,100
Now they're so angry,
they're sending out troops.

432
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,060
Where to?

433
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,580
Xiaogang.

434
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,060
Chunniang.

435
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,540
When will Zhang Pu return to Kangjun?

436
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
My Lady.

437
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,820
He was ill

438
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,060
after coming to Yujun.

439
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,020
He likely hasn't recovered yet.

440
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,740
Have him come see me.

441
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,580
Yes.

442
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,730
Sir, when you return to Yanzhou,

443
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,980
could you take a detour to Boya

444
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,020
and deliver a message

445
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,500
to my cousin?

446
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm still sick.

447
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,140
Can't you just write a letter?

448
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,020
It's of great importance.

449
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,460
You must explain it in person.

450
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,180
Break it down for them.

451
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,260
I see.

452
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,660
Please tell me.

453
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,260
Wei Shao

454
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,620
is attacking Xiaogang today

455
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
to pin down Boya.

456
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,660
But in Yanzhou, there's a place

457
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,980
called Liancheng

458
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,420
close to Xiaogang.

459
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,540
If you take the mountain path,

460
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,180
it's a three-day trip.

461
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,700
Tell my cousin,

462
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,740
to have her husband start mining there.

463
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,780
I've marked

464
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,460
the exact spot on this map.

465
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,500
(Yanzhou, Panyi, Liangya,
Wei State, Bianzhou)

466
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,180
(Boya)

467
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,780
Mining?

468
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,940
(Wei)

469
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,300
(Wei Shao set his sights on Xiaogang)

470
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,380
(as it's easy to defend
and hard to attack.)

471
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,060
(It could be used to pin down Boya.)

472
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,700
(But if we dig)

473
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,420
(a secret tunnel here,)

474
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
(Yanzhou's troops)

475
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,820
(could reach Xiaogang
within half a day.)

476
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,940
(In that case,)

477
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,580
(Xiaogang would be firmly
in Yanzhou's grasp.)

478
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Lady Xu,

479
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Mrs. Wei is here.

480
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Grandmother.

481
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,780
Did you see him off?

482
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,100
I did.

483
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,780
Have a seat.

484
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,060
Do you play Go?

485
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,140
Yes.

486
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,380
But I'm not skilled.

487
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,260
It's an art to be learned.

488
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,380
Beginners often focus

489
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,140
on capturing more pieces,

490
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,540
trying to wipe out the opponent.

491
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,660
And they lose because of it.

492
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,460
To win,

493
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,140
you have to yield a little.

494
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,540
But knowing how much to yield

495
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,100
takes judgment.

496
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,140
If both sides press too hard,

497
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,460
it ends

498
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,540
in a stalemate.

499
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
There may still be a winner,

500
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,940
but the board

501
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,260
looks ugly.

502
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,500
I will remember your words.

503
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,780
Do you think

504
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,740
I was talking about the game?

505
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,420
It was about marriage.

506
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,780
My Lord and I are not enemies,

507
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,860
but allies.

508
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,100
Still, maybe

509
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,940
I'm not good at Go.

510
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,940
I used to see him off to war.

511
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,820
Now you do.

512
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,620
That's a wife's duty.

513
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,140
I'm pleased.

514
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,260
But what I really hope is:

515
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,860
From now on,

516
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,380
Zhonglin will

517
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,660
no longer go to war.

518
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,380
Do you know

519
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,980
what that means?

520
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,380
I understand.

521
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,620
Back then,

522
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,420
when your grandfather proposed,

523
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,260
he wrote me a letter,

524
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,940
confessing his past wrongs.

525
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,180
I resented your grandfather.

526
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,380
His betrayal

527
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,860
cost me my husband,

528
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,260
my son,

529
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,540
and my grandson.

530
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,340
But the dead can't come back.

531
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,180
Even if I wipe out the Qiao Clan,

532
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
would it ease our scars from the past

533
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,900
and the pain in our hearts

534
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,660
even a little?

535
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,260
But if

536
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,500
your marriage with Zhonglin

537
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,660
could resolve this hatred

538
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,900
and help him

539
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,940
let go of his obsessions,

540
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,700
so he no longer

541
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,180
spends his life in mourning,

542
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,940
what more

543
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,460
could I ask for?

544
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
Grandmother,

545
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,300
I've let you down.

546
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,780
It's all right.

547
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,380
Everything takes time.

548
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,220
Let's take it slow.

549
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,740
(Two Months Later)

550
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,740
(Government Office)
The Lord has returned.

551
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:59,740
The Lord has returned.

552
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,620
The Lord has returned.

553
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,580
The Lord has returned.

554
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,420
The Lord has returned.

555
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,620
The Lord has returned.

556
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,140
(Government Office)

557
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,500
My Lord, we claimed
a great victory at Xiaogang.

558
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
We gave Liu Yan of Liangya
a strong warning.

559
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,860
It truly lifts everyone's spirits.

560
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,620
How many times must I tell you?

561
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,540
Never judge by appearances alone.

562
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,060
Stationing troops at Xiaogang

563
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,540
isn't only about intimidating Liangya.

564
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,100
Besides reinforcing Xiaogang,

565
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,980
I have four more

566
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,980
tasks for you.

567
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,820
Yes.

568
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,580
First:

569
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,220
Increase patrols

570
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,340
along the Xiaogang-Liangya border.

571
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,780
You are wise and decisive.

572
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,300
Liangya has always eyed us.

573
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,540
Second:

574
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
Keep close watch

575
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,180
on military movements
between Yanzhou and Boya.

576
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,540
You're thorough and careful.

577
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,260
We must guard against an attack
from Boya.

578
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,300
Third:

579
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,220
Reinforce all frontier outposts.

580
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,340
Your foresight's unmatched.

581
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,700
We must watch every state's moves.

582
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,420
Fourth…

583
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,620
My Lord,

584
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,660
what's the fourth thing?

585
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
The fourth one.

586
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,260
Get my bedding back
to the main chamber.

587
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,900
I'm going to battle Lady Qiao

588
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,220
over every inch of ground.

589
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,780
Howe can you just barge in?

590
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,500
Do you have no respect?

591
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
This is the Lord and Lady's bedchamber.

592
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,260
No matter how often

593
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,460
you used to come,

594
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,340
from now on,
without being summoned,

595
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,660
no one may enter.

596
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,060
If we aren't moving in ourselves,

597
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,180
will you do it?

598
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,460
Didn't you just say

599
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,220
this is the Lord and Lady's bedchamber?

600
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,280
My Lord is moving back in.

601
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,140
Excuse me.

602
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,780
Careful.

603
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,260
Don't crush the Lady's quilt.

604
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,180
Get down.

605
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,060
Stop it. That's Mrs. Wei's books.

606
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,980
Get down.

607
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
Stop it.

608
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,900
What are you doing?

609
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,580
Don't touch the Lady's books.

610
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,860
Wait. She's just a woman,

611
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,900
she reads too?

612
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,140
My Lady could read at three,
recite poems at five.

613
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,220
Of course she reads.

614
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,100
Fine, fine.

615
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,780
Put those useless books
on the dressing table.

616
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,860
He won't use it anyway.

617
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,180
What?

618
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,420
You say it like he doesn't have a face.

619
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,140
The sword. I think it's best here.

620
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,540
It fits well right here.

621
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,620
You're leaving a sword here?

622
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,140
Does he practice it?

623
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,380
He's not just a swordsman.

624
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,860
He kills with ease.

625
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,780
Where should his clothes go?

626
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,660
This one

627
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,900
and those ones are My Lady's.

628
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,340
Well,

629
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
he can use that one.

630
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,500
So small?

631
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,000
Wait.

632
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,540
Why does she take up so much space?

633
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,500
Did she move all of Yanzhou in?

634
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,060
None of you four are married, right?

635
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,140
Anywhere, the woman's wardrobe

636
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,060
is always bigger.

637
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,780
Really?

638
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,500
Makes sense.

639
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,860
With Xiaotao's temper, honestly,

640
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,100
who'd marry her?

641
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,890
What's she to you?

642
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,010
Why worry about that?

643
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,820
Come on.

644
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,900
Don't forget,

645
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,900
she's meant to marry into our family.

646
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,620
Well, just one of us.

647
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,860
Not it.

648
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,060
Me neither.

649
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,300
I'm not marrying her.

650
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,300
You…

651
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,340
Let's draw lots.

652
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,420
Alright. Fine.

653
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,100
Didn't we agree to draw lots?

654
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,220
Where is everyone?

655
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,780
My Lady, you should've seen them.

656
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,540
It was like they were
dividing up territory,

657
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,100
arguing over every inch.

658
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,700
Insisting on which part belonged to him,

659
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,940
and which to you.

660
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,140
But the two of you share a room,

661
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,660
how can it be split so neatly?

662
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,180
People say, easy with the ruler,

663
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,620
tough with the servants.

664
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,180
Just like Grandmother said.

665
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,860
When someone pushes,
another must yield.

666
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,260
I've raised the Qiao flag at Boya.

667
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,010
If he wants to get back elsewhere,

668
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,140
so be it.

669
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,540
Let's organize his things.

670
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,540
As for his bedding?

671
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,380
Just leave it for now.

672
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,500
All right.

673
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,740
What are you doing?

674
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,620
I saw you sleeping uneasily.

675
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,500
Maybe the candlelight was too bright.

676
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,940
So I wanted to put it out.

677
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
Don't.

678
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,180
Just wear more clothes

679
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,580
at night.

680
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,820
Don't try to seduce me.

681
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,060
I am the Lord of Wei.

682
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,540
I won't be swayed by beauty.

683
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,380
I had no such intent.

684
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
You speak in opposites.

685
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,340
You say no,

686
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,460
then it's yes.

687
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,540
If you say so,

688
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,540
then so be it.

689
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,180
Sir, please sit.

690
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,180
My Lord,

691
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,940
my cough hasn't healed yet,

692
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,740
so I dare not

693
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,220
drink with you.

694
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,900
Then,

695
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,140
just sit here

696
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,500
and keep me company.

697
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,700
My Lord,

698
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,060
there are many things

699
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,740
that can be shared with dearest ones.

700
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,180
No need to bear it all alone.

701
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,380
But I have no one to talk to.

702
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,780
No one understands.

703
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,460
It's all because he kills in dreams.

704
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,740
He made you lose sleep.

705
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,940
Even said you tried to seduce him.

706
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,620
How unfair.

707
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,220
He only said it to ease my worries.

708
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,900
You're always defending him.

709
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,660
He just talks, that's all.

710
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,180
He never hurt me.

711
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,180
Forget it. Go make some red bean soup.

712
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,660
My Lord?

713
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,020
Why is it so dark in here?

714
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,940
My Lord?

715
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,460
My…

716
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,540
They say the Lord of Wei kills
in his sleep,

717
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,700
never lets anyone near him
when sleeping.

718
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,820
My Lord.

719
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,660
Xiaozao…

720
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,500
Don't go.

721
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,100
Stay.

722
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,420
What's wrong?

723
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,860
Are you afraid of the dark?

724
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,300
It's okay.

725
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,740
It's all right.

726
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,860
I'm here for you.

727
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,860
It's all right.

728
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,500
Don't be afraid.

729
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,660
I'm right here.

730
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,300
As the saying goes,

731
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,060
"A wise one knows when

732
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,400
to advance and when to retreat."

733
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,300
But this requires careful judgment.

734
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,180
A slight error,
and one crosses the line.

735
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,860
Bear insults

736
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,380
without flinching,

737
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,180
and see faults

738
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,940
without exposing.

739
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,140
My Lady, you should know

740
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,140
the art of wise companionship
better than I do.

741
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,410
You're talking about noble friendships.

742
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,920
But what about marriage?

743
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,140
It's the same

744
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,740
for you and My Lord.

745
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,140
I thought

746
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,980
he'd resent me over Boya.

747
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,100
But these past days,

748
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,380
I've realized he doesn't.

749
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,620
And now I don't know how to face him.

750
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,140
The Lord grew up in hatred,

751
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,700
inherited leadership young.

752
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,380
If he's sometimes cold,

753
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,820
it's only natural.

754
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,980
Please try to understand.

755
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,380
But I've served him in war for years.

756
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,500
I know him

757
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,540
better than anyone.

758
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,980
Then,

759
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,140
what's his true nature?

760
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,420
Tough on the outside,
soft on the inside.

761
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,460
