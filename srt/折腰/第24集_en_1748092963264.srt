00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The high song of the wind will make me feel sleepy

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will give my all to be with you for the rest of my life

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is love the only thing that can save me?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why do I feel so lonely?

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When you are with me, I will be able to fall back to the start

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you are in my arms, I will not let the wind pass

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will cross over the dense fog and rush out to block the wind

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will be with you for the rest of my life

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is love the only thing that can save me?

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will be your hero

Now, Liu Shan is the slave of the King of Liangya

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you understand?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I understand

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I understand

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I understand

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I understand

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Chunniang, help me to cover up

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have to let him know about the letter to Zhang

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your Majesty

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your Majesty, I don't know when the young man left the house

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He is waiting for someone to pick him up at the foot of the river

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ci is here

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The young man didn't bring the talisman

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He should have left the house without permission

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He said that you should go to pick him up

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Prepare the carriage and go to the police station to ask Nanjun to come back

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Forget it

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Nanjun is angry now

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He will be angry when he sees Ci

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your Majesty

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What if Nanjun sees the young man and knows his character

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and removes the ward?

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I hope so

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Uncle made a mistake

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but Ci and brother-in-law are responsible for his anger

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Forget it

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's change clothes and prepare the carriage

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are leaving the city?

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why is there only one carriage?

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No one is escorting you

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
My brother-in-law is in a hurry

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He will be here in a few miles

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to go to welcome him

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't want to bother others

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am free today

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I am looking for Zhong Linning and he is not here

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you don't mind, I will go with you to welcome him

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If it's not a problem, I will trouble you

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
These are the supplies prepared by Shiyi

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yu Pei took them to repair

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You don't have to worry about it

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can rest assured

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will visit my grandparents and sisters when I get better

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But Zhong Linning has one thing to ask

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you polite to me?

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Madam Yulou suffered a lot

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't mean it, but I am sorry

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Zhong Linning, I apologize to you

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You don't have to do this

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I don't know about it

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So please don't tell this to your grandparents and mother

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Zhong Linning will rest here

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't mind

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I don't want to bully you

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What does Madam Yulou mean?

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Outsiders know I am sad

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I am weak and can be bullied

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's why I have this problem

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I heard that Weiguo will hold a big event

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and invite a lot of people

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If Zixin can take part in it

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and fight for the Su family

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and the Su family

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
people will know

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that my family has someone to be friendly with

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I won't be so difficult in the future

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't worry, sister

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Zixin will do her best

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and get a good name at the Lulin Congress

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
so people won't bully you

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am counting on you

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In that case

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will let Zixin take part in the Lulin Congress

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
on behalf of the Su family

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You asked me to repair this

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The shopkeeper said

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the jade pendant can't be restored

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and the female soldier's idea

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
of using gold to build the shop

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
is now a good thing

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is the female soldier in the mansion?

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The female soldier got the news

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that the young man from the Qiao family

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
went out of town to welcome you

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why didn't anyone tell you

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that Qiao Si was here?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He didn't tell you because he was afraid you would be embarrassed

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sister

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Have some fruit

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
After you eat the fruit

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
your brother might be here

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yijun

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sister

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yijun

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Look at Zixin

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He has grown up

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
after so long

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You must have had a hard time

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't have a hard time

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I was just being careless

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and lost my beloved Zhang Qiang

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Zixin

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yishan

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Sister

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong?

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your sister

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is getting more and more confident

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She is young

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and has a hero's spirit

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She is happy

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's okay

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother-in-law

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is your brother-in-law's cousin, Wei Shijun

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He came out to welcome you

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Who is your cousin?

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Brother-in-law

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Brother-in-law

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Grandma and Grandma don't know you are here

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go back

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He is getting more and more unruly

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He is so stubborn

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How can he be like Young Master Yanzhou?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I came out alone

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
so I have a lot of talent

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When you get to the mansion

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you should go to the county

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
for your uncle, aunt and father

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
how they let you come here alone

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They didn't

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I came out alone

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What happened?

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's all Zhang Pu's fault

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He encouraged my uncle

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to search for beauties everywhere

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and go to the county

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My uncle too

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He never thought of training the army

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
to make Yanzhou stronger

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But he was so greedy

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He started to go astray

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and they even threw his uncle's face into the water

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have you ever chased Mrs. Yu Lou?

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mrs. Shu?

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't mention it

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Especially in front of your brother-in-law

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
When you get to the mansion

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you should be careful

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Your brother-in-law is old

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and he is always serious

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He is totally different from Wei Shijun

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You should do your best to help him

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't make trouble

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
or he will be bad to you

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I see

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your Highness

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Get up

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you, Your Highness

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mother

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My son

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mother

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you, my son

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Mother

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Mother

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Brother

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where is my mother?

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You want to see your mother, right?

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I will let you see her later

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I will let you see your mother later

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay?

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Go

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Brother

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My father loved you the most

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Pass my order

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Pass my order

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Liu Qi and San Lang

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
will be buried for my father

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your Highness

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My son is innocent

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't bear to leave my brother

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But my mother poisoned my father

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Only this way can save my son

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If General Lin is like me

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can understand my suffering

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
if I lose all my relatives and friends in one night

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It seems that General Lin understands

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In this case

216
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
please send them off for me

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, Your Highness

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Your Highness

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The Luli Conference of Weiguo

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Since they want to invite the King of Liangya to go there in person

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
then as they wish

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Raise me, Liangya Guowei

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Raise me, Liangya Guowei

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have brought you to visit your grandmother and grandmother

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
When you see your brother-in-law later

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I can take you to the clinic

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This sword is from your grandmother

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You must cherish it, do you hear me?

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I like it

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
when you see your brother-in-law later

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
don't make a mistake again

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I made a mistake

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Nanjun

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This is my ID, Qiao Ci

236
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Brother-in-law

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The sword in your hand

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
was taken by the enemy of my grandfather

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and taken from the enemy

240
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You haven't been surprised yet

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
My grandmother gave it to you

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's very important

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Nanjun

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I didn't know this was my grandfather's old item

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
My brother is still young

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He doesn't know how to cherish it

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will send this sword back tomorrow

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Forget it

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let him keep it

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No matter how meaningful the items are

251
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
it's just a broken body

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
if no one uses it

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sit down

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you practice martial arts?

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Since I was eight years old

261
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I must practice for three hours a day

262
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I dare not slack off every day

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I have been practicing martial arts with my grandfather since I was four years old

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I have made some achievements

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I practice for three hours a day

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Brother-in-law taught me

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Do you usually study?

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Father taught us to take care of all schools

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Rumu, Mingfa, Tao, Yin Yang, all have studied

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If you want to take care of all schools

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you can only study these

272
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Farm, tea, novel, zonghe

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
all of these have to be more established

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A-Zi, why don't you serve tea to your brother-in-law?

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Nanjun has said so much

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He must be thirsty

278
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A-Zi brought this from Yanzhou

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Brother-in-law, please

280
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Nanjun must be very tired from the pressure

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
so he can't even lift his arms

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Brother-in-law, please

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You still have to practice martial arts

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You can't even lift a tea bowl

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Brother-in-law taught me

286
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Nanjun, it's getting late

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I will take A-Zi to the clinic

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Go

289
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Go

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Thank you, Marquis Wei

291
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This jade pendant has been with me for many years

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I finally have a good sleep after wearing it today

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I will definitely give you an explanation

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's good that Qiao Ci came to the jade pendant

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Qiao Ci came?

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He still dares to come?

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He must not know that I came to the jade pendant

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Forget it

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Now even if it's face to face

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
he will not admit it

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He will even say that he has never seen it

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Yulou

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I will definitely give you an explanation

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Zhong Lin, I chase you for my own good

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But this matter may cause you and your wife to have a problem

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't want to cause trouble again

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's just forget about this matter

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Nanjun, the female army is here

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I will go to the palace to see her

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I will wait for you

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I will wait for you

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Nanjun, the female army is here

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Please come in

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yes

315
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Zhong Lin, although sister is from Yanzhou

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but this matter, whether it's Qiao Yu or Qiao Ci

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
sister must still not know

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You don't have to be modest to her

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Give it to her

320
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I came in a hurry

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I haven't seen my sister

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't mind it

323
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Mrs. Yulou, why are you so polite?

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
To be honest, Ci also came to the jade pendant

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I just found out what happened in Yanzhou

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ci and uncle have offended Mrs. Yulou

327
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I am also afraid and uneasy

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But I have already taught Ci a lesson

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He knows he is wrong

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He really knows he is wrong?

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ci wants to apologize to Mrs. Yulou in person

332
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know if there is a chance

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If it can be a front line, it is the best

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you think, Nanjun?

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If he has a chance, it is the best

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Master, please bring someone here

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Apologize

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Mrs. Yulou, I am sorry

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I know

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You just followed your uncle's order

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's not your fault

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I am sorry

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I am sorry

344
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I am sorry

345
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I am sorry

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I am sorry

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I love you

348
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Mrs. Yulou

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He is not our little boy

350
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
When the boy was moving the luggage for Mrs. Yulou

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
he was so tired of these jewelry

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I brought him here to apologize to Mrs. Yulou

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I see

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Since the day Kang Jun escaped

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
you have been looking at the body in the dark

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You only feel that the body is different from the other

357
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Mrs. Yulou said that

358
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ci's body is similar to the boy's

359
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I also didn't see it clearly when he was wearing the armor

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
How do you know that the person who raped you is Ci?

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He said it himself

362
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:15,940
Is his voice a

363
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't believe it

364
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If it was Ci

365
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I would bring him here to apologize to Mrs. Yulou

366
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But if he didn't

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I wouldn't let him make a mistake

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Forget it

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You are so stubborn

370
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You keep chasing me

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You won't believe me

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You are the queen of Weibo

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And now I have Qiu Yu as my queen

374
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have nothing to say

375
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't worry

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I think you are right

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's call Qiao Si in

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We will know

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wei Liang

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Wei Hong

381
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Sister

382
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Mrs. Yulou

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Mrs. Yulou

384
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Do you recognize this time

385
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
On the day of the escape

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yi Qiang was killed

387
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yi Qiang was killed

388
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yi Qiang was killed

389
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yi Qiang was killed

390
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I was so confused

391
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I only remember the words like

392
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Friday

393
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and the word of the nephew

394
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Maybe there is some misunderstanding

395
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's not my fault

396
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But Mrs. Yulou was really shocked

397
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I hope Mrs. Yulou can rest more

398
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
See you soon

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Ci has been tired these days

400
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I took him back to rest

401
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I will visit Mrs. Yulou another day

402
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Mrs. Yulou

403
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So the misunderstanding is solved

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thank you, Wei Hong

405
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
for helping me to investigate

406
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I hope you and sister

407
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
won't have any problems

408
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Women are generous

409
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I won't blame myself

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't blame me

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll go first

412
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You rest well

413
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Sister

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Qiao's sister

415
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
How dare she play tricks on us

416
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Now she is angry

417
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's better to take her back

418
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and win the game

419
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then we can get rid of the shame

420
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Nanjun's knot is untied

421
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Where is Qiao Ci?

422
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I asked her to go back

423
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll take Qiao Ci to the school

424
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
to see how she is doing

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't you blame me

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
for being reckless

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and only listen to your family's advice?

428
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Nanjun's misunderstanding is deep

429
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's normal for him to react like this

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Nanjun never angry with me

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why should I blame Nanjun?

432
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Come, eat something

433
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Shi Jun

434
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Shi Jun, it's been a long time

435
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You haven't come for a long time

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why is there a young man?

437
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Come, Shi Yi

438
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Come, come

439
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Come

440
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Come

441
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Come

442
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Come

443
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Come

444
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Come

445
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Come

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Come

447
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Come

448
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Come

449
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
She is still young

450
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We just come to drink

451
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You can all go down first

452
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's go

453
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Come

454
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Uncle

455
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm still a little uncomfortable

456
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Besides, if sister knows

457
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
she won't bother me

458
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'd better go back first

459
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
See you later

460
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Go down

461
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Don't go

462
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Go

463
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Come back

464
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What are you doing here?

465
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Sister punished me to be here for two hours

466
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There are no people around

467
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Why are you standing so late?

468
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Punishment is punishment

469
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Of course you can't relax

470
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You are serious

471
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But why did you

472
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
make trouble with her?

473
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I dare not make trouble with her

474
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What did you do?

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I didn't do anything

476
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I just wanted to ask you

477
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What did you do wrong?

478
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Wei Biaocheng took me to Luo Zhongfang

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Sister knew it

480
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Wei Biaocheng couldn't save me this time

481
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He almost got punished by sister

482
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Come, take it

483
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You

484
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Come in with me

485
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'll listen to you

486
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He gave me face

487
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
He let you go

488
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Brother-in-law, don't lie to me

489
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'm a duke

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I won't lie to you

491
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Sit down

492
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Nanjun

493
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You go out first

494
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes

495
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Get down

496
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Ah Ci

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
went to Luo Zhongfang

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and drank a few drinks

499
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's a small thing

500
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Don't be angry

501
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He just came to Yujun

502
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's normal for him to go to Luo Zhongfang

503
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
to show off his gold

504
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's normal

505
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It seems that Nanjun

506
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
is also a regular guest of Luo Zhongfang

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
He is a friend of the same path

508
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
so he helped him out

509
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
How can I help him?

510
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I never go

511
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I only went to the same place

512
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
twice as Biaocheng

513
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
once

514
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So it's once or twice?

515
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Kneel down

516
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You are young

517
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You dare to go to

518
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the place where there is a lot of blood

519
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When you grow up

520
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you will have no choice

521
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Go to the place where there is a lot of blood

522
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
when you grow up

523
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and tell your sister

524
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You are so rude

525
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Say thanks to your sister

526
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hurry up

527
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Sister

528
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Sister

529
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm wrong, sister

530
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sister

531
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Enough

532
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I have needles in my hand

533
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yes

534
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Ah Ci knows he is wrong

535
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He won't be angry again

536
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Don't be angry

537
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yes, sister

538
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I will never go again

539
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I won't go even if my brother-in-law calls me

540
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I can't go

541
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
What a joke

542
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Ok, don't be angry

543
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I will tell you

544
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
something that will make you happy

545
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Look at this

546
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Look at this

547
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Get up

548
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Now

549
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's too late to send a letter to Sister Bi Zhi

550
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So I decide

551
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
to let Ah Ci represent Yan Zhou

552
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to attend the party this time

553
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Really, brother-in-law?

554
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

555
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

556
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Ok

557
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
From today

558
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I will read your book and dance every day

559
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Of course, it's convenient for your sister

560
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to teach you strictly

561
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
From tomorrow

562
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you will move to the house officially

563
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank you, brother-in-law

564
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Grow up

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Ok

566
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Fan

567
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What's wrong?

568
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's been a few days since the party started

569
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We haven't received the invitation from Weiguo

570
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Wait a minute

571
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Maybe we are delayed on the way

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Report

573
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
General

574
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We got a letter from Weiguo

575
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's raining a lot today

576
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and the road is muddy

577
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So we arrived two days late

578
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Go

579
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Look

580
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I told you

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We must be delayed on the way

582
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm sorry

583
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
In a few days

584
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you can find someone

585
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to send mother back to Kang County

586
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Back to Kang County?

587
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Not to Yujun?

588
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Manman is doing well in Yujun

589
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We don't need to visit him

590
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm sorry

591
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Are you tired?

592
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Sister

593
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Why is it so heavy?

594
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I live in a house with mud and stones

595
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's practical

596
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I just admire you

597
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I just thought you were taller a few days ago

598
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I didn't expect you to grow taller

599
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
My father never gave me any training

600
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Is it wrong to train in this yard?

601
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's ok

602
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This is not my home after all

603
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sister

604
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I was just worried about you

605
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So I came to visit him

606
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Now you think too much for me

607
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Are you relieved to see me now?

608
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm not relieved to see brother-in-law like that

609
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Your brother-in-law is a little awkward

610
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But he is not bad

611
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But I'm also a good brother-in-law

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You always praise him

613
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I didn't feel it

614
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You know the grudge between the two families

615
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You know the grudge between the two families

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He has been the master since childhood

617
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's not easy

618
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No one can say what they want

619
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But he is actually considerate and gentle

620
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Once he trusts someone

621
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
He will take care of him

622
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And trust him more

623
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Brother-in-law

624
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
He still doesn't see me as his own person

625
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He cares about you

626
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But he doesn't know how to express

627
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I think he needs to destroy the whole family

628
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Then he will get depressed

629
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The family won't accept your care

630
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
freshman

631
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
sided

632
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Purchase the gift

633
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
buy, pick up

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You must buy shocked

635
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Prince turnover

636
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's going to get started

637
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Why is Prince of Liangya not here yet?

638
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,180
Liangyabo has always been

639
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

640
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

641
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
You two have been bowing to me.

642
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,000
You came to Yu County without any reason.

643
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
It's all because of your love for your grandfather.

644
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,200
We've been friends for ten years.

645
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,800
You even pulled my beard when we were young.

646
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
You don't have to be polite to us.

647
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Just say what you want.

648
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,600
It's a pity that you left in a hurry.

649
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,200
You didn't even see the last time.

650
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
Why are you saying these things?

651
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You're making me sad.

652
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,200
It's Prince Liu.

653
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
Lord Liangya sent a prince here

654
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,600
to save the reputation of Wei State.

655
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
That's right.

656
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,400
Lord Liangya came to the meeting

657
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,800
and Lord Liangya is dead.

658
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,000
Princess Consort and all her children

659
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,800
are deeply in love with Lord Liangya.

660
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,400
They want to follow him and leave with the late king.

661
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Yi Hong, this is too sudden.

662
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Why is this so sudden?

663
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Little sister, it's been a long time.

664
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,400
How is Lord Liangya?

665
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm sorry.

666
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm sorry.

667
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm sorry.

668
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
I'm sorry.

670
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm sorry.

678
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
I'm sorry.

679
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,860
wrong

680
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,900
Madam from the imperial family arrives.

681
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,800
Madam from the imperial family?

682
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,000
The Minister Zhen of the маленьé village.

683
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
Chen Pang is in charge of the pipeline.

684
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Why would he come?

685
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm here to meet you.

686
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Madam Yulou, please have a seat.

687
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Your Highness,

688
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
this Madam Yulou's forehead

689
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
is covered with peony flowers.

690
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Rumors spread in the room.

691
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I heard that

692
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
she could be a ghost.

693
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm afraid she's not a ghost.

694
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't know if she's a god.

695
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
If she's really a god,

696
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
can she be a ghost?

697
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Today, the people who came here

698
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
are all the people of each country.

699
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The Zushi's ghost

700
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
can create a name card for Wushan State.

701
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We can work together.

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm afraid her ability

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
is not on a flower.

704
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You're right.

705
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Wushan State

706
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
An Si,

707
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
there are many skilled people today.

708
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We'll be able to do well later.

709
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Don't worry.

710
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's a competition.

711
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We'll do our best.

712
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We won't lose to anyone.

713
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Wushan State

714
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The time is now.

715
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The match is about to start.

716
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The first round is

717
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
the battle of tears.

718
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The winner is Li Kui.

719
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
He'll be given a treasured gift.

720
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Please welcome

721
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
the warriors of Yanzhou

722
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and the warriors of Yaozhou.

723
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The first round is over.

724
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The battle between Yanzhou and Yaozhou

725
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
is about to start.

726
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Which one do you want?

727
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Come on.

728
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Come on.

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Come on.

730
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What are you doing?

731
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Don't hesitate.

732
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Come on.

733
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The message has been sent.

734
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The result is in the press conference.

735
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The warriors of each country

736
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
are all good.

737
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's a blind guess.

738
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The fool is too poor.

739
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The fool won't go again.

740
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Hurry up.

741
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The battle between Yanzhou and Yaozhou

742
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
is about to start.

743
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Hurry up.

744
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Why is nobody pressing Yanzhou?

745
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The young man of Yanzhou

746
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
is just in his prime.

747
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What's his skill?

748
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Pressuring him is a waste of money.

749
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yanzhou is gone.

750
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's not a shame

751
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
to lose to a kid

752
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
who comes to Weiguo.

753
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You know nothing.

754
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
He is young,

755
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
but he is talented.

756
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
He is good at shooting.

757
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But he didn't bring weapons.

758
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He didn't fight.

759
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
He just found an excuse.

760
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
He even cut the ice.

761
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
