00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're really a lady of the brothel.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're so noble.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Madam Yu Lou.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My family name is Su.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My son's name is Xing.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm Wei Liang.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
General Wei Qu.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Greetings, General Xiang Rui.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Greetings, General.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm afraid that I can't catch up

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
with my grandma's 60th birthday.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm in a hurry

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and I'm afraid I'll cause you trouble.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't expect that

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
General Wei Qu

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
would come to welcome me from the city.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm really sorry.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Madam Yu Lou.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're really a lady of the brothel.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's getting late.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll take Madam to the city.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This car is really nice.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who's in the carriage?

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is Madam Yu Lou's car.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it the legendary Madam Yu Lou?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The one with the peony flower on her head.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Su from Wushan State.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Her name is Ming Ge.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
She's a natural lady.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No wonder the two generals

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
came to welcome her in person.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
She's really a beauty.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She's so beautiful.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
People imitate her

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but she's not even one of them.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Many people believe in fate.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But some people understand

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that there's nothing

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that can be done in this world.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Even if the heaven gives you a chance,

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you have to work hard.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What I've got today

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is not easy.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
People are stupid.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They want to add a flower shop

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to get your peony.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But they don't know that the fate is hard to change.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You've been carrying the fate of the Su family of Wushan State

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and you've been taught by the Ming family.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You have extraordinary eyes.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How can you compare to other common women?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can't say that.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If this trip

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
doesn't break up the Qiao Wei Alliance,

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
then in your brother-in-law's eyes,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm no different from these common women.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He also stopped

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
electronic data.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,820
So we've been

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,000
fond of these describe this place.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,200
This is the place Wei He arranged for us?

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,920
Yes.

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
This is the best inn in our local area.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Are you not satisfied, Madam Yulu?

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
How could I?

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
This is a quiet place.

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
It's exactly what I want.

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Wei He is thoughtful.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
He doesn't say that you are tired.

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
You can rest in the inn first.

80
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
You must come to the inn.

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
No.

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Didn't Sister say that

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Wei He would arrange for us to live in the inn?

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Why is it a inn?

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
It must be Qiang Yu's idea.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
The most beautiful flower shop.

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
It's guaranteed to bloom one day.

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
The third day of marriage will arrive.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
You can enjoy the beautiful scenery for ten days.

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Gentlemen,

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I came here to give this to Madam.

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
This is a fish-shaped cake.

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
It's the most fashionable dress of the world.

94
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
It's not necessary for a girl to be happy.

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's go.

96
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
The most fashionable one.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Give me one.

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Okay.

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
How much is it?

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Three yuan.

101
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
You really believe the words of the shopkeeper.

102
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
This is not what Xiao Tao wants.

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
She can't like it.

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
It's not for Xiao Tao.

106
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I can't paste it myself.

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
What's wrong, Brother Dong?

108
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'll give you this.

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Why do you have this too?

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Now the girls in the fish-shaped shop

111
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
like these flower shop decorations.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I bought it for you when I brought Madam Yu Lou back.

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Now girls like this.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Who likes it?

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
This kind of girl.

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Who wants it?

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Okay.

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Okay.

119
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Don't pick it up.

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Okay.

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I won't pick it up.

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
If you don't want it, then I won't.

123
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Why are you so angry?

124
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
What do you know?

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll ask you something.

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
Tell me the truth.

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I heard that Madam Yu Lou had a relationship with Wei family.

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Is it true?

129
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
It's true.

130
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Do you like it or not?

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Madam.

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Madam Yu Lou is here to see you.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Ask her in.

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes.

135
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
And ask all the maids to come and see the guests.

136
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Yes.

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Grandma has a guest.

138
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll leave first.

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Okay.

140
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I'll go now.

141
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Okay.

142
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Bye.

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Bye.

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Bye.

145
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Bye.

146
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Bye.

147
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Bye.

148
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Bye.

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Bye.

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll leave first.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
You stay.

152
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
It's okay.

153
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
According to the background,

154
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
she should call me grandma.

155
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
When she was young,

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
she was very close to me.

157
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Okay.

158
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm here to see grandma.

159
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
My grandchildren, E Huang,

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
greet grandma.

161
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Please rise.

162
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Take a seat.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
And you're here.

164
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,040
I heard your husband is badly ill

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,560
and I just came on the birthday.

166
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,920
You came all the way across the city for you.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,640
Aunt.

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
Although E lightly is ruling the country as her army,

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,440
he always quivers

170
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
and cracks signs during grief.

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
When the time comes,

172
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,480
my aunt

173
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
loves E very much.

174
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
This year, she is also 他心悵心切

175
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,800
so came here

176
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm sorry

177
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,040
for disturbing your mother.

178
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
If you want to relax,

179
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,600
you can stay here.

180
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,120
Thank you, Grandmother.

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,120
This is Mrs. Zhong Lin, Qiao.

182
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,400
She's very considerate.

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
I've heard that

184
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,200
you have a beautiful face.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,680
You look so beautiful today.

186
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,680
You were just talking to your grandmother.

187
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,960
It's my fault.

188
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
I'm sorry for my sister.

189
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,560
If I have a chance,

190
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,720
I hope to see you more often

191
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
so that I won't be disappointed.

192
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm glad to see you.

193
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm very happy.

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,880
You don't have to be.

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
I grew up with Marquis Yitong.

196
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
You can call me Sister.

197
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,960
You're married to a woman from a far away country.

198
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,880
You're the Queen of the country.

199
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I'm young.

200
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
I dare not break the rules.

201
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,960
I'd rather call you Mrs. Yu Lou.

202
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,000
Sister Budi,

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
you're a noble person.

204
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
You're a wise man.

205
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,240
You're a great man.

206
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm sorry for my bad words.

207
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Please forgive me.

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
Great Madam,

209
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
Madam is here.

210
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,120
Greetings, Madam.

211
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,280
E'huang, it's been a long time.

212
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,880
You're getting more and more handsome.

213
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
This is what a woman should look like.

214
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Thank you, Madam.

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
I didn't expect to see you again

216
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,160
after we parted.

217
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
It's been a long time.

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
You've always treated me like your daughter.

219
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
I've been through a lot in Bianzhou.

220
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,960
I couldn't help it.

221
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,560
I was forced to do so.

222
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,520
Why did you butt-act then?

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,660
I couldn't help myself.

224
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Please don't speak less.

225
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,920
I've been staring at her.

226
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,720
I've almost forgotten her.

227
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,280
Madam,

228
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,240
I heard that Rong Jun was exhibits anxiety,

229
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,640
so I brought you some grains.

230
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,040
I brought them over

231
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,840
as a courtesy.

232
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,240
Please rest assured.

233
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,000
since we grew up together.

234
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,640
E'Huang,

235
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,080
you've been thinking about Zhong Lin.

236
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,360
You've been through a lot.

237
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
You're a family.

238
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
Don't say those things.

239
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,800
Grandma must be tired.

240
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
I'll go back first

241
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
and serve her another day.

242
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,920
You're thoughtful.

243
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,600
Finish your work.

244
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,000
And you guys have a rest.

245
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,320
Yes.

246
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,800
Great Madam,

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,360
Madam Amulet

248
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,960
seemed to be more while and stunning than before.

249
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
Despite being known as a ch modsdoor in the border PC combination.

250
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,120
She doesn't live well.

251
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,520
Before, he was so ungrateful to Nan Jun

252
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,160
He thought he wanted to marry Nan Jun

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,680
But he married to Dan Jun after the New Capital Ceremony

254
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,040
He was also thinking for his future

255
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,080
He had no choice

256
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,120
I don't think we are meant to be

257
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,480
I think Marquis Wei's new wife is very capable

258
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,160
You have been working so hard

259
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
You finally have a chance to enjoy your life

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
A chance?

261
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
I don't have that chance

262
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,560
I just hope that this pretty girl can let me live a peaceful life

263
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,800
That's enough

264
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,640
Why do you say that?

265
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,880
I saw that my grandmother was very fond of her

266
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,400
I thought...

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
You just came here for a day

268
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,680
Do you know what kind of life I usually have?

269
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,960
My grandmother is always strong

270
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,600
But that pretty girl is so weak

271
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
She always coaxes Zhong Lin

272
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
She drove Chu Yun out of the house

273
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,960
Now they are both loyal

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm the only one in the family

275
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,840
Why didn't Zhong Lin help you?

276
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,040
What?

277
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,920
Zhong Lin is busy

278
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,880
He was busy with the divorce

279
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,520
And then he was busy with the marriage

280
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,480
I can't help him with these things

281
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,600
I can't give him any trouble

282
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,920
As a mother, I should consider it

283
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,360
No one else can help me

284
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,240
Of course

285
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,120
You know me best

286
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,360
If you can stay in the mansion for a few more days

287
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
I can talk to him

288
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,080
You just said that Marquis Wei was busy with the marriage

289
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,880
But I think that Xindu and Pan Yi just entered the palace

290
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,600
Why are they so anxious to marry the same man as Rongjing?

291
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,480
What difficulties did they encounter?

292
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,600
Maybe I can help them

293
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
I heard that Rongjing was in a drought

294
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,880
And Yanzhou wants to send a batch of wheat seeds there

295
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,360
So they have to marry the same man

296
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,160
Why can women help us with these things?

297
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,360
I can meet you in Yashu with my wife

298
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,720
But Madam Yulou insists on coming here

299
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,480
It's okay

300
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,040
Madam Yulou

301
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,280
It's good to see you

302
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
Do you remember?

303
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,000
Back then, you and I and Duke Bo

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
We often played in the courtyard

305
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
We were carefree

306
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,160
Now we have been apart for many years

307
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,800
The courtyard is in ruins

308
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,880
But everything is as good as yesterday

309
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,040
Yes, it's as good as yesterday

310
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,480
Although I was born in Wushan

311
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,720
I spent the happiest time of my childhood with you

312
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,760
Now I'm back to Weiguo

313
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,560
It's like I'm back to my hometown

314
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,520
Weiguo is really the second hometown of Madam Yulou

315
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,400
When I came here that day

316
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,120
I knew that my grandmother was healthy

317
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,720
The family business was well-organized

318
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,760
It's all because of you

319
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
You are so kind and considerate

320
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,840
You can give me a good life

321
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,400
I can't give you a good life

322
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,920
Yes, it's hard for her

323
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,880
Not only hard

324
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,680
I feel sorry for her

325
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,400
I heard that you are very fond of your family

326
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,320
You never care about your family business

327
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,840
Now you are here

328
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,400
But you have to work so hard

329
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,320
Zhong Lin, I have something to tell you

330
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,560
You are doing things for the family

331
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,200
The Qiao family and the Wei family are separated by grudges

332
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
It's complicated

333
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,680
You don't have to worry about it

334
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,280
I've been thinking these days

335
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Madam Yulou has never waited for us for so many years

336
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,160
Why is she here now?

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Can you make it clearer?

338
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,840
She came here with food

339
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,160
She must have prepared it

340
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,200
But I have asked my uncle for the seed

341
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,920
If Nanjun takes her food

342
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,880
Where will we put Yanzhou's face?

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,320
I know that you are suffering from drought

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,440
Yanzhou is sent from the source of wheat seeds

345
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,200
It should be your sister to slow down the relationship with the two families

346
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,760
But it's hard to guarantee that the Qiao family will be heartbroken

347
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,520
I am here not only to help my grandmother and grandmother

348
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,840
But also to help the Wei family

349
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,680
I brought the food here on purpose

350
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,800
It can help Rong Jun to calm the drought

351
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,600
This batch of food is not from Wushan

352
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
Nor from Bianzhou

353
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,200
It's just my personal opinion

354
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Don't worry about it

355
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,120
Once Yanzhou and Weiguo join hands to get Rong Jun

356
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,240
It will certainly form a encirclement of Bianzhou

357
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
How could they sit and do nothing?

358
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,040
So this Chen Xiang asked Madam Yulou to be the tax collector

359
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,680
In order not to let Weiguo join Rong Jun

360
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Xiu Xu is the official of Weiguo

361
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,840
Now Madam Yulou is the female emperor of Bianzhou

362
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,120
It's not convenient for you and me to discuss the matter

363
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
I can't accept the food

364
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,360
Rong Jun and Han Zai have already helped each other

365
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,960
Not to mention that the Qiao family is allied

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
I can't be suspicious

367
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,840
Yes

368
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,200
It's my personal opinion

369
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
I'll go first

370
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Zhong Lin

371
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
Wei Liang

372
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
He humiliated me with this thing

373
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:41,360
No

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Why are you still smiling, My lord

375
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,040
Your Majesty.

376
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,080
I'm done.

377
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
Back then,

378
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,040
we couldn't fight

379
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,560
your old lover.

380
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
The following year,

381
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,480
I sent a letter

382
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I was young at that time.

383
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
It's not what I want.

384
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
I was forced to...

385
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Don't mention the past.

386
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Now,

387
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I'm sorry to let you down.

388
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Nanjun.

390
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Nanjun.

391
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Nanjun.

392
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
So you like this.

393
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I'll take you to the street

394
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
to buy more clothes.

395
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Nanjun is busy every day.

396
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
How can I bother him to worry about me?

397
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Besides,

398
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
I've hated this kind of

399
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
fancy clothes since I was a kid.

400
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Yuan Nanjun, please.

401
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
No need.

402
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
You can go.

403
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Yes.

404
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
The King's Secret

405
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
This is a free meal for him.

406
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
The Marquis doesn't want to accept it?

407
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
He's fond of

408
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
my status as the female monarch of Bianzhou.

409
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
He's deliberately to make friends with me.

410
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
The Qiao family of Bianzhou

411
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
celebrates the birthday of the Great Madam.

412
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
They're here to sell the rice.

413
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Since the Marquis

414
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
remembers my status,

415
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Sister,

416
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
how should you use your skills in the future?

417
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
If I can't use my skills,

418
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
the Qiao family is the enemy.

419
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
It's even more difficult for him to use his skills.

420
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
The Marquis remembers the past

421
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
and also remembers the enemy.

422
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I was married to the Wei family.

423
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
If it weren't for the late Mr. Qiao,

424
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
the Wei family would have been in a sudden change.

425
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
The Wei family would have been in a sudden change.

426
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
The Duke...

427
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
The Su family

428
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
will not change me.

429
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I haven't forgotten this grudge.

430
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
I can't forget the Marquis.

431
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
In that case,

432
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Sister,

433
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
what should we do in the future?

434
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Since the marriage is for

435
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
the wheat seedlings,

436
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
the Marquis refused my food

437
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
for the wheat seedlings.

438
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
If something happens to the wheat seedlings...

439
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
Don't forget.

440
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
We still have a secret plan.

441
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Thank you, Brother.

442
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
You're welcome.

443
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm grateful to the people of the Marquis

444
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
for supporting the wheat seedlings in Yan.

445
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
It's my pleasure.

446
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Brother, the wheat seedlings are ready.

447
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Please have a look.

448
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Make sure to watch closely.

449
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Yes.

450
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
You're indeed a person

451
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
who came from the Marquis's mansion.

452
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
If you change into some good clothes,

453
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
your figure and appearance

454
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
will be like a lady.

455
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
What a pity.

456
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I didn't mean to offend you.

458
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm new to the army.

459
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I don't know the way.

460
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
I'd like to ask you

461
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
for a favor.

462
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Please go ahead.

463
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Do you know

464
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
how to get to the Marquis's mansion?

465
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
The Marquis's mansion?

466
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
I don't know.

467
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm afraid that

468
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
you can't get there.

469
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm afraid that

470
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
you can't get there.

471
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm afraid that

472
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
you can't get there.

473
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
You're going to look for the Marquis?

474
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Yes.

475
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Who are you?

476
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
To answer your question,

477
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
this man

478
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
is the young master of the Su family of Wushan State.

479
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
I heard that the Great Madam of the Marquis's mansion

480
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
celebrated her birthday.

481
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
I came to congratulate you.

482
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
It's you.

483
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm Su Xin,

484
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
my son.

485
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I saw that you were proud and proud.

486
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
I wonder

487
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
which vile Fu family

488
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
you let live alone outside.

489
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
It's not far from the Marquis's mansion.

490
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
It just takes a few weeks.

491
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
If you don't mind,

492
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
can you take me home to change clothes

493
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
and take care of me in person?

494
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I can't ask for it.

495
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Take this umbrella back.

496
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Thank you, young master.

497
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Sister,

498
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I've done it.

499
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Chu Yu was beaten by the Pu family?

500
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Take her to the house.

501
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
I'll ask her.

502
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
But the Great Madam of the Marquis

503
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
doesn't allow Chu Yu to enter the house.

504
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Take her to the house.

505
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
Don't let the old madam know about it.

506
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
I'll go right now.

507
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Where is Hong Mu going this early in the morning?

508
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Yu Jun.

509
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Yu Jun.

510
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
The list of guests has come out.

511
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
You don't have to ask the madam.

512
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Yu Jun.

513
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Here are Yu Jun's birthday party's ceremony records.

514
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
The list of guests of the ancestral home

515
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
and some family gatherings

516
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
are all valid.

517
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I'll go now.

518
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I'll go now.

519
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
I'll go now.

520
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I'll go now.

521
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I'll go now.

522
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
The list of guests of the ancestral home

523
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
and some family gatherings

524
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
are all valid.

525
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
You're considerate.

526
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
Can I take these back?

527
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Of course.

528
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
But you don't have to take them back.

529
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
The Lord said that the study is reserved for you.

530
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
If you need any books,

531
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
just ask the slave.

532
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
The Lord prepared this?

533
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Yes.

534
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
What does the Lord mean?

535
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
He might be afraid that

536
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I'll ruin the birthday party

537
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
and embarrass him.

538
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
But will the Lord

539
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
really think for the sake of the Lord?

540
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Chu Yu.

541
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Let me see.

542
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
Madam.

543
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Please save Chu Yu.

544
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
Get up.

545
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
What's wrong with your face?

546
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Get up.

547
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Madam.

548
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
She's afraid that I'll be in a bad situation

549
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
with a stranger.

550
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
In fact, she's a gambler

551
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
and she's trying to get money

552
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
from me.

553
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Madam.

554
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
She doesn't want to hear it from me.

555
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm in a bad situation.

556
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Actually,

557
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
she's having a hard time.

558
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
If it weren't for Qiao Nu,

559
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
she would have been happy.

560
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
It seems that

561
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
if we want to do this,

562
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
we need Qiao Nu to show her true colors.

563
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
So I can talk to her.

564
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
I have to make a decision.

565
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
How can I

566
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
be with my great-grandmother?

567
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
I have a way.

568
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
It depends on my will.

569
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

570
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
There's nothing wrong with the warehouse today.

571
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Everything is as usual.

572
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Please rest assured.

573
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Yes.

574
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Sister, it's done.

575
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
It's such a big birthday.

576
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
It must be lively.

577
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I heard that

578
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Madam Yulou is good at music.

579
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Are you lucky

580
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
to have a earful today?

581
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
I heard it before.

582
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
You can ask her.

583
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
It's because

584
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Madam Yulou is noble

585
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
and she's a good girl.

586
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I heard that

587
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
she's a good girl.

588
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
I heard that

589
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
she's a good girl.

590
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
I heard that

591
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
she's a good girl.

592
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I heard that

593
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Madam Yulou is noble

594
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
and she's a good girl.

595
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
How can you make fun of her?

596
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I just want to

597
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
use Madam Yulou's singing

598
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
to show my true colors.

599
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
How are you going

600
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
to show me your true colors?

601
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
How about

602
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I show you my sword?

603
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
I can sing for you.

604
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
How about that?

605
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Great.

606
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Great.

607
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Great.

608
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
The grass in the spring

609
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,480
is green and the old trees are in full bloom

610
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I only doubt that

611
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
the spring will be full of laughter

612
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
The grass in the spring

613
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
is green and the old trees are in full bloom

614
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
I only doubt that

615
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,480
the spring will be full of laughter

616
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Great.

617
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
That's great.

618
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Great.

619
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Wei Shijing is so brilliant.

620
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
He's so talented.

621
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
If he's on the battlefield,

622
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
he must be a great general.

623
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
He's so talented.

624
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Thank you, Grandmother.

625
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Grandmother,

626
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
although you're in the East Sea,

627
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
you're still healthy

628
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
and happy.

629
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm happy.

630
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
I'm so happy today.

631
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
It's a good thing.

632
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I've given you

633
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
your favorite gift.

634
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I heard that

635
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
there's a gift for you in Yanzhou.

636
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
You've seen it before.

637
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Yanzhou has sent me

638
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
the seed of wheat.

639
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Is it just a seed?

640
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
The seed is the foundation

641
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
of Yanzhou's wealth.

642
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
It can be given with this.

643
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
This sincerity

644
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
is the biggest gift

645
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,480
you've ever given me.

646
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
It's just that the seed

647
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,480
is so rare.

648
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
You may not be interested

649
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
in these things.

650
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Zhong Lin, you're...

651
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
I...

652
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
You're just guessing, right?

653
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Go ahead.

654
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
This kid.

655
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Grandmother, actually,

656
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
I'm not trying to be a child.

657
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I'm just curious.

658
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Why don't we

659
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
let Qiao Nu

660
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
take out the seed

661
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
and let everyone

662
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
know about it?

663
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Right?

664
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Yes.

665
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Great.

666
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Take it out.

667
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
We should know about it.

668
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Yes.

669
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Grandmother, grandmother,

670
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
this is the seed from Yanzhou.

671
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Please check it.

672
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Actually, the seed

673
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
is a improved seed.

674
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
It was planted in the autumn.

675
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
It can be harvested in May.

676
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
It's been harvested in the autumn.

677
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,480
It's been harvested in the autumn.

678
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,480
But the seed

679
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
is unique in Yanzhou.

680
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Yanzhou produces and sells seed.

681
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
But it never gives seed.

682
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
This time,

683
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
we're going to share the seed

684
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
with grandmother's birthday.

685
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Yanzhou is willing to

686
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
share the seed with the country.

687
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
What's this smell?

688
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Is it mold?

689
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Yes.

690
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
How dare you!

691
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
I want to ask you

692
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
what's on your mind.

693
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
14 years ago,

694
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,480
the battle was destroyed.

695
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
It's not bad enough

696
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
to destroy our family.

697
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
You took these seeds

698
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
and came here to take them out.

699
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
Take them away.

700
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Take them away.

701
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Grandmother,

702
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
the seed we sent this time

703
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
was tested by my daughter-in-law.

704
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Each seed was carefully selected.

705
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
And this time,

706
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
it's about the alliance between the two families.

707
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
It's also about the people's livelihood.

708
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
The Qiao family

709
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
will not joke about this kind of thing.

710
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
And in my opinion,

711
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
the seed is full.

712
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
It's not bad.

713
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Although the seed is not rotten,

714
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,480
it's still ripe.

715
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
It's ripe.

716
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
It's ripe.

717
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
The seed is ripe.

718
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
It's ripe.

719
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
It's really ripe.

720
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
It's ripe.

721
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
It's ripe.

722
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
It's ripe.

723
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
How can the seed be seeded?

724
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Let me see.

725
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
The seed is hard to grow.

726
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
If the people

727
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
work hard to sow seeds,

728
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
the seed will not sprout.

729
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
People must think

730
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
that they are not careful enough

731
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
to serve the family.

732
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
So they miss the seeding technique.

733
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,480
The rye is worse than this year.

734
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
People's will is the best.

735
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Everyone,

736
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
how much hatred is this?

737
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
What's the meaning of this?

738
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
It's not good for the people.

739
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
It's a new kind of seed.

740
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I think Yanzhou is going to

741
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
destroy the people

742
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
by destroying our country.

743
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Today, you must give us an explanation.

744
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
What's going on?

745
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
This seed is the foundation of the country.

746
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
You must give us an explanation.

747
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
They say that the seed in Yanzhou is good.

748
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,480
What if it's good for the people?

749
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Will it be bitter for the people?

750
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
The seed is ripe and drying.

751
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,480
If you don't tell the difference,

752
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
you really don't know the result.

753
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Whether it's true or not,

754
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
you'll know in a moment.

755
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Look.

756
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
It's ripe.

757
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Look.

758
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
It's ripe again.

759
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
That's right.

760
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
It's ripe.

761
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
The seeds are ripe.

762
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
It's impossible.

763
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Your Majesty,

764
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
I don't know.

765
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Your Highness,

766
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,480
uncles,

767
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
although my uncle is confused,

768
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
he has a big attitude.

769
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
He never dares to

770
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
joke about the lives of the people of Wei State.

771
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
There must be a misunderstanding.

772
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Misunderstanding?

773
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Luckily, there's no war.

774
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
If there's a war,

775
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
the grains will be prepared first.

776
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
What will the people eat then?

777
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
What will the soldiers eat?

778
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,480
The Qiao family is very cruel.

779
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
That's right.

780
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
We've been in a state of war for years.

781
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Yujin, what should we do now?

782
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Or I'll go and ask for help.

783
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
I'm a second-in-law of the Wei family.

784
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
The Manchus may not be able to save us.

785
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
If this is the case,

786
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
it will harm the people of Wei State.

787
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
Today,

788
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
you must give us an explanation.

789
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
You must give us an explanation.

790
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
You must give us an explanation.

791
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Yujin is very cautious

792
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
when he comes to Wei State.

793
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Just like me,

794
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
you guys bully a woman.

795
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,480
A woman of a rank,

796
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
what does it have to do

797
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
with the political affairs of the front court?

798
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
I think

799
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
it's Qiao Yue's decision.

800
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Uncle,

801
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
grandma,

802
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
someone is probably

803
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
involved in this.

804
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm here to ask for your help.

805
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
What do you want to do?

806
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
The truth is right in front of you.

807
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
You still want to argue?

808
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
This is not the seed that Yan State sent.

809
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
This is clearly

810
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
from Yan State.

811
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
You still want to argue?

812
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
That's right.

813
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Yan State's scholars brought it here.

814
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
They are wrong.

815
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
The seed is ripe.

816
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
The seed is ripe.

817
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
You're lying to the people.

818
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
You're lying to the people.

819
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
What's the purpose of this?

820
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Grandma, you're talking nonsense.

821
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
How can you be so rude?

822
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Shut up!

823
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Shut up!

824
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
What are you doing?

825
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Now that I realize this...

826
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Since you realize this,

827
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
get your army off the road.

828
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
This Qingcushion

829
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
I found a mysterious case.

830
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,120
I think

831
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,720
someone wants us to be embarrassed.

832
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,040
What's the case?

833
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
It's just that Qiao Nu has a second heart.

834
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,720
She wants to see the bad guys.

835
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,560
She wants us to spread evil rumors

836
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,080
and ignore the lives of the people.

837
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
She's so evil.

838
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,480
Why are you laughing?

839
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm laughing

840
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,760
if you tell me

841
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,960
that Qiao Nu wants to poison my family.

842
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,880
But I don't believe

843
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,480
she'll harm the people.

844
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,400
Get up.

845
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,840
Grandmother.

846
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,880
In the capital,

847
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,320
Qiao Nu ignored her reputation

848
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
and helped us regain the people's trust.

849
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,400
The people of the capital

850
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
willingly took the initiative to spread the rumors.

851
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:53,660
Later, in the

852
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,220
capital,

853
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,420
you can't drink the wine

854
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,660
in the cup

855
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,660
but you don't remember the kindness of others.

856
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,820
If she wants to harm the people,

857
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,580
she doesn't need to be so generous.

858
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,900
As long as she doesn't help me repair the house.

859
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Someone must have

860
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
framed and framed her.

861
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
Are you looking for your master?

862
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,420
What does she have to do with you?

863
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,460
I'm willing to become the government official

864
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,660
for you tonight.

865
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,220
It must have been too heavy

866
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,020
before it postponed or skinned.

867
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,980
Dry pulses

868
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,900
should be lighter than those hard-to-look.

869
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,780
Then give up the food

870
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,420
if it has been relativity.

871
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,860
A couple with a man of the south

872
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,460
will not be assassinated

873
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,700
If the pulse is not the problem before entering the warehouse

874
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,060
it will be the problem after entering the warehouse

875
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,740
I don't know who is responsible for the cold warehouse

876
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,900
Is there another woman

877
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,780
who has a different intention for the south?

878
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,340
According to Mrs. Yulou

879
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,020
it's not you who did it

880
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,460
but Wei Yan did it

881
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,100
It's lively

882
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,140
Master, can you still do it?

883
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,740
Zhi'er

884
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,500
it's not you who did it

885
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,900
nor Wei Yan

886
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,740
You should explain it to your relatives

887
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,820
Yes

888
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,780
You must explain it to us

889
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,860
How can you treat our people like this?

890
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,820
Master, one is a female soldier

891
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,340
and the other is an elder brother

892
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,620
What choice do you make?

893
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,140
Although the army is a guard

894
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,260
but it is not seven brothers

895
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,740
We can't hide from each other

896
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
I'm sorry

897
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm sorry

898
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I'm sorry

899
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
I'm sorry

900
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
I'm sorry

901
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
I'm sorry

902
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
I'm sorry

903
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,700
I'm sorry

904
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
I'm sorry

905
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
I'm sorry

906
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I'm sorry

907
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
I'm sorry

908
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,700
I'm sorry

909
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,700
I'm sorry

910
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,700
I'm sorry

911
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,700
I'm sorry

912
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
I'm sorry

913
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm sorry

914
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,700
I'm sorry

915
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,700
I'm sorry

916
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,700
I'm sorry

917
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,700
I'm sorry

918
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,700
I'm sorry

919
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm sorry

920
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,700
I'm sorry

921
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,700
I'm sorry

I'm sorry

923
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
I'm sorry

924
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,700
I'm sorry

925
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
I'm sorry

926
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I'm sorry

927
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
I'm sorry

928
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm sorry

929
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,860
I'm sorry

930
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860

931
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860

I'm sorry

934
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,860

935
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
I'm sorry

936
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
I'm sorry

937
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
I'm sorry

938
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
I'm so Didn't laugh

939
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
I'm sorry

940
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,860
I'm sorry

941
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,860
I'm sorry

942
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860

943
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,860

00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
I'm so didn't laugh

948
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
I'm so mischevious

949
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
I'm sorry

950
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
I'm sorry

951
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
I'm sorry

952
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
I'm sorry

953
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
I'm sorry

954
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,860
I'm sorry

955
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,860
Even if there's a storm behind me

956
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,860
No matter how much I try, it's just for this missing

957
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:04,860
I won't forget this life

958
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,860
