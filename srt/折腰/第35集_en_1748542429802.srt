00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where is Wei Liang?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Didn't you tell me that he was there?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Look at me, where is Wei Liang?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wei Liang is dead!

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Where is he?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who should die? Why didn't you die?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why didn't you kill him?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wei Xiu!

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Zhuge!

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Report!

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Liu Yan, you led the army to take the memorial tablet

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Pass the order down

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All soldiers, be alert

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Tomorrow, follow me

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to take the memorial tablet

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes, Zhuge

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Zhuge, Zhuge

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let me take him back

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will let Wei Liang go, he will be fine

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I didn't see him

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wei Xiu, calm down

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I found him

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Get up

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Get up

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhuge asked me to take him back

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Get up

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Liu Yan, he will be fine

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will take him back

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Xu Tingliang

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Tomorrow, you take a team of Qu Ping

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to the army

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to find Xiao Li

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and Wei Liang

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and Wei Liang

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to take him back

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
to take him back

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will take him back

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to take him back

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mingzhu!

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mingzhu!

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mingzhu!

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Lie down

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's delicious

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't deserve to blame yourself

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I just hate you

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I can't take these pain for you

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You grew up with Wei Liang

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Although you are not brothers

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you are brothers

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now you are killed by Qiao family

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Even if you die

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
you can't be the last one to die

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I promised you

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
to let Wei family die

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I regretted it

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I let you lose your power

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and Xiao Dao

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I regretted it

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
always wait for Wei Liang

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not your fault

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You are tired

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and this is

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the crime of the contract

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the fire of the eye

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't care about you

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will never

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
let you suffer

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I may...

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't care if you die for Wei Liang

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
or for the people

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You will die for Wei Liang

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
or for the people

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You will die

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't worry

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't blame you

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you, mom

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't help me

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I won't help you

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I promise you

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I won't

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
hurt anyone

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I won't break my promise

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
After I die

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
take care of this family

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and yourself

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Take care of Feifei

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I won't see her

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
when I go out

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's ok

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you...

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I won't see you out

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will be on the way

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
with a bad news

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will be on the way

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't worry

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will be with Wei Xiao

129
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and protect Yu Jun

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will be with Wei Xiao

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You should take care of Madam

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't worry

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ok

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Go

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You should take care of yourself

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't move your baby

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How about Xiao Tao?

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Xiao Tao

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You really want to go to Yan Zhong?

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to go to Zhai Yi Zhong

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Zhai Yi Zhong?

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The real Yan Zhong Lan Cao

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will go with you

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will be your maid

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You are so busy

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Just stand here

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I will ask the master to come out

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and propose to you

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He is a god

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He is afraid that he doesn't deserve you

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So he wants to do more for you

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I am sorry

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then you will come back safe

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I will be blessed by your safety

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Even if I get hurt

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I will come back and propose to your mother

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You will not get hurt

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have a small golden watch

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Every time we go out

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We will leave these little weapons

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I want to give this to you

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When you see it

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You want to see it for real

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
General Wei Liang

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Before I die

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let me

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Give you this Lan Cao

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will not let you be so sad

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let me

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Give you this Lan Cao

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let me

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let me

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will not let you be so sad

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
General Wei Liang

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let me

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He said

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You have to come back to me to propose

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are you doing? Stop fooling me

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He gave me this

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
My mother said

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
She was afraid that I would be wronged

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
She was afraid that I would dislike her

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So she made such a big deal out of it

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
She made me let her make a scene

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was happy

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I am sorry

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Mr. Yang

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How is the situation in the city?

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The security in the city is short-circuited

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The enemy is in a low-key situation

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Pan Yin is now completely in the hands of Liu Yan

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Mr. Yang

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We helped Mr. Qiao to close the door before

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So, can we only pass through the low-key situation now?

197
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How about this

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Mr. Yang

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mrs. Yu Lou has already rebelled against Zhongzhou

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
She took away a major help from Weiguo

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Now, the allies of Wei Shao turn their heads to me

202
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think he has no way to fight against me

203
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But the iron flag of Weiguo is strong

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Even without allies, it is difficult to deal with

205
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In the last battle of Pan Yi

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Liangya was defeated by the iron flag of Weiguo

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Now it is different from the past

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wei Shao must have passed through this place when he led the army

209
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yongning City

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wei Shao built a dam here

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and built a mountain

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
If there is a river and a dam

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
what do you think Wei Shao would do?

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's wonderful

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tang Zhecheng can turn this place into a place to bury Wei Shao

216
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That day, I was defeated by Qiao Shen's sword

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and retreated to the original army

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Today I will make this disgrace a blessing

219
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Who is it?

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Come in and talk

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I came to deliver the military report

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The Wei army has been deployed

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I wonder what your plans are

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You are here

225
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yang Gong, guard the ground of Pan Yi

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and prepare to release anyone at any time

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes, I am ready to deploy at any time

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Not to deploy

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but to destroy

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Destroy the ground?

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's impossible

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I have been busy with the storm recently

233
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If I can't do it

234
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I will be in trouble

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If I destroy the dam now

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I will be in trouble

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If I catch up with the storm

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I will be in trouble

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The Wei...

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No, the Wei army should be alive

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but the people are in danger

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why?

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You are not afraid of a small problem

244
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yang Gong is the father of the king

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why don't you understand this?

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is a small problem

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I understand

248
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I understand

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I am willing to help Zhou Mu and the crown prince

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The dam in the city

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is built by giant stones

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's hard to destroy

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If it is used as a fire source

255
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it will be buried under the heavy wood

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's hard to succeed without the seven-storied tower

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Your Highness

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He is right

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I will go to get the official picture

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will follow the picture and show it to you

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay, go back quickly

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The construction of Yongning Qu is very complicated

264
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Especially from Pan Yi to the part of Xingdu

265
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It took many years

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Now it has penetrated two major rivers

267
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I can't tell

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
whether it is Yangshui or Peishui

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yang Gong has been in charge of Wei for several years

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But can you tell

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
whether you are from Yan or Wei?

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Actually, there is no need to tell

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't think so

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The efforts of Duke Qiao have been accumulated here

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
for the sake of the whole world

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Traffic, trade

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The people are no longer striving to fight for water resources and food

278
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I have seen such a ambition not only from Duke Qiao

279
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but also from Duke Wei

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have seen it too

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I heard that Duke Yang not only built the canal in Pan Yi

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
but also went to Rong County

283
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Pan Yi was not a water city

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but a disaster canal

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thanks to Duke Qiao's reformation of the canal

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
we have what we have today

287
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I just followed Duke Qiao to build these ditches

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have little experience

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to deal with the evil of Yangshui

290
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I know Duke Yang is hard

291
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I will reward you in the future

292
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I just follow the order

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't have any difficulties

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But recently

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I am ashamed of Duke Qiao

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I built the canal for Yan

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I am here today

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
to help Yan get rid of the troubles

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Why should I be ashamed?

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Open the map and act as soon as possible

301
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
OK

302
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There is an assassin

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There is an assassin

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't move

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What are you doing?

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can kill you

307
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But I am ashamed of Duke Qiao

308
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Are you crazy?

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You can live even if you kill me

310
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The dam is destroyed

311
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Pan Yi is gone

312
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's the point of me living alone?

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Let him go

314
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I won't spare you

315
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I can teach him

316
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can teach him

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Your Highness, don't force him

318
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
OK

319
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I am sorry, Duke Qiao

320
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You dare to fight against me?

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You are a traitor

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You will die in my hands

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't worry about Qiao Liu

324
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It has nothing to do with you and A-Ci

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Zhong Lin will handle it

326
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
How is your appetite recently?

327
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Much better

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Great Madam

329
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Great Madam

330
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Great Madam

331
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
General Wei Xiao has an important matter to see you

332
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let him in

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Great Madam, Your Majesty

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The border is reporting

336
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Su Wohuang and Xue Tai lead the army of Zhongzhou

337
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
to attack Yi County

338
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Zhongzhou is also cut off

339
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
How many troops are there in Yi County?

340
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Your Majesty

341
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I have no idea

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How many troops are there in Yi County?

343
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Great Madam

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yi County's chief is more than 60,000

345
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Except the border, there are five thousand troops

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
in Yunzhong and Rong County

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Grandfather

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Sun Xi thinks we should send a meteor horse

349
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to send a letter to the South

350
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
to warn him

351
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and inform the guards at the border

352
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to take care of each other

353
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to support each other

354
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
As you said

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The enemy is fierce

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But we Wei family

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
have been through many battles

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We are the country

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We will pass this level

361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes

362
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
General, wait

363
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Grandmother

364
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The army of the Winged Army is in danger

365
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We should immediately open the gate

366
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to gather the people

367
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to fight against the enemy together

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Anyone who wants to join the army

369
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
can go to the Yashu

370
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
to get the armor and weapons

371
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
At the same time, we should

372
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
open the gate in two days

373
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Let those who want to leave the Winged Army

374
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
can leave on their own

375
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and return to the city when the situation is stable

376
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I will be the first to immigrate

377
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and I will be the one who will serve the family

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
As you wish

379
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
General Wei Xiao

380
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes

381
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Please send both of them

382
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
out of the city

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
for me

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
as soon as possible

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes

386
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Grandmother

387
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Sun Xi can't leave

388
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't leave the Winged Army

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Before the South Army left

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I promised him

391
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Er Xi

393
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The Winged Army is going to be born

394
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Send the imperial doctor

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hurry up

396
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Breathe, breathe

397
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Hurry up

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Madam, please wait

399
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My Lord

400
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Be strong, My Lord

401
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Mother

402
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Don't be nervous

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Relax, relax

404
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Breathe hard

405
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
My Lord, My Lord

406
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
My Lord

407
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Don't be nervous, don't be nervous

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Relax, relax

409
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Be careful

410
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Be careful

411
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Be careful

412
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Be careful

413
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Breathe

414
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's not good

415
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Be strong

416
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Breathe

417
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Be strong

418
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Be strong

419
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Be strong

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Be strong

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Be strong

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Be strong

423
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Come on

424
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
One, two

425
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Be strong

426
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Be strong

427
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Be strong

428
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Look at the head

429
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Look at the head

430
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Be strong

431
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Come out

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Come out

433
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Come out

434
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Come out

435
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Come out

436
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Good job

437
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Congratulations to you

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You got Lin'er

439
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Lin'er

440
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Look

441
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Li Jun, look

442
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's a little Li Jun

443
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Feifei

444
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Great, great

445
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Great, great

446
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Mother and son are safe

447
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thank you

448
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Look at this

449
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
How is it?

450
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It must be hard

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Don't worry

452
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Look

453
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Look at the sweat

454
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Report

455
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The Han army in Yunzhong

456
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
failed to guard the town

457
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
100,000 troops are attacking the fishing village

458
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What should we do?

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Ke'er, pack up

460
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We'll take you to Yunzhong

461
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What should we do?

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What should we do?

463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What should we do?

464
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
What should we do?

465
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Where should we go?

466
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Don't panic

467
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Grandmother

468
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
60,000 people in Nanjing are in the fishing village

469
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
How many soldiers does Li Jun have?

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's a long trip

471
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We've spent a lot of effort

472
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
We don't have many soldiers

473
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Chief Zhen

474
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What should we do?

475
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What should we do?

476
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Good boy

477
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Since Zhong Lin made this arrangement

478
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
he must be sure of victory

479
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Have a good rest

480
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll arrange someone

481
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to send you and Zhu Shi out

482
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I can't go

483
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Grandmother

484
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I promised him before the expedition

485
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I must take care of the family

486
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can't make any mistakes

487
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Grandmother, you are my family

488
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Li Jun is my family

489
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm Li Jun of Wei State

490
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll fight with the people of Li Jun

491
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not leaving

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What are you doing?

493
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to make you happy every day

494
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But I'm too stupid to do it

495
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If I don't leave today

496
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you'll look down on me

497
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I won't leave

498
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes

499
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I have a desire to live

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But my son

501
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
is killed by me

502
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They didn't become soldiers

503
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I won't let them

504
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
to be ashamed of me in this life

505
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Grandmother

506
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
please let me be ashamed

507
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Please

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Look

509
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
This is our Li Jun of Wei State

510
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He's laughing

511
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Master, it's not a mistake

512
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Liu Yan took Pan Yi

513
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and destroyed the dam

514
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yangshui is in danger

515
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He wants to trap us here

516
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and kill us

517
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Anything else?

518
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The intelligence officer said

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Zheng Gong and Yang Gong were killed

520
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and Qiao Yue died

521
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
How many people are left?

522
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Not enough to go

523
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We can't delay it any longer

524
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
We need to go to Pan Yi as soon as possible

525
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and return to Yongning

526
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Report

527
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Master, Madam Yunlong and General Xue Tai

528
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
are all trapped by the 100,000 troops

529
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
They'll break through the gate soon

530
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Please help us

531
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yes

532
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Master

533
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Madam Yunlong and General Xue Tai

534
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
are trapped by the 100,000 troops

535
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
They'll break through the gate soon

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Please help us

537
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Master

538
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Madam Yunlong and General Xue Tai

539
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
are trapped by the 100,000 troops

540
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
If they're broken through

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
they'll be killed

542
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The battle of Xindu 15 years ago

543
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Wei family lost three generations

544
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Today

545
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
will they face the same situation?

546
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Master

548
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Should we send troops to Pan Yi

549
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
or retreat to Yu?

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't want the people of Yan

551
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
to be involved in the battle

552
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't know

553
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
whether to let them down

554
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I don't know what to do

555
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Who knows

556
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Send my order

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
to go to Pan Yi

558
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
to get Yongning

559
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There's no place to lose

561
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If you want to seek shelter

562
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it's useless

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You can go into the Yishi Hall

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and wait

565
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Madam

566
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm here to take part in the war

567
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now the enemy

568
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Now the enemy has reached the gate of our home.

569
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Although I am a woman,

570
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I don't dare to be bullied.

571
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I also want to protect my home.

572
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I used to fight with the old Marquis.

573
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Now I am beaten by the enemy.

574
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I must let them know the power of Wei.

575
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yes.

576
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We are the Marquis.

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I know your heart of protection.

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Thank you all.

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And us.

580
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And us.

581
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Today's battle is difficult to win.

582
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But we are here to tell you that

583
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
the Wei family didn't betray the Wei State.

584
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And we will never betray the Wei State.

585
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

586
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
As long as we, the Wei family,

587
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
are here, the Wei State is here.

588
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The Wei family is here.

589
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The Wei State is here.

590
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Let's live together.

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We love the Wei State.

592
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,520
Could it be that this is a clue to the move?

593
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,560
đãㄱㄗaler!

594
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
You can't even see it.

595
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,580
You're Yang Jian because you've made food for me.

596
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,600
Think I'm pretending.

597
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,680
Damn!

598
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,140
帮我把张峰接回来

599
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,180
顺道带点兰草

600
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,940
回来小团两天里找钱

601
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,540
Xie Chen gold

602
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:52,600
for your clarity and

603
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,060
understanding.

604
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,980
Too bad

605
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
I'm not here.

606
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,940
I'm here to pick you up, brother.

607
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,020
I'm here to pick you home.

608
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,140
You've been a brave general for me.

609
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,420
How could you give up?

610
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,220
How could you give up?

611
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,700
You're so cruel.

612
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
I don't want to be a grass-digger, brother.

613
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,340
I don't want to be a grass-digger.

614
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Get up.

615
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,180
Come back with me.

616
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,380
Get up.

617
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,020
Get up.

618
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,540
I won't touch you.

619
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,100
I won't be a grass-digger anymore.

620
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,860
I'll wait until I get married to you.

621
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,580
Then I'll go home.

622
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,820
Go.

623
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,700
Wu'er, are you cold?

624
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,420
Brother.

625
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,500
I'm not here to stay.

626
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,260
I'll take you home.

627
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,380
Still dry.

628
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,420
Why?

629
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,260
Let me dry you.

630
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,620
Also dying.

631
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,860
Tell me if you want any planting.

632
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,500
Changing!

633
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,180
ematic.

634
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,020
!

635
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,860
riding.

636
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,020
Kill him!

637
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,020
Dago.

638
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:12,740
The

639
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,360
Palanquin

640
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,640
is gone.

641
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,380
Go to Hong Kong

642
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,000
and come back to take the messiah back.

643
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:30,340
The

644
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,540
Quick

645
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,500
be specific about his job

646
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,660
Although I can't see it

647
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,620
But there's some泣 Hyundai holy martial yourselves

648
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,660
I won't drag you back

649
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,940
You just need to

650
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,660
follow your lead

651
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,140
Zhou Jinwo

652
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,300
Who did you betray?

653
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,540
Wei Jiang and Wei Liang.

654
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,140
You two,

655
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,740
I advise you to stop the music.

656
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,380
I don't know when

657
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,860
a good man will be in charge in Yan State.

658
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,620
You should know it.

659
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,820
Your Zhou Mu

660
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,900
was killed by Lord Liangya in Pan Yi.

661
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,460
The people of Liangya are keeping the news

662
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,180
to separate Yan State from the future.

663
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,380
Brother is dead.

664
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,220
Now that Qiao Yue is dead,

665
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,220
Zhou Mu will be the new emperor.

666
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,420
You are sure to

667
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,620
fight with him now.

668
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,580
I'm sure of it.

669
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,900
Take me down now.

670
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,500
Lord Liangya is rewarded.

671
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,340
The army of Wei will be in Pan Yi.

672
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,740
Lord Liangya can't protect himself.

673
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,940
Not to mention you.

674
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,540
Brothers, think it over.

675
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,940
Are you going to listen to a Liangya

676
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,980
or your own army?

677
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,580
There is an old friend

678
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,020
who has crossed my fingers

679
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,940
and touched my heart.

680
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,660
She is like an old friend

681
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,540
but she has a crush on someone.

682
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,740
I have nothing to ask for

683
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,460
but to make a wish.

684
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,100
I don't want to go home.

685
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:44,900
Goodbye.

686
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,460
I'm afraid that I'll miss you for the rest of my life

687
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,460
I'll never forget your kindness

688
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:14,460
I'll never forget your kindness

689
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,460
I'll never forget your kindness

690
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,460
I'll never forget your kindness

691
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,460
I'll never forget your kindness

692
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,460
I'll never forget your kindness

693
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I'm willing to cross the sea of mountains to help you cross the wind and rain

694
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,460
Waiting for the white-haired man to enter the first line

695
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,460
The river is hard to speak, the rain is not wet, falling on your eyebrows

696
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,460
The heart is sad, the tears are flowing

697
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,460
I'm willing to stand by your side and watch your smile

698
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,460
Even if there's a storm behind me

699
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,460
I'll never forget your kindness

700
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:17,460
I'll never forget your kindness

701
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,460
