Yesterday,
it was you who brought me back?

56
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,740
Yes.

57
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,410
You were drunk yesterday.

58
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,490
Did I say anything
that might have upset you

59
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,410
when I was drunk?

60
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,770
No.

61
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,610
Who scratched you?

62
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,460
It wasn't me, was it?

63
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,460
You can't drink anymore.

64
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,660
I never scratched anyone
after drinking before.

65
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,410
Liang.

66
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,250
My Lord, what happened to your neck?

67
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,090
Are you alright?

68
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,130
A cat scratched it.

69
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420
Hyah!

70
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,730
When did the Lord have a cat?

71
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,220
You're so silly.

72
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,060
- What happened?
- Hyah!

73
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,020
My Lady.

74
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,810
What's wrong?

75
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,220
Well,

76
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,100
back when we were in Rongjun,

77
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,170
Wei Liang gave me
a little gold dart, right?

78
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,900
- Did you lose it?
- No.

79
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,410
How could I have lost it?

80
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,980
Well,

81
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,220
I want to give him a gift in return.

82
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,580
It's something I promised him

83
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,370
when I asked why the Lord

84
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,290
was angry last time.

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,900
Go ahead. What are you hesitating for?

86
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,660
I want to give him

87
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,100
this.

88
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,370
A heart-guarding mirror.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,540
It's good and practical.

90
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,410
But it's just a plain bronze mirror.

91
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,220
I want to give him something better,

92
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,250
but I don't know much about it.

93
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,250
My Lady, could you help me decide?

94
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,660
- Leave it to me.
- Thank you, My Lady.

95
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,930
My Lord.

96
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:50,890
Where is the Lady?

97
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,220
She went out to buy something

98
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,540
at the West Market.

99
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,220
She should be back soon.

100
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Okay. Got it.

101
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,450
Yes.

102
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,650
My Lady.

103
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,700
You're back so early today.

104
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,620
Yes.

105
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,460
What did you do today?

106
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,540
I just took a stroll on the street.

107
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,580
Have you had dinner?

108
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,420
Not yet.

109
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,170
Go prepare the food.

110
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,010
Yes.

111
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,050
I'll change my clothes.

112
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,060
Alright.

113
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,250
Are you busy today?

114
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,130
Not really.

115
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
Even if you're working for me,

116
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,710
you must take care of your health.

117
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,460
You must be talking

118
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,060
about the Deer Hunt, right?

119
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,820
Don't worry.

120
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,180
I've basically prepared the invitations.

121
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,820
You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

122
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,340
But there's one thing

123
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,980
I'd like to report to you.

124
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,610
I haven't seen my cousin in a while,

125
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,490
so I'd like to invite them

126
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,890
to represent Yanzhou

127
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,010
for this event.

128
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,100
Sure, it's nothing serious.

129
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,570
Oh, right.

130
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,890
Don't invite anyone

131
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,980
from Bianzhou.

132
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,030
After all, the canal repairs
have nothing to do with them.

133
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,060
Moreover,

134
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,220
if we invite them,

135
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,140
it'd make things hard
for Grandmother and Yan.

136
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,580
I understand.

137
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,700
Don't you

138
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,700
have something to say to me?

139
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,140
Is there

140
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,220
something you haven't done?

141
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,850
I need to write the invitations.

142
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,340
Then I'll leave you to it.

143
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,490
I'll check if the food is ready.

144
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,660
I'm starving.

145
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,130
I... Should I go?

146
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,300
No, I'll go.

147
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,090
My Lady.

148
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,340
Did you forget something?

149
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,660
Done.

150
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,370
Now, you no longer have to worry

151
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,850
about the candle going out at night.

152
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,660
Thank you.

153
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
Wait.

154
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,610
Don't you have

155
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,940
anything else to do?

156
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,970
No.

157
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,300
Then get some rest.

158
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,100
(Boya)

159
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,130
You can ignore your uncle,

160
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,460
but your father is
most worried about you.

161
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,180
Go back and let him know you're safe.

162
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,530
Well,

163
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,010
when will you return?

164
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,300
Fan and Bi Zhi

165
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,580
are going to Yujun for the Deer Hunt.

166
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,820
I'll go with them.

167
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,980
It's also a good chance to see

168
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,100
how your sister is doing.

169
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,610
Is the Deer Hunt an event

170
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,060
with the horse riding
and archery competition?

171
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,700
I've only heard of it

172
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,770
but never seen it.

173
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,180
It's not about fun.

174
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,820
We're going for serious matters.

175
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,280
It's inconvenient to bring you along.

176
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,980
Ci,

177
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,060
I've asked some escorts
to send you back.

178
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,490
You can rest assured and go.

179
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,610
Bi Zhi,

180
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,250
I still want something.

181
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,420
With it,

182
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,460
I won't have any regrets
on this trip back.

183
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,650
Go ahead.

184
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,770
I'll get it for you.

185
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
I want a horse
that can run a thousand li a day

186
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,340
that no one else can catch up with.

187
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,700
That's easy.

188
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,540
No problem.

189
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,490
Thank you.

190
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,730
The basic schedule
for the Deer Hunt has been set.

191
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
The first day,

192
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,250
combat trials.

193
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,460
The second day,

194
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,490
hunting and capture.

195
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,890
In the evening,
there will be a banquet for the guests

196
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,300
to discuss the canal repair project.

197
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,100
Although this event

199
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,700
is to show the strength of Wei,

200
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,100
we still need

201
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,220
to pay attention
to safety during the trials.

202
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,770
At this time,

203
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,980
the heart-guarding mirror
is very important.

204
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,370
At a critical moment,

205
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,520
it can really save your life.

206
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
Of course.

207
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,700
Speaking of this, I just remembered

208
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,010
that the Lady made me

209
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,320
a special heart-guarding mirror.

210
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,610
It's thicker than usual,

211
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,420
and it has scriptures carved around it

212
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,100
for protection.

213
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,300
My Lord,

214
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,650
is this the one you meant?

215
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,730
How did it end up with you?

216
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,940
Xiaotao gave it to me this morning.

217
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,490
Xiaotao must've given you the wrong one.

218
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,690
Take it.

219
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,010
I made a mistake.

220
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,370
The one I have is

221
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,420
inlaid with white jade

222
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,890
and trimmed with gold thread,

223
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,010
and there are

224
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,820
two mandarin ducks carved on it,

225
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,820
symbolizing deep affection.

226
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,700
The one from the Lady must be different.

227
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,650
It must be different.

228
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,820
Leave me.

229
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,510
(General's Mansion)
Don't play around on the way.

230
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,500
Just go home.

231
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,370
Got it.

232
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,580
Please stay.

233
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,700
You should stay, Aunt.

234
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,020
Fan.

235
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,650
Be careful on the way.

236
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,060
Bye.

237
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,940
The list has been discussed
with Mr. Gongsun.

238
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,700
Is there anyone else you want to invite?

239
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,490
No.

240
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,570
You decide.

241
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,730
By the way,

242
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,700
last time you mentioned

243
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,060
inviting your cousin

244
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,180
and Bi Zhi over.

245
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,820
Yes.

246
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,530
Are they still on good terms?

247
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,420
Yes.

248
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,890
Bi Zhi

249
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,490
is also a martial artist,

250
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,770
so he probably often competes
with others.

251
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,300
Yes.

252
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,610
With blades and swords,

253
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,700
he must often get hurt, right?

254
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,850
Of course.

255
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,250
Does your cousin ever

256
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,890
make armor for him?

257
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,420
Or

258
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,300
something else?

259
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,860
Perhaps shoes and socks.

260
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,660
That won't be enough.

261
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,870
What about other things?

262
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,460
If you think there's anything

263
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,330
my cousin does wrong,

264
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,700
just tell me.

265
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,010
It's nothing.

266
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,290
What's wrong, My Lord?

267
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,940
Today, I had a match

268
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,090
with Wei Liang.

269
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,460
Both of us ended up injured,

270
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,490
but only I'm feeling pain

271
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,620
in my chest now.

272
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,730
Were you hurt?

273
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,660
Wei Liang's a moron.

274
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,460
How could he have hurt you?

275
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,770
It's fine.

276
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,090
With his skills,
he normally couldn't hurt me.

277
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,090
But...

278
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,290
But he was wearing
a heart-guarding mirror.

279
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,530
I wasn't.

280
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,420
How about this?

281
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,360
I'll instruct them

282
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,660
to make sure the meals these days

283
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,900
don't include spicy or trigger foods.

284
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,990
Are you really okay?

285
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,140
Should I call the physician?

286
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,050
No need.

287
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,570
Let's eat.

288
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,480
You can't drink the soup.

289
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
There's fish.

290
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,260
Alright.

291
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,740
Then...

292
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,220
Eat this.

293
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,320
You've been looking
at this mirror all day.

294
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,390
What's so special about it?

295
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,590
Don't touch it.

296
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,570
Slow down.

297
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,860
Since you got this mirror,

298
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,380
you haven't been walking properly.

299
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,290
It's a token
of Xiaotao's good intentions.

300
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,140
It's useless,

301
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,460
yet you're showing it off.

302
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,380
It's meant to protect you,

303
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,290
not for you to protect it.

304
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,460
What does the Lord mean by "humph"?

305
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,770
If you don't handle this well,

306
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,460
it won't just be a "humph".

307
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,420
If you're sent to a bitter, cold place,

308
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,460
you'll really need

309
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,660
this mirror.

310
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,740
You're all jealous of me.

311
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,090
- Come.
- What's wrong?

312
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,250
Why so sneaky?

313
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,380
I have a question.

314
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,690
Did the Lady give the Lord

315
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,290
a heart-guarding mirror?

316
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,890
The one inlaid with white jade

317
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,680
with gold thread
and a mandarin duck pattern?

318
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,570
What? There's no such thing.

319
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,720
There's no such a heart-guarding mirror

320
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,940
in the world.

321
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
Soon, there will be.

322
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,090
I've been to all the shops in Yujun.

323
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,620
The heart-guarding mirrors
are either bronze or brass.

324
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,620
No one has ever heard
of a jade-inlaid one,

325
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,090
let alone sell it.

326
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,620
The Lord is really making it hard
for us.

327
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,900
Since he said it,

328
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,250
I have to make it for him.

329
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,530
We've received a lot of gifts lately.

330
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,220
I remember there's a piece
of fine white jade

331
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,900
and some gold and silver.

332
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,290
You go get them.

333
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,220
- Sure.
- Yes.

334
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,330
General.

335
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,220
General, General.

336
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,980
My Lady.

337
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,520
Young Master Ci didn't want to return,

338
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,620
so he left his silver spear

339
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,180
and headed straight toward Yujun.

340
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,420
The general selected

341
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,770
the horse he rode,

342
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,220
so we couldn't catch up.

343
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,460
What did he say?

344
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,330
He said he'd wait for the Lady in Yujun.

345
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,570
Yulu,

346
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,980
go after him now.

347
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,820
Yes.

348
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,860
♪The graceful grass♪

349
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,010
♪Stands alone yet captivating♪

350
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,980
- Leave us.
- Yes.

351
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
♪Twists into the night♪

352
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,370
Ehuang,

353
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,220
your voice is damaged.

354
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,940
If you keep singing,

355
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,700
your voice...

356
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,490
It will never recover anyway.

357
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,770
However,

358
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,940
its current condition

359
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,050
actually makes it easier for me to act.

360
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,140
What do you mean by this?

361
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,380
The Lord of Wei is a man

362
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,010
who values loyalty and righteousness.

363
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,810
If my voice was ruined because of him,

364
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,490
he'd surely have to accept me

365
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
and allow me to participate
in the Deer Hunt.

366
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,530
But your voice

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,980
was ruined

368
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,460
from drinking medicine, right?

369
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,730
- What does it...?
- Is that so?

370
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,140
The Governor of Yanzhou
was searching for belles

371
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,420
for a political marriage.

372
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,620
He knew I had beauty
and talent in music,

373
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,940
so he tried to abduct me
and give me to the Lord of Wei.

374
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,700
It was because of this

375
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,810
that I poisoned myself to ruin my voice.

376
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,490
Yes.

377
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,420
You're right.

378
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,940
Go prepare

379
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,620
for the trip to Yujun.

380
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,220
Bogong,

381
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,090
you can blame me.

382
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,380
But I have no other choice now.

383
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,900
♪The graceful grass♪

384
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,730
♪Stands alone yet captivating♪

385
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,970
♪My longing for it♪

386
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,670
♪Twists into the night♪

387
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,300
(We'd like to invite you to the event)

388
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,250
My Lord, the invitations are ready.

389
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,490
We can send it out today.

390
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,220
Good, thank you.

391
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,790
I'll send someone to pick it up shortly.

392
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,330
I've prepared a gift for you.

393
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,700
I hope you'll like it.

394
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,330
I'll go back to work now.

395
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,330
My Lord.

396
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,500
My Lord.

397
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,900
Lady Yulou is at the post house

398
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,250
and wishes to meet with you.

399
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,700
Got it.

400
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,860
Would you like me to go with you?

401
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,140
I promised you
I'd take good care of her.

402
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,910
You've worked hard preparing
the invitations.

403
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,810
I'll go on my own.

404
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,860
(We'll have the Deer Hunt in Yujun.)

405
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,460
(We'd like to invite you to the event.)

406
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,140
(Virtuous Words)

407
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,540
How is it?

408
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,530
Sorry for my incompetence.

409
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,530
Lady Yulou's voice

410
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,490
might be beyond treatment.

411
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,790
You may leave.

412
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,650
Yes.

413
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,620
What happened

414
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,530
to your voice?

415
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,620
My Lord,

416
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,760
since my cousin-in-law passed away,

417
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,490
to capture my cousin,

418
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,810
Chen Pang spread the news
about her beauty

419
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,980
and talent in music,

420
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,980
which made many
of the powerful covet her.

421
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
To avoid being coveted by villains,

422
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,540
my cousin

423
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
poisoned herself to ruin her voice.

424
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,090
Lady Yulou, why go to such extremes?

425
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,700
Though I am only a woman,

426
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,330
I still have my integrity.

427
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,620
You may not know,

428
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,770
- that villain...
- Zixin.

429
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
Shut up.

430
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,420
Ehuang, let me say it.

431
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,810
The villain who forced my cousin
to ruin her voice

432
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,570
was the Governor of Yanzhou,

433
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,890
Qiao Yue.

434
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,260
Qiao Yue?

435
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,620
Qiao Yue has been

436
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,050
searching for women everywhere.

437
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,860
Once he heard of my cousin's name,

438
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,220
he relentlessly pursued her

439
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,910
and even attempted to abduct her.

440
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,770
He is still in mourning.

441
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,140
Why would he do this?

442
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,940
You may not know,

443
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,250
but Qiao Yue's search for women

444
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,940
was not for his own sake

445
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,730
but to offer them to the states

446
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,180
in an attempt to forge alliances.

447
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,350
This time, he wanted to abduct my cousin

448
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,980
and offer her to you

449
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,250
and solidify his niece's position

450
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,180
as the Lady of Wei.

451
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,290
He surely did not know

452
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,140
that we were old acquaintances,

453
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,860
so he sent his nephew to chase me,

454
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,530
trying to forcibly bring me

455
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,980
back to Kangjun.

456
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,730
You mean Qiao Ci?

457
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,530
He's young

458
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,940
but ruthless.

459
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,700
To catch me,

460
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,810
he used any means necessary.

461
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,460
Thankfully, Zixin protected me,

462
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,490
so we narrowly escaped.

463
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,300
However,

464
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,220
along the way,

465
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,530
even the jade Bogong left me

466
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,090
was lost.

467
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,290
I didn't want to come back to Yujun,

468
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,380
but now,

469
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,010
I really have no other choice.

470
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,010
How could this happen?

471
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,140
In my desperation,

472
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,140
I had no choice but to ruin my voice.

473
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,420
That beautiful singing voice

474
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,180
was useless

475
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,770
and only brought trouble.

476
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,050
It was better to destroy it.

477
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,220
I refuse to be a caged bird,

478
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,250
serving men with my beauty.

479
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,770
Zhonglin,

480
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,090
there's something I must ask you.

481
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,090
I don't care what Qiao Yue thinks,

482
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,330
but you...

483
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,940
What do you think?

484
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,330
Did you really have Qiao Yue

485
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,810
search the world for belles
to present to you?

486
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,530
I don't know anything about that.

487
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,180
Then I'm at ease.

488
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,220
It seems like the Qiao Clan
acted on their own.

489
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Lady Qiao wouldn't have known it.

490
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,140
You must not

491
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,180
blame her for this.

492
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,570
Lady Yulou, rest assured.

493
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,380
Lady Qiao

494
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,660
couldn't have known about this,

495
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,250
and I won't blame her.

496
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,730
It's very improper

497
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,090
for the Qiao Clan to do
such a disgraceful thing

498
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,050
relying on your favor toward Lady Qiao.

499
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,860
What they destroyed today

500
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,050
was the jade pendant Bogong left me.

501
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,750
Tomorrow,

502
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,570
they might destroy
your family's reputation

503
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,010
that's been built over generations.

504
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,050
Lady Yulou, rest assured.

505
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,290
You'll surely get an explanation
for this.

506
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,570
Please take care.

507
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,570
I'm leaving now.

508
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,090
Zixin.

509
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,850
Ehuang.

510
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,250
Get a new carriage and horses.

511
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,330
Rest assured.

512
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,380
What's most valuable about you

513
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,810
is your noble bearing.

514
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,530
You must never lose that no matter when.

515
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,060
Wei Liang.

516
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,020
My Lord.

517
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,140
The Governor of Yanzhou
has been collecting belles

518
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
to send to the states.

519
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Do you know about this?

520
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,250
Previously,

521
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,490
I heard that there was
a belle in Yaozhou,

522
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,180
and they sent someone to check on her.

523
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,090
That's all.

524
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,290
My Lord,

525
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,380
why are you so angry?

526
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,500
My Lord,

527
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,460
I've brought back the invitations

528
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,860
from the Lady as you instructed.

529
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,330
Do you want to confirm it again?

530
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,850
Send them off.

531
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,890
Wait a moment.

532
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,690
The Qiao Clan
will not be invited for now.

533
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,330
Send the others off.

534
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,700
Yes.

535
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,260
(We'd like to invite you to the event.)

536
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,730
Why are you giving Lady Yulou a gift?

537
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,250
Since I've promised the Lord

538
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,460
to take good care of her,

539
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,050
I will do my utmost.

540
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,570
(Gift List)
I've looked at it.

541
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,630
(Flower table, dining table)
These items are good.

542
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,980
Add a stove.

543
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,530
She's been traveling for so long,

544
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,490
and she's fallen ill.

545
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,810
Hurry and send them over.

546
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:41,650
Yes.

547
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,940
My Lady.

548
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,090
My Lady.

549
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,420
Something's wrong.

550
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,860
You're too old to be so flustered.

551
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,330
Can't you speak calmly?

552
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,380
Duang said

553
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,220
that the Lord withheld
the invitation to Boya,

554
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,950
because Lady Yulou complained to him,

555
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,090
saying the governor wanted
to strengthen your position

556
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,860
and sent Young Master Ci to abduct her

557
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,140
to offer her to the Lord.

558
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,420
How could Uncle be so foolish?

559
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,490
The governor could do such a thing,

560
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,810
but why would Young Master Ci
be involved?

561
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,570
I don't know.

562
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,980
Duang said

563
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,120
that the Lord has confirmed.

564
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,560
Everyone knows that the governor
has been searching

565
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,490
for belles everywhere.

566
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,040
He even claimed that Yanzhou and Wei
are doing this together.

567
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,810
Now, the Lord is angry.

568
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,010
My Lady,

569
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,220
should you ask for mercy
on behalf of Yanzhou?

570
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,370
The Deer Hunt is such a big event.

571
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,070
If there's no representative
from Yanzhou,

572
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,810
it will be humiliating.

573
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Don't panic for now.

574
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,330
This is half true and half false,

575
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,050
and we can't explain it all at once.

576
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
Besides, he's angry right now,

577
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,140
so we can't ask him head-on.

578
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,290
What is this?

579
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,280
This is the jade pendant
that my brother gave to Lady Yulou,

580
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,460
but it was broken

581
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,090
when she escaped to Yujun.

582
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,290
I'm really sorry

583
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,220
for what my uncle did.

584
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,980
You don't need to doubt me.

585
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,090
I feel the same as you

586
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,900
on this.

587
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,490
You're not even pleading
for your family?

588
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,140
My uncle has always been foolish.

589
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,770
I'll write a letter home

590
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,620
and ask him what he's thinking.

591
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,010
Then I'll explain to you.

592
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,420
I have a question.

593
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,810
If one day,

594
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,860
the two families have a dispute,

595
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,460
will you stand by my side?

596
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,730
Right now,

597
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,330
I am standing by your side, right?

598
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,980
Though this was not caused by me,

599
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,140
I'm still related to it.

600
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,460
Tomorrow,
I'll ask Lady Yulou for forgiveness,

601
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,620
and I'll help her fix this jade pendant.

602
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,010
There's no need.

603
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,570
I don't blame you.

604
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,330
I'm just a little disappointed.

605
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,820
Your uncle

606
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
is doing evil outside under the banner

607
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,130
of the Qiao-Wei alliance.

608
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,380
I must give the world an explanation.

609
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,210
And

610
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,010
we can't go as you wish

611
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,330
and invite your cousin
to the Deer Hunt now.

612
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,530
You're put in a tough spot.

613
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,460
I can understand.

614
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,980
Can't you just be

615
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,940
my wife?

616
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,860
(Chijun, Liangya)

617
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,340
(Mansion of the Lord of Liangya,
Liangya)

618
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,260
I've already told you.

619
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,170
The Lady

620
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,610
is being favored now,

621
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,900
so we can't confront her head-on.

622
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,300
You always say
we should keep a low profile,

623
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,730
but I'm afraid
that might cause future trouble.

624
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,340
She whispers in Father's ear every day,

625
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,740
wanting her son Liu Qi
to become the heir.

626
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,170
Do you think
practicing martial arts here

627
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,860
will solve everything?

628
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,260
You need to spend more time
pleasing the Lord.

629
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,010
As long as you win his favor,

630
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,820
she can provoke all she wants,

631
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,130
but it won't matter.

632
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,820
Remember:

633
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,260
At the end of the day,

634
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,820
you are the rightful heir.

635
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,210
Got it?

636
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,980
I heard

637
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,650
that Wei is about to hold the Deer Hunt.

638
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,940
The invitation

639
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,980
has been delivered to the Lord.

640
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,570
I believe that if you seize this chance

641
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,170
and make a name for yourself,

642
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,980
your position as the heir

643
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,380
will be secure.

644
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,610
If I go to Wei,

645
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,530
I'm afraid she'll have her way
by father's side.

646
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,860
You have

647
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,530
always been

648
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,010
so indecisive.

649
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,090
I must remind you.

650
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,860
Your position right now

651
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
is precarious.

652
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,490
Young Master,

653
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,130
the Lord has sent someone

654
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:57,970
to call for you.

655
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,580
Father.

656
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,620
My Lady.

657
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,650
The reason I called you here today

658
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,170
is regarding the Deer Hunt.

659
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,380
I've decided to take Qi to Yujun.

660
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,650
Qi is not yet eight years old.

661
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,860
I'm afraid

662
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,820
people will laugh at us

663
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,330
for having a child represent us.

664
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,130
Father, please reconsider.

665
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,300
The invitation says

666
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,260
they invite the Lord of Liangya
to attend.

667
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,420
With the Lord there,

668
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,650
who'd bully Qi for being young?

669
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,170
If there's anything to laugh about,

670
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,860
you lost your engagement

671
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,050
and Panyi to the Lord of Wei

672
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,090
and even offended him.

673
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,980
If it weren't
for your repeated mistakes,

674
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,090
why would your father
have to travel at his age

675
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,480
to reconcile with the Lord of Wei?

676
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,420
Why do you insist on going to Yujun

677
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,380
and bring disgrace upon yourself?

678
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,380
I was discussing state affairs
with Father.

679
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,460
How could you, a woman, interrupt?

680
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,860
My Lord...

681
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,760
How impudent!

682
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,530
How dare you defy your mother?

683
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,820
My mother passed away long ago.

684
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,210
My Lord,

685
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,820
Maoqing has never accepted me
as his stepmother

686
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,530
and has insulted me repeatedly.

687
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,610
You wicked woman, shut up.

688
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,010
If you defy us again,

689
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,400
I'll deprive you of your position.

690
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,490
Leave at once!

691
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,980
Father,

692
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,610
you forced me into this.

693
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,690
Guards!

694
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,690
Guards!

695
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,340
Please spare me!

696
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,090
Why?

697
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,050
Why must you commit parricide?

698
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,090
You always think I'm indecisive, right?

699
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,850
What's wrong?

700
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,690
Now, I've become the Lord of Liangya.

701
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,900
Aren't you happy about it?

702
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,260
You are the legitimate heir.

703
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,050
Why do you have to bear
the reputation of being unfilial?

704
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,690
Why didn't you consult with me first?

705
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,130
Since you like consultation so much,

706
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,050
when you and I have disagreements
in the future,

707
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,530
you can ask my late father.

708
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,860
My uncle is dead now.

709
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,860
The Liu Shan now

710
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,530
is the servant of the Lord of Liangya.

711
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,220
