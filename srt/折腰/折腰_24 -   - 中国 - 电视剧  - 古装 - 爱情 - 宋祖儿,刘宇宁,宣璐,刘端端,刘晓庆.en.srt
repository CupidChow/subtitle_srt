My uncle is dead now.

The Liu Shan now

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,740
is the servant of the Lord of Liangya.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,740
Got it?

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,700
I understand.

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,580
I understand.

36
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,260
My Lord,

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,140
I understand.

38
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,660
Chunniang,

39
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,300
help me grind the ink.

40
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,600
Yes, My Lady.

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,770
I must write to Cousin.

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
She needs to be informed of this.

43
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
My Lady.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,140
My Lady,

45
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,140
Young Master Ci left home without a word.

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,860
He's arriving at the outskirts of Yujun,

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,940
waiting to be fetched.

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,500
Ci is here?

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,300
He came without his token.

50
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,100
He must have left secretly.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,420
He sent word

52
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,300
for you to fetch him outside the city.

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,660
Prepare the carriage

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,500
and send for His Lordship to return home.

55
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,340
Yes.

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,020
Wait.

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,180
Forget it.

58
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
His Lordship is still angry.

59
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,820
If he sees Ci,

60
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,060
he'll only get angrier.

61
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,580
My Lady,

62
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,780
what if His Lordship meets Young Master Ci,

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,300
sees his true character,

64
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,860
and finally lets go of his grudges?

65
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,420
I hope so.

66
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,260
It's Uncle's mistake.

67
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,820
Ci and Bi Zhi shouldn't bear the blame.

68
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,140
Never mind.

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,940
Let's get changed

70
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,820
and prepare the carriage.

71
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,660
Yes.

72
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,340
Are you heading out of the city?

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,100
Only one carriage?

74
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,060
No escort?

75
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,100
Ci, my cousin, has suddenly arrived in Yujun,

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,060
just a dozen li from here.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,220
I wish to meet him myself

78
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,180
and would rather not trouble others.

79
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm free today. I meant to drink

80
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,780
with Zhonglin, but he's not around.

81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,700
If you don't mind,

82
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,660
I'll accompany you

83
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,740
to meet Young Master Ci.

84
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
If it's not too much trouble, I'd be honored

85
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,700
to have you with me.

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,620
(Wei Mansion)

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,460
These are tonics

88
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,300
prepared according to

89
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,260
the physician's orders.

90
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,380
The jade pendant is being repaired.

91
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,900
Lady Yulou, no need to worry.

92
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,020
Just focus on your recovery.

93
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,460
Thank you, Lord of Wei.

94
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,980
Once I'm better,

95
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,540
I'll shall pay a visit
to great-aunt and Lady Qiao.

96
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,060
But

97
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
I do have a favor to ask.

98
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,500
You don't have to be so formal with me.

99
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,340
It hasn't been easy

100
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,620
for you lately, Lady Yulou.

101
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,100
Though

102
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,500
I played no direct part,

103
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,980
I still bear some responsibility.

104
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,940
For that,

105
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,220
I owe you an apology.

106
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,940
There's no need for apologies between us.

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,260
It's just...

108
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,900
Lady Qiao knows nothing of it.

109
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,340
So, please,

110
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
do not speak of it

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,140
to Grandmother or Mother.

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm truly grateful.

113
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,420
I can let this go,

114
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,580
but I won't accept

115
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,100
being treated with contempt.

116
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,420
May I ask what do you mean?

117
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,940
The outsiders know I'm in mourning

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,340
and see me as weak and easy to slight.

119
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,620
That is why this happened.

120
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,900
But I have heard

121
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,740
the Wei State will soon host the Deer Hunt,

122
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,980
inviting all the powers.

123
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,540
If Zixin could take part, and compete

124
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,340
for the honor of the Su Clan,

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,500
then people would know

126
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,780
we are not to be underestimated,

127
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,260
and stand close to the Lord of Wei.

128
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Then perhaps,

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,620
my days ahead

130
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,500
will not be so difficult.

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,300
Please don't worry, Ehuang.

132
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,980
I'll give my all in our name

133
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,980
and bring honor at the Deer Hunt.

134
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,940
No one will dare look down on you.

135
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,140
They'll show you respect.

136
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,940
If that is so,

137
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,220
then let Su Zixin

138
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,660
represent the Su Clan of Wushan State

139
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,900
and join the Deer Hunt.

140
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Great.

141
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,300
Thank you, Lord of Wei.

142
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,500
Thank you, Lord of Wei.

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,460
My Lord!

144
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,500
What is that?

145
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,980
The item you asked me to repair.

146
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,740
The shopkeeper said

147
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,340
the broken jade could not be restored.

148
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,020
But Her Ladyship suggested

149
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,220
inlaying it with gold.

150
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,100
Now, at last,

151
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,500
it has been mended.

152
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,820
Is Her Ladyship at home?

153
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,340
Her Ladyship received news

154
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,860
that Young Master Ci
is arriving outside the city.

155
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,180
She has gone to meet him.

156
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,900
Qiao Ci is here? Why did no one tell me?

157
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,060
She didn't want to trouble you,

158
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,860
so she didn't send word.

159
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,780
Lady Qiao,

160
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,500
no need to worry.

161
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,180
Have some fruit.

162
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,540
Once you're finished,

163
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,300
your cousin will be here.

164
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,260
My Lady.

165
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,780
Manman!

166
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,660
Ci.

167
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,460
Look at you, all messy.

168
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
It's been so long since we last met.

169
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,660
You've grown taller.

170
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,460
The journey must have worn you out.

171
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,620
Not at all.

172
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,380
I just lost my favorite spear...

173
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,060
by accident.

174
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,060
It's alright.

175
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
Manman,

176
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,780
what's wrong?

177
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,860
Your cousin

178
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,660
is so proud of you, seeing you

179
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,740
grow brave and spirited

180
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,780
at such a young age. She's so happy.

181
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,700
I'm fine.

182
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,140
Greetings, My Lord.

183
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,180
This is Mr. Wei, His Lordship's cousin.

184
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,340
He came to meet you for His Lordship.

185
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,220
Just call him Mr. Wei.

186
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,220
Mr. Wei.

187
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,740
Nice to meet you, Ci.

188
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,980
Grandmother and Mother
don't know you're here yet.

189
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,140
Let's go back.

190
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,300
Alright.

191
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,460
You're getting way too bold,

192
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,820
running off to Yujun without a word.

193
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,180
Is this how the Young Master of Yanzhou acts?

194
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,220
I came alone to prove that

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,740
I can manage on my own.

196
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,180
Once we're back,

197
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,020
you must write to Uncle, Aunt,
and Father at once.

198
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,980
How could they allow you to come here alone?

199
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,260
They didn't.

200
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,140
I slipped away on my own.

201
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
What happened?

202
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,300
It's all because of Zhang Pu.

203
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,300
He urged Uncle to

204
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,420
seek out beauties everywhere,

205
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,340
offering them as gifts.

206
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,980
While Uncle gave no thoughts

207
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,020
of drilling troops or cultivating the land

208
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,460
to strengthen Yanzhou.

209
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,660
He believed such slanderous words

210
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,500
and began to stray from the right path.

211
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,340
Grandfather's name is now ruined by them.

212
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,300
Have you ever pursued Lady Yulou?

213
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,900
Lady who?

214
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,180
Forget it.

215
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,260
Let's not speak of this for now,

216
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,020
especially not in front of His Lordship.

217
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,780
Once you enter the mansion,

218
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,620
you must mind your words and conduct.

219
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
His Lordship is steady and reserved,

220
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,900
always serious.

221
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,860
He's nothing like Mr. Wei.

222
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,260
You must behave with proper decorum.

223
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,740
There's no need to grow close to him,

224
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,140
lest he form a poor opinion of you.

225
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,300
I understand.

226
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,780
(Chijun, Liangya State)

227
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,700
Greetings, My Lord.

228
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,660
You may all rise.

229
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,980
Thank you, My Lord.

230
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,380
Mother!

231
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,140
- Young Master...
- Mother!

232
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,140
- Mother!
- Young Master.

233
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,820
Mother!

234
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,940
Mother!

235
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,860
Brother,

236
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,900
where is my mother?

237
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,140
You want to see your mother, don't you?

238
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,420
I will take you

239
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,940
to see her soon.

240
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,900
Would you like that?

241
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,220
Yes.

242
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,740
- You may leave.
- Yes.

243
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,650
Young Master.

244
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,460
My late father doted on
the Young Master above all others.

245
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,620
Issue my command.

246
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,460
Have Liu Qi

247
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,060
and the Young Master

248
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,500
accompany Father

249
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,500
in burial!

250
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,060
My Lord,

251
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,300
the child is innocent.

252
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,220
I can't bear to lose my kin either.

253
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,940
But Mother poisoned Father.

254
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,220
This is the only way
to fulfill my filial duty.

255
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,980
General Lin, if you were in my place,

256
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,180
having lost all your loved ones overnight,

257
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,980
you would truly understand my pain.

258
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,980
It seems General Lin understands now.

259
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,140
In that case,

260
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,060
General Lin, please help me

261
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
see them off.

262
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,340
Yes,

263
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,180
My Lord.

264
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,780
My Lord,

265
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,300
as for the Deer Hunt in Wei State...

266
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,260
Since they have invited
the Lord of Liangya to attend in person,

267
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,300
let it be as they wish.

268
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,220
Raise high

269
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,540
the prestige of Liangya State!

270
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,060
Raise high the prestige of Liangya State!

271
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,220
I've brought you to meet
Grandmother and Mother.

272
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,020
After you see His Lordship,

273
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,980
you'll be taken to the post house to rest.

274
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
This short sword is a gift from Grandmother.

275
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,380
Treasure it well.

276
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,220
Do you understand?

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
I like it.

278
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Also,

279
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,700
don't mistake His Lordship

280
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
for someone else again.

281
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,820
Someone else?

282
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,460
My Lord,

283
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,260
this is Qiao Ci, my cousin.

284
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,540
My Lord.

285
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,260
The short sword you hold was seized

286
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,100
by Grandfather from an enemy general

287
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,100
in battle long ago.

288
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,140
You're not yet 20 years old,

289
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,940
and my grandmother gave it to you as a gift.

290
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,500
What a true honor.

291
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,660
My Lord,

292
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,380
I didn't know it belonged to Grandfather.

293
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,620
Ci is still young.

294
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,060
He doesn't understand its value.

295
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,540
I'll return it tomorrow.

296
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,340
No need.

297
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,620
Let him keep it.

298
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,220
Even the most precious things

299
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,620
become worthless

300
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,700
if left untouched.

301
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,180
Sit.

302
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,540
Thank you, My Lord.

303
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,820
Thank you for the gift.

304
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,580
Do you practice martial arts often?

305
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,500
Since I was eight, I've practising

306
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,460
at least six hours a day.

307
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,740
I've never dared to slack off.

308
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,260
I began at four, learning under Grandfather.

309
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,740
I've practised for over ten years

310
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,980
before seeing real progress.

311
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,140
Six hours a day just isn't enough.

312
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes, My Lord.

313
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,220
Do you read as well?

314
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,980
Father taught us to be well-read
and study all schools,

315
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,140
Confucianism, Mohism, Names,
Legalism, Taoism,

316
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,700
even Yin-Yang School. I've read them all.

317
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,100
That's not enough

318
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,500
to be well-read.

319
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,660
Agriculture, miscellanies,

320
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,260
novels, the works of strategists,

321
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,060
you should dabble in them all.

322
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
Yes.

323
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,780
Ci,

324
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,660
serve tea to His Lordship.

325
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,660
You've spoken at length, My Lord.

326
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,980
You must be thirsty.

327
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,740
Ci brought the tea leaves from Yanzhou.

328
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,860
My Lord,

329
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,900
please enjoy.

330
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,700
My Lord,

331
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,780
you must be weary from official duties.

332
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,580
You can't even lift your arms.

333
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,060
My Lord,

334
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,780
please enjoy.

335
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,220
You still need more practice.

336
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,340
You can't even hold a teacup steady.

337
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,980
Yes, My Lord.

338
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,820
My Lord,

339
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,900
it's getting late.

340
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,900
I'll take Ci to the post house
so he may rest.

341
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,900
Go on, then.

342
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,140
Thank you, Lord of Wei.

343
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,260
This jade pendant has been with me for years.

344
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,940
Now that it's returned to me,

345
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,940
I can finally sleep in peace tonight.

346
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,900
You've been suffered so much.

347
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,620
I promise you'll have justice.

348
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,700
Qiao Ci

349
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,220
happened to be here in Yujun.

350
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Qiao Ci is here?

351
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
How dare he show his face.

352
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
He must not know I'm here.

353
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,700
Never mind.

354
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,180
Even if we were to meet face to face,

355
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,860
he won't admit anything.

356
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,420
He might even claim

357
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,060
he never saw me at all.

358
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,420
Don't worry, Lady Yulou.

359
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,380
If Qiao Ci truly wronged you,

360
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,700
I'll make sure you get justice.

361
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,460
Zhonglin,

362
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,500
I know you mean well.

363
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,540
But this matter

364
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,380
may cause strife between you and Lady Qiao.

365
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,380
I don't want to cause more trouble.

366
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,180
So,

367
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,180
let's leave it at that.

368
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,260
My Lord,

369
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,300
Her Ladyship is here.

370
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,700
Please let Her Ladyship in.

371
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,820
Yes.

372
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,540
Zhonglin,

373
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
though Lady Qiao comes from Yanzhou,

374
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,700
whether it was Qiao Yue

375
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,980
or Qiao Ci behind this,

376
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,860
she truly had no knowledge of it.

377
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,620
Don't take it out on her.

378
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,940
We arrived in haste,

379
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,180
and I haven't seen you yet.

380
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,620
I hope you won't take offense.

381
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,020
Lady Yulou, there's no need to be so formal.

382
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,780
To be honest,

383
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,460
Ci has also come to Yujun.

384
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,540
That's how I learned of
what happened in Yanzhou.

385
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,060
Both Ci and Uncle

386
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,020
have wronged you.

387
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,980
I feel uneasy about it too.

388
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,140
But I've scolded Ci, and he admits

389
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
his mistakes.

390
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
Does he really

391
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,180
admit his mistakes?

392
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,340
Ci wants to apologize in person.

393
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,980
Would you give him that chance?

394
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,980
If old grievances can be put aside,

395
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,260
that would be best.

396
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,220
What do you say, My Lord?

397
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,420
If he's truly remorseful,

398
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,300
that's indeed best.

399
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,580
My Lord, he's here.

400
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,500
Hurry and apologize.

401
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,820
La... Lady Yulou,

402
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,300
I was wrong.

403
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,900
I know

404
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,980
you were just following your uncle's orders.

405
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,620
It's not your fault.

406
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,940
Lady Yulou,

407
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,020
this is not Young Master Ci.

408
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,420
That day, while helping you

409
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,620
with your luggage,

410
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,780
this boy secretly took some jewelry.

411
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,860
We've brought him here today

412
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,220
to apologize.

413
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,500
I see.

414
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,620
That night, when we fled Kangjun,

415
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,380
it was late at night.

416
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,660
In the chaos,

417
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,100
I couldn't see clearly.

418
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,060
I only thought their builds looked alike.

419
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,100
Lady Yulou, are you saying

420
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,980
Ci's build

421
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,460
is similar to this boy's?

422
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,140
That day, he was wearing armor.

423
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,740
I couldn't see clearly.

424
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,980
Then how did you know

425
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,540
it was Ci who took you?

426
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
Because he said so himself.

427
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,780
Is his voice deep or soft?

428
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,740
Lady Qiao, did you come here

429
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,620
to apologize or interrogate?

430
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,380
I know you're close to
your family and unwilling

431
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,300
to admit it.

432
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,420
But everyone knows what Qiao Yue has done.

433
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,940
Why deny it?

434
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,140
Would I make myself lose my voice

435
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,460
just to frame someone?

436
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,700
It's not that I don't believe you.

437
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,260
If Ci really did it,

438
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,580
I'd personally bring him

439
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,540
to apologize to you.

440
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,140
But if he didn't,

441
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,780
I won't let him be falsely accused.

442
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,060
Forget it.

443
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,540
You keep pressing me with questions.

444
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,060
No matter what I say, you won't believe me.

445
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,300
You are the Lady of Wei,

446
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,820
and now I must

447
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,140
seek help from the Lord of Wei.

448
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,460
I have nothing more to say.

449
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,980
Lady Yulou, please calm down.

450
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
I think

451
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,380
Her Ladyship makes a valid point.

452
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,700
Let's call Qiao Ci here.

453
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,020
We'll ask and find out.

454
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
Wei Liang.

455
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,660
Lord of Wei.

456
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,500
Manman.

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,380
Lady Yulou.

458
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Lady Yulou,

459
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,780
this is the real Qiao Ci.

460
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,060
On the day we fled,

461
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,260
everything was in chaos.

462
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,340
I only remember

463
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,020
words like "Governor"

464
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,380
and "nephew", something like that.

465
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,020
Perhaps it was a misunderstanding.

466
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,020
Even if I didn't do it,

467
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,220
you were truly frightened.

468
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,860
Lady Yulou, I hope you rest well

469
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,180
and recover soon.

470
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,220
Ci has been traveling for days.

471
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,860
I'll take him back to rest.

472
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll come to visit you

473
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,980
another day, Lady Yulou.

474
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,860
Lady Yulou,

475
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,760
so,

476
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,980
the misunderstanding's resolved.

477
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,700
Thank you for clearing it up, Lord of Wei.

478
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,580
I just hope

479
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,220
this won't cause strife
between you and Lady Qiao.

480
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,740
Her Ladyship is generous.

481
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,700
She won't blame me.

482
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,940
I'll take my leave now.

483
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,460
Take care and get some rest.

484
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,620
Ehuang,

485
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,900
how dare the Qiaos

486
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,180
toy with us!

487
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,740
Anger won't solve anything.

488
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,140
At the Deer Hunt,

489
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,500
you must defeat Qiao Ci

490
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,340
and reclaim our honor.

491
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,460
(Yujun Post House)

492
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Have you gotten over it, My Lord?

493
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,820
Where is Qiao Ci?

494
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,780
I sent him back.

495
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,700
In a few days, take him to the drill ground

496
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,060
and see what he's capable of.

497
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,820
Aren't you mad at me

498
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,860
for being biased

499
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,460
and listening to only one side?

500
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,260
You had deep doubts about my family.

501
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,820
No wonder you reacted that way.

502
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,740
You never held my family against me,

503
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,380
so why would I be mad at you?

504
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,580
(Luozhong Tavern)

505
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,420
Here, have a bite.

506
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
Mr. Wei.

507
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,380
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Wei.

508
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,220
- It's been so long.
- You finally came.

509
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,300
Who's this young man?

510
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,660
Who's this handsome boy?

511
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,340
- So fair and pretty.
- Let me ease your shoulders.

512
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,460
He's still too young.

513
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,780
We're just here for a drink.

514
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,100
You all may leave us now.

515
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,060
Let's go, let's go.

516
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,340
Cheers.

517
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,780
Mr. Wei.

518
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,380
I still feel

519
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,220
a bit awkward.

520
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,860
If Manman finds out,

521
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,780
she won't let me off.

522
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,660
I'd better go back.

523
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,220
See you, Mr. Wei.

524
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
- Oh, cutie.
- Don't go!

525
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,900
Come again soon!

526
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,380
Why are you up out here so late?

527
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,020
Manman punished me to stand here

528
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,580
for four hours.

529
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,100
There's no one around.

530
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,380
Why stand so straight?

531
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
Punishment is still punishment.

532
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,500
I can't slack off.

533
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,180
You're serious about it, huh?

534
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,940
What were you thinking,

535
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,420
provoking her?

536
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,020
Even I wouldn't dare.

537
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,700
So, what did you do wrong?

538
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,100
Mr. Wei took me to Luozhong Tavern.

539
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,900
Manman found out.

540
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,180
Not even Mr. Wei could save me.

541
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,780
He almost got scolded too.

542
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,260
Alright, put that down.

543
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,860
You know what?

544
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Come inside with me.

545
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,980
I'll speak for you.

546
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,100
She'll spare you

547
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,220
for my sake.

548
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,020
My Lord, you're not

549
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
lying to me, right?

550
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm a noble lord. How could I lie to you?

551
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,660
Let's go.

552
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,500
My Lord.

553
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,630
Please leave us.

554
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,500
Yes.

555
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,340
Come in.

556
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,460
Ci

557
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,420
just went to the Luozhong Tavern

558
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,660
and had a few drinks.

559
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,220
It's no big deal.

560
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,180
So don't be mad at him.

561
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,980
He's just arrived in Yujun,

562
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,300
having some fun at Luozhong Tavern

563
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
is fine, you know.

564
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,780
Is it?

565
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,220
So, you're a regular at Luozhong Tavern too?

566
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,620
You're defending him
because you share the same hobby?

567
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,340
How could I possibly go to a place like that?

568
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,660
I never do.

569
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,540
Well, maybe twice. With Yan.

570
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,700
Actually, just once.

571
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
So, was it once

572
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,940
or twice?

573
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,700
Kneel down!

574
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,620
You're still a kid, and you dare

575
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,620
step foot in such a sleazy place?

576
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,580
What kind of man will you

577
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,900
grow into at this rate?

578
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,580
Apologize to your cousin!

579
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,980
Now!

580
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,180
Manman!

581
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,820
My dear cousin.

582
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,900
I'm sorry, Manman.

583
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,500
Manman...

584
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,460
Enough, I'm holding a needle here.

585
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:23,890
Yes.

586
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,420
Ci understands his fault now.

587
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,260
It won't happen again.

588
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,150
Don't be angry.

589
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
Yes, Manman.

590
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,620
I won't go there ever again,

591
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,940
even if His Lordship asks me.

592
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,180
I definitely won't go there.

593
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,580
Not a chance. Never.

594
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,980
Alright, don't be mad.

595
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,140
Let me tell you something

596
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
that will cheer you up.

597
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,260
Take a look at this.

598
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,900
Have a look.

599
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,140
Get up.

600
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,420
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou)
It's too late

601
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,180
to send an invitation to Bi Zhi now.

602
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,620
So, I've decided

603
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,820
to have Ci represent Yanzhou

604
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,060
at the Deer Hunt.

605
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,820
Really, My Lord?

606
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,100
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou)

607
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,940
Ci, thank His Lordship.

608
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,940
Thank you, My Lord.

609
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,420
Alright.

610
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,900
From today,

611
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,820
I'll oversee your martial training every day,

612
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,300
and your cousin can keep you in check too.

613
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,740
Starting tomorrow,

614
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,420
you'll move into the mansion.

615
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,260
Thank you, My Lord.

616
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,060
Work hard, will you?

617
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,260
(Boya)

618
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,260
Fan,

619
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,260
what's wrong?

620
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,820
The Deer Hunt is just

621
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,980
a few days away,

622
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,220
but we still haven't received
an invitation from Wei.

623
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,510
Be patient.

624
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Maybe it's

625
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,860
just delayed on the road.

626
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,820
Reporting!

627
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,420
General, a letter from Wei State
just arrived.

628
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,860
Heavy rains made the roads muddy,

629
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,540
causing a two-day delay.

630
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,500
You may go.

631
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,340
See?

632
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,180
I told you,

633
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,940
it must've been delayed on the road.

634
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,900
(With the Deer Hunt coming up
and so much going on, I have to give it up.)

635
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,060
In a few days,

636
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,740
arrange for someone
to escort Mother back to Kangjun.

637
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,420
Back to Kangjun?

638
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,820
Aren't we going to Yujun?

639
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,700
Manman is doing well in Yujun.

640
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,260
There's no need for us to visit her.

641
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,620
Tired?

642
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,180
Manman.

643
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,500
Why is this so heavy?

644
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,660
I filled it with clay and stones.

645
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
It's solid.

646
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,700
That's quite impressive.

647
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,500
A few days ago,
I only thought you'd grown taller,

648
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,420
but your mindset has matured too.

649
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,980
Father never eased up

650
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,180
on my training.

651
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,580
I'm sorry for having you train here

652
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,740
in this courtyard.

653
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,980
Not at all.

654
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,940
After all, this isn't our own home.

655
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,700
Manman,

656
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,980
I came to visit you

657
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,460
because I was worried about you.

658
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,020
Now it seems you're the one

659
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,260
worrying about me.

660
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,900
Now that you've seen me,

661
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,020
do you feel reassured?

662
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,780
After seeing His Lordship,

663
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,260
I'm not quite reassured.

664
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,460
His Lordship is

665
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,020
a strange one, that's true.

666
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,420
But he's not a bad person.

667
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,700
He treats me very well.

668
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,260
You're always praising him,

669
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,140
but I don't see it.

670
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,700
You know the feud between
the Qiaos and Weis, don't you?

671
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,620
He took on the role of patriarch
at a young age.

672
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,180
It hasn't been easy for him.

673
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,460
He keeps everything bottled up.

674
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,340
But deep down,

675
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,660
he's caring and gentle.

676
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,540
Once he trusts someone,

677
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,940
he looks after them

678
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,140
with all his heart and faith.

679
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,900
So, His Lordship

680
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,380
doesn't see me as family.

681
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,260
He does care about you.

682
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,420
He just doesn't know how to show it.

683
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,980
(Yujun)

684
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,860
Bets are final!

685
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Yaozhou will surely win.

686
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,420
(Slay All Foes)
Sharp eye! Well spotted.

687
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,140
Please pay over there.

688
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,180
It's about to start.

689
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,860
Why hasn't the Lord of Liangya arrived yet?

690
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,900
Liangya State is always punctual.

691
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,380
Did the Lord of Wei not invite him?

692
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,060
Greetings, My Lady.

693
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,940
No.

694
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,340
I heard the Lord of Liangya

695
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,980
is bringing his youngest son to Yujun.

696
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,420
I suppose Young Master Liu

697
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,620
is making a scene over there.

698
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,420
- Greetings, My Lady.
- Greetings, My Lady.

699
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,660
- Greetings, My Lady.
- My Lady.

700
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,380
Please accept my respects, sirs.

701
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,260
You've come all this way to Yujun

702
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,300
out of respect for Grandfather.

703
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,940
We've known Lord Qiao

704
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,260
for over ten years.

705
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,620
You used to pull my beard

706
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,060
when you were a child, My Lady.

707
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,820
No need for formalities with us.

708
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,700
Feel free to talk to us.

709
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,020
It's a pity

710
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,500
Lord Qiao passed so suddenly.

711
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,460
I missed seeing him before he passed.

712
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,060
Why bring this up now?

713
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,580
You'll only make Her Ladyship sad.

714
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,140
(Government Office)

715
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,020
It's Young Master Liu.

716
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,900
The Lord of Liangya only sent you here?

717
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,820
Are they trying to slight Wei State?

718
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,260
- Exactly.
- That's right.

719
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,000
The Lord of Liangya

720
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,860
has come to attend the Deer Hunt.

721
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,300
The Late Lord of Liangya has passed away.

722
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,980
The Late Lady of Liangya

723
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,740
and all his other children

724
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,500
followed him in death

725
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,340
due to their deep sorrow,

726
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,860
because they were so closely bonded.

727
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,900
- What?
- So sudden.

728
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,380
How could it happen?

729
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,860
Exactly.

730
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,740
Xiaoqiao,

731
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,060
it's been a long time.

732
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,460
Lord of Liangya, I hope you've been well.

733
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,020
(Peace and Prosperity)

734
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,540
(Peace and Prosperity)

735
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,780
Lady Yulou has arrived.

736
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,020
Lady Yulou?

737
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,060
She's the widow of Chen Xiang from Bianzhou.

738
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,780
Chen Pang now leads Bianzhou.

739
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,300
Why is she here?

740
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,380
Yeah, that's odd.

741
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,180
I'm Lady Su from Wushan State,

742
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,780
here by Lord of Wei's grace

743
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
to attend the Deer Hunt.

744
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,380
Lady Yulou, please take a seat.

745
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,740
My Lord,

746
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,460
Lady Yulou has a peony mark

747
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,980
on her forehead.

748
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,460
People say,

749
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,740
whoever wins her,

750
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,260
wins the realm.

751
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,580
If it's that magical,

752
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,940
why is she widowed?

753
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Everyone here today

754
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,860
is a leading figure from their region.

755
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,420
Lady Su lost her husband,

756
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,300
and still got Wushan State
an official invitation.

757
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,900
She's now equal to nobles like us.

758
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,420
I'm afraid

759
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,180
her strength goes far beyond a peony.

760
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,140
You're right, My Lord.

761
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,900
Ci,

762
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,980
all here today are martial experts.

763
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,660
Just do what you can.

764
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,660
Don't worry, My Lord.

765
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,980
Since it's a match,

766
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,140
I will give it my all.

767
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,380
I won't look down on anyone.

768
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,060
The auspicious moment is upon us!

769
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,300
The Deer Hunt

770
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,020
officially begins!

771
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,980
Round one,

772
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,380
Arena Duel.

773
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,300
The winner will earn

774
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,380
the title of Champion of the Arena

775
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,620
and be awarded a treasure steed.

776
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,500
Please welcome

777
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,860
the warrior from Yenzhou

778
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,540
and the warrior from Yaozhou.

779
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,100
(Zhao Hong'en, Yenzhou;
Qin Qingshan, Yaozhou)

780
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,020
(Taozhou warrior)
The duel between Yenzhou and Yaozhou

781
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,900
(Slay All Foes)
has already begun!

782
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,340
Who will be the winner?

783
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,190
Place your bets.

784
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,220
Come on!

785
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,090
Place your bets.

786
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,380
Come on! Place your bets.

787
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,540
- Bet more, win more!
- What's going on over there?

788
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,260
Don't hesitate, everyone.

789
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,420
Place your bets now.

790
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,660
(Slay All Foes)
The result is coming!

791
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,100
People have set up a gambling table

792
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,740
to bet on the match outcomes.

793
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,700
But no one knows

794
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,980
how strong these warriors are.

795
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,100
What are they betting on?

796
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,260
Just wild guesses?

797
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,140
Yeah, only fools would bet.

798
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,940
Win money? Only fools wouldn't bet!

799
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,890
Hurry up, hurry up!

800
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,420
The duel result between

801
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,220
Yenzhou and Yaozhou is coming soon.

802
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,680
(Yanzhou warrior)
Place your bets!

803
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,460
Why is no one betting on Yanzhou?

804
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,300
The Young Master of Yanzhou

805
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,660
is just 15 years old.

806
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,900
How good could he be?

807
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,460
Betting on him is wasting money.

808
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,300
Exactly.

809
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,180
That's nonsense.

810
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,540
Yanzhou ran out of warriors?

811
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,580
They just sent a kid?

812
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,470
What did you...

813
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,260
That kid is visiting family in Wei.

814
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,220
Even if he loses,

815
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,070
it's no shame.

816
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,340
Right. Nothing to be ashamed of.

817
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,540
What do you all know anyway?

818
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,980
Have you ever seen Young Master Ci?

819
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,340
Although he's young,

820
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,980
he's really talented.

821
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,740
His spear technique is truly impressive.

822
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,580
But he didn't bring his spear

823
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,180
this time to Wei State...

824
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,580
He hasn't fought yet.

825
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,620
You're making excuses here?

826
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,260
Left his spear at home?

827
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,860
- Can't handle losing?
- Why bother?

828
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Are you betting or not?

829
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,700
Are you in or not?

830
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,340
I... I'm in. I'll bet right now.

831
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,210
- I'll bet on Yanzhou.
- Fine.

832
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,140
Go ahead.

833
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,420
I'll bet now.

834
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,700
Where's my money?

835
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,060
So you didn't bring any money, huh?

836
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,420
How can you bet without money?

837
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,060
I brought it. I just...

838
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,900
(Number One, Xiaotao, 400 taels)

839
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
I'll cover her bet.

840
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,180
Win, you claim the prize.

841
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,020
Lose, I bear the cost.

842
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,100
(Yanzhou warrior)

843
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,390
Sir,

844
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,500
you've got guts!

845
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,220
(Government Office)
Yaozhou wins.

846
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Duel report!

847
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,380
Duel report!

848
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,410
(Zhao Hong'en, Yenzhou)
- Who won? - Yaozhou did!

849
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:03,260
(Qin Qingshan, Yaozhou)

850
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,940
Yaozhou won.

851
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,700
Next up, the warrior from Yanzhou

852
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,460
versus warrior from Wushan!

853
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,340
Ci,

854
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,020
whether you lose or win,

855
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,140
win with grace and lose with dignity.

856
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,300
That's a true gentleman.

857
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,180
Yes, Manman.

858
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,060
Today's result

859
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,380
will shape our future.

860
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,740
Zixin,

861
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,860
you understand that?

862
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,020
Yes, Ehuang.

863
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,500
Place your bets.

864
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,340
Next round,

865
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,860
(Qiao Ci, Yanzhou)
Yanzhou versus Wushan!

866
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,340
- Yanzhou.
- Listen to me,

867
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
- Wushan will definitely win.
- Bets are final!

868
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,700
- Place your bets!
- Look.

869
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,940
Yanzhou will definitely win.

870
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,100
- Right.
- Wushan State will win.

871
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,940
Yanzhou will win!

872
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,100
I'll bet on Wushan State too.

873
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,660
