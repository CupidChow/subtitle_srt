30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,510
Inside is something

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,920
precious to you.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,200
To scar it with a knife

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,360
is to scar your heart.

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,760
Who could it be?

35
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,630
Yeah, that's it.

36
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,230
If Lady Qiao touched

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,920
the box herself,

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,600
we can't be blamed.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,950
Now that Lady Qiao

40
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,480
has crossed Shao's taboo,

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
no explanation will save her.

42
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,600
That wooden box

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,480
has been with Zhonglin for over ten years.

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,760
He's very attached to it.

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,160
Even the servants in the west wing aren't

46
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,600
allowed to move it during cleaning.

47
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,360
Honestly, I have no idea what's in it.

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,040
Could it be

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,710
some rare treasure?

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Whatever it is,

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Lady Qiao has clearly

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,670
angered Shao.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,060
Once he's angry, he'll surely

54
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,740
drive her from the main chamber.

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,900
Chuyu,

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,300
now,

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,060
you're the only one who truly

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,740
cares about me and gets me.

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,540
I lost my parents young.

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,420
If not for you, Aunt,

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,260
I'd have wandered homeless.

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,580
As long as you're happy,

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,260
I'd die to repay your kindness.

64
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,900
My Lady!

65
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
His Lordship is here!

66
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,860
Go, go, go.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,300
My Lord.

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,540
Mother.

69
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,940
Son, what brings you

70
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,300
here so suddenly?

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,780
I came here today,

72
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,820
hoping to seek your advice.

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,620
Come, have a seat.

74
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,540
Zhonglin,

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,500
what is it?

76
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,780
There's a box in my study.

77
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,740
The servants all know not to touch it.

78
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,220
But today,

79
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,820
I found scratches on it.

80
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,860
Someone clearly tried to pry it open.

81
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,660
Mother, do you know

82
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,460
anything about this?

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,380
Outrageous!

84
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,900
Who would dare?

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,500
If I ever find out who did this,

86
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,020
they're not getting away with it!

87
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,940
But Zhonglin,

88
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,500
have you asked Lady Qiao about this?

89
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,820
She knows best

90
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,220
what goes on in your study.

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,780
Mother, you think

92
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,980
it was Lady Qiao?

93
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm not accusing her.

94
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,620
I'm just worried

95
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,540
she's gotten arrogant

96
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,620
because of

97
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,020
your favor.

98
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,260
She may be tuning you out.

99
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,900
Or maybe

100
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,780
she got curious

101
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,260
and tried to

102
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,140
dig into your secrets.

103
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,580
Mother, you may not know.

104
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,060
That box only

105
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,700
held some of my old things.

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,260
Once I took them out,

107
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
the box was empty.

108
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,220
Lady Qiao saw the nine-square lock
thought it was interesting,

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,700
so she asked to keep it.

110
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,500
I showed her

111
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,860
how to open it.

112
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,300
She got bored after a few days.

113
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,660
Then she used it to store some jewelry.

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,340
And today,

115
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,780
this happened.

116
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,380
I've thought it over carefully.

117
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,020
If it wasn't someone with bad intentions,

118
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,020
then it was a thieving servant.

119
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,140
You've managed the household for years,

120
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,540
so you must know what to do.

121
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,140
I came to ask your advice.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,340
Alright,

123
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,180
I understand now.

124
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,540
Don't worry, son.

125
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,420
I'll look into it first thing tomorrow.

126
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,660
Very well, I'll leave it to you.

127
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,260
Please resolve it as soon as possible.

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,060
If it gets too complicated,

129
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,580
I can have Nanny Zhong

130
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,660
help you out.

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,620
No need, really. It's fine.

132
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,980
Also, about Zheng Shu,

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,180
I've got a solution

134
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,940
that works for both sides.

135
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,700
Since you want her to keep you company,

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,980
I'll find a good husband for her and have him

137
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,380
marry into our family.

138
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
That way,

139
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,780
her future is secured,

140
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,020
and she can stay by your side.

141
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,420
What do you think?

142
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,540
Zhonglin!

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,740
I know your kindness, son.

144
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,300
Let me

145
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,060
think about it.

146
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,460
Alright.

147
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,820
Once you decide,

148
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,900
let me know.

149
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,900
Just don't use this matter

150
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
to trouble Lady Qiao again.

151
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,460
After all,

152
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,660
she is the Lady of Wei.

153
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,780
Yes.

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,780
I have other matters,

155
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
so I'll take my leave.

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,900
Mr. Zhang said

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,420
he came to deliver gifts to Her Ladyship.

158
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,260
There's silk, chiffon,
brocade, satin, and damask,

159
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,140
(Inventory)
200 bolts of each,

160
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,700
totaling 1,000 bolts.

161
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,940
That's a lot of fabric.

162
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,340
If it were all made into dresses,

163
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,140
it'd be enough to last a lifetime.

164
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,180
Pick out some to send to His Lordship.

165
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Ten carts full from Yanzhou,

166
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,780
with gifts for Lady Zhu
and Lady Xu: fine-made gowns

167
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,300
and two sets of gold accessories.

168
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,060
Oh, and these two chests are from Lady Ding.

169
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,340
She specially prepared them for you, My Lady.

170
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,820
It's neither a festival

171
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,540
nor a special occasion.
Why send so many gifts now?

172
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
My Lady,

173
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,420
a letter from Yanzhou.

174
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,180
(Don't be anxious. Uphold feminine virtue.)

175
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,420
(The Boya conflict was not my doing.
I won't send troops.)

176
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,500
Where is Zhang Pu?

177
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,700
He is waiting outside.

178
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,260
(Yanzhou never betrays. From Qiao Yue.)

179
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,460
Cousin asked Yanzhou for aid.

180
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,260
Why can't Uncle see the bigger picture?

181
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,700
He refused to send troops

182
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,820
and completely ignored it.

183
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,060
If we miss this military window,

184
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,620
and fail to take Boya,

185
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,660
what future does our Qiao family have

186
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,460
if Lord of Wei turns on us?

187
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,420
"Future"?

188
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,860
We've already hit rock bottom.

189
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,620
I thought you'd forgotten

190
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,980
your own family in Yanzhou.

191
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,220
While His Lordship and I

192
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,580
were struggling in Kangjun,

193
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
we heard you

194
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,060
and Lord of Wei

195
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,180
were deeply in love.

196
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,740
If you hadn't insisted on giving Panyi

197
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,580
as dowry to Lord of Wei,

198
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,940
he wouldn't have stationed his troops there.

199
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,660
Now Yanzhou doesn't dare to make a move!

200
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,740
He stationed his troops in Panyi?

201
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,460
It's been over a month.

202
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,820
Troops have been coming in waves.

203
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,940
And I didn't even notice.

204
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,620
My Lady, His Lordship wanted to ask you

205
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,860
about Lord of Wei's intentions.

206
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,100
But now we see,

207
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,940
you were just kept in the dark.

208
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,740
Troops in Panyi?

209
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,020
Alright then.

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,340
I'll use Wei Shao's might

211
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,820
to plant the Qiao family flag in Boya.

212
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,460
My Lady, I'm afraid that's a pipe dream.

213
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,620
We'll see if I can make it happen.

214
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,620
(Bianzhou, Wei)

215
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
My Lady,

216
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
which of these fabrics

217
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,300
would suit His Lordship best?

218
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,700
None!

219
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,340
Did he marry me for some fabric?

220
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,340
So what did he marry you for?

221
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,180
A few more cities

222
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,340
might satisfy him.

223
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,380
No.

224
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,380
Even if I gave him more cities,

225
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
he'd never be satisfied.

226
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,900
Even if he swallowed me whole,

227
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,500
he's still want more.

228
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,660
Haven't seen you angry in a while, My Lady.

229
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,020
I'm not angry.

230
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,100
I just remembered
what Grandfather used to say.

231
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,260
Living each day...

232
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,060
Is like ruling a kingdom.

233
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,300
You want strong allies,

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,340
but not ones

235
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,940
too strong to control.

236
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,660
I should blame myself

237
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,740
for thinking I could ever live with him.

238
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,300
All he cares about is conquest.

239
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,100
This one looks nice too.

240
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,940
Look.

241
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,100
My Lady, His Lordship

242
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,980
said he's tied up with official matters,

243
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,100
so he won't be greeting you.

244
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,580
But Lady of Wei came here.

245
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,380
What is she doing here?

246
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,380
It must be about the wooden box.

247
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,060
Shao blamed you, and now

248
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,820
Lady Qiao's here to throw her weight around.

249
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
I have nothing to say to her.

250
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,660
Tell her I'm ill.

251
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,580
No need for visits

252
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,100
the next few days.

253
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,940
Yes.

254
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
My Lady, please return.

255
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,540
Lady Zhu isn't feeling well

256
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,620
and cannot receive guests.

257
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,700
You don't need to come these days.

258
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Lady Qiao just married in

259
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,140
and already sows discord
between Shao and you.

260
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,660
She even dares to complain to Shao.

261
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,580
Seems Lady Qiao

262
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,940
doesn't fear you at all.

263
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Who knows

264
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,580
what Zhonglin got questioned about by her?

265
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,860
Now he defends her at every turn.

266
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,420
There's no one close to Shao

267
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,900
to help him see right from wrong.

268
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,180
You're right about that.

269
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,260
What a pity.

270
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,980
Zhonglin is still too young.

271
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,220
He can't even tell

272
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,420
who's truly close to him.

273
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
Lady Zhu

274
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,760
- looked fine yesterday.
- What's she saying now?

275
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,300
Why is she suddenly sick today?

276
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,380
She must be tired.

277
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,860
She wants some peace. Let her rest.

278
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,340
I think she's just scared of you.

279
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,990
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

280
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,060
You sweep my courtyard all day.

281
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,740
Now Mother's fallen ill.
Shouldn't you be serving her?

282
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,300
I wonder am I allowed

283
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,420
to dismiss you now?

284
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,700
My Lady, what do you mean by this?

285
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,500
You've been spying in my courtyard,

286
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
but you didn't even know Mother's ill?

287
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

288
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,580
My Lady,

289
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,940
that's impressive.

290
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,500
No one's eavesdropping now.

291
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
I dismissed them

292
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,620
so you can rant all you want.

293
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,420
I'll be careful with my words. I swear.

294
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,260
My Lord, are you eating now?

295
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,380
You had this prepared before I even asked?

296
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,020
Her Ladyship arranged it.

297
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,860
It's still warm.

298
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,660
Something wrong with the food?

299
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,100
No, not at all.

300
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,180
They're all my favorites.

301
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,380
She's always

302
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,940
been thoughtful.

303
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,860
How's the new bedding? Comfortable?

304
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,820
Her Ladyship said if you like it,

305
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,860
she'll prepare thicker ones

306
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,140
when the weather turns cold.

307
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,820
Her Ladyship also said

308
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,860
she's mastered

309
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,960
Lady Zhu's stitching technique

310
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,820
and returned them.

311
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,860
Hope they're comfortable.

312
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,580
By the way, someone said

313
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,980
Lady Zhu isn't feeling well

314
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,340
and asked you to visit her.

315
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,500
Alright.

316
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,340
I'll eat later.

317
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,500
I'll go now.

318
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,980
Zhonglin,

319
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,980
last time

320
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,060
was all my fault.

321
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,100
Will you forgive me, son?

322
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,780
Of course I will.

323
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
I just want you to know,

324
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,580
only your wife

325
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,420
walks with you to the end.

326
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,820
Though she's not your blood,

327
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,900
she's your closest companion and true love.

328
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,220
My closest companion

329
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,540
and true love.

330
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,460
Yes, that's right.

331
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,100
But sadly,

332
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,900
you married Lady Qiao.

333
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,420
She doesn't care about you.

334
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm afraid

335
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,460
she doesn't even know

336
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,900
what you like, what you eat,

337
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,860
or your shoe size.

338
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,900
These two...

339
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
My Lord?

340
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,380
Sir,

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,220
there's something

342
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,900
I'd like to ask you.

343
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,420
Please, go ahead.

344
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,500
Sir,

345
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,300
may I ask you, what is a closest

346
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,740
companion and true love really like?

347
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,100
A closest companion and true love?

348
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,140
My Lord, think carefully about this.

349
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,220
Is Lady Xu

350
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,260
your closest companion

351
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,820
and true love?

352
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,220
She helped you become the family head,

353
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,820
took over the late lord's duties,

354
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,140
and kept the household in order for decades.

355
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,500
Grandmother

356
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,100
is indeed close to me.

357
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,540
She places

358
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,100
her expectations on me.

359
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,820
With expectations

360
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,420
come obligations.

361
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,900
So, what I feel for her

362
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,940
is love,

363
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,460
the respectful kind.

364
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,380
What about Lady Zhu?

365
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,780
My mother?

366
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm dutiful to her.

367
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,500
My Lord, do you think I,

368
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
your advisor, am that person?

369
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,980
Sir, to me,

370
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,580
you're like a teacher,

371
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,420
and a father.

372
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,420
What I feel

373
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,460
for you

374
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,220
is trust.

375
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,180
If I truly saw you

376
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,820
as my closest companion and true love...

377
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,820
That'd be too much pressure.

378
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,380
What about those generals?

379
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
They've fought beside you.

380
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,460
Are they your closest companions?
Do you love them?

381
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,940
True.

382
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,940
They've fought with me

383
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,580
for years.

384
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,540
In my eyes,

385
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,740
they're like my brothers.

386
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,620
I hope that someday, the war will end,

387
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,060
and they can live in peace.

388
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,740
In time,

389
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,020
they'll have lives of their own.

390
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,700
They can go their own way.

391
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,340
If they wish to leave,

392
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
I won't stop them.

393
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
My Lord,

394
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,300
you've turned everyone away.

395
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,100
I believe, deep down,

396
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,660
you already have an answer.

397
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,460
I truly don't.

398
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,580
That's why I ask, sir.

399
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
My Lord, please look.

400
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,460
(Closest)

401
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,940
The left side of

402
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,060
the character "Qin"
[*Closest]

403
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,260
means blood,

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,340
while the right side

405
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,260
means "to see".

406
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,220
So the one closest to you

407
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,460
should be someone

408
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,940
who sees what you see,

409
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,060
and feels what you feel.

410
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,020
(Love)

411
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,460
Now, look at "Ai".
[*Love]

412
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,820
It combines

413
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,460
endurance, devotion,

414
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,060
and friendship.

415
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,780
This person

416
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,860
must be patient with you,

417
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,900
willing to care,

418
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,940
not fear you,

419
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,260
and share

420
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,700
mutual respect and fondness.

421
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,300
Things you don't want to tell others,

422
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,620
you can tell her.

423
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,420
Matters you don't want others to handle,

424
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,900
you can leave to her.

425
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,500
And you can show

426
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
your vulnerability to her.

427
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,740
I think Lady of Wei

428
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,020
is wise and gentle.

429
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,980
She's got some impressive qualities.

430
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,060
Please stop bringing her up, sir.

431
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,260
She's sharp-tongued,

432
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,460
not gentle at all.

433
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,820
You wrongly accused her
of reading the military intel,

434
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,860
yet she defended herself

435
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,380
without fear.

436
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,460
That means Her Ladyship trusts you

437
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,020
and feels she can confide in you.

438
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Have you forgotten

439
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,660
how persistent she was back then?

440
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,460
And in daily life?

441
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,500
Hasn't Lady of Wei cared for you?

442
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,980
Despite your authority,

443
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,940
has Lady of Wei

444
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,980
ever shown fear?

445
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,300
Come on, Advisor.

446
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,060
Give it a rest. Stop bringing her up.

447
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,500
We married for political reasons.

448
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,540
How could she be...

449
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,740
my closest companion and true love?

450
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,540
(Love)

451
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,860
(Love)

452
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,660
Her Ladyship hasn't gone to bed?

453
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,100
She's copying sutras for Lady Xu.

454
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,220
Lady Xu loves The Infinite Life Sutra
she copied.

455
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,300
Would you like to go in?

456
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,740
No.

457
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,180
Have the kitchen

458
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,780
prepare ginseng soup for her.

459
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,220
Yes.

460
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,420
(Wei Mansion)

461
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
You didn't go to
Government Office today, My Lord?

462
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,460
I'll head over soon.

463
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,820
Are you going to visit Grandmother?

464
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,980
Yes.

465
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,860
I'll go with you.

466
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,700
- Tan?
- Yes, My Lord.

467
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm hungry.

468
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,460
I'll have the kitchen prepare food now.

469
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,100
Tell Her Ladyship to prepare it

470
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,660
and bring it to me herself.

471
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,540
♪Fate walks with me, still I feign no care♪

472
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,820
My Lady.

473
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,260
Take these in to His Lordship.

474
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,380
See if he likes them.

475
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,220
Yes.

476
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,820
Her Ladyship sent over these dim sum.

477
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,620
She wants to know if they suit your taste.

478
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,660
Where is she?

479
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
At the door.

480
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,900
Why isn't she coming in?

481
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,500
I forgot to ask. Please wait.

482
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,460
Tell him he's busy with state affairs.

483
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,700
I don't want to disturb him.

484
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,140
Yes.

485
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
My Lord,

486
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,180
she says she doesn't want to

487
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,100
bother you with work.

488
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,500
Go tell her,

489
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,020
if something's wrong
with the dim sum, I'd like to

490
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,820
speak to her in person. Let her in.

491
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,660
Yes.

492
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,340
My Lady,

493
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,500
he says if he doesn't like them, he wants

494
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,420
to tell you in person.

495
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
Please go in.

496
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,180
But how could he not like them?

497
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,660
The kitchen made them just the way he likes.

498
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,980
My Lord, Her Ladyship said

499
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,020
they were made the way you like.

500
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,700
No way you don't like them.

501
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,620
Then why does she want to know
if I like them?

502
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
Putting on a show, huh?

503
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
You...

504
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,740
Tell her to come in.

505
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,100
I want to talk to her.

506
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,980
I wouldn't dare go in.

507
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,580
Who knows what mood he's in today?

508
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,260
What if I upset him

509
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,860
or offend him?

510
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,260
Tan.

511
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm hungry.

512
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,170
My Lord, Her Ladyship

513
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,660
sent dim sum this afternoon.

514
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,660
You haven't had any yet.

515
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,300
Tell her to make me a fresh late-night snack.

516
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,460
And

517
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,020
bring it herself.

518
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
Yes.

519
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,860
What's wrong with him?

520
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,100
Isn't he just picking on me on purpose?

521
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,940
Why eat so late at night?

522
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,940
Xiaozao, go to the kitchen.

523
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,900
Grab anything for him.

524
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,940
Just take it over.

525
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,780
Yes.

526
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,220
He's sent for me twice today.

527
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
Could he have found out about Boya?

528
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
No way.

529
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,020
I've cleaned the bamboo slips

530
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,300
you drafted secretly.

531
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,180
And I've put away

532
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,620
the Map of Boya you drew.

533
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,180
How could he have found out?

534
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,940
You take this in to him.

535
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,220
My Lady, please don't make it hard for me.

536
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,700
Tan.

537
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,780
My Lady.

538
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,500
I've brought the food.

539
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,660
You take it in to him.

540
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,940
Please don't make it hard for me.

541
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,060
So, neither of you will go?

542
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,820
I'll just leave it here.

543
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,620
Please call him out to get it.

544
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,220
Sorry, I've offended you again.

545
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,140
Please punish me.

546
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,460
You didn't offend me.

547
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,900
Didn't you say I should come get it?

548
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,820
Here I am.

549
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,180
Why have you been avoiding me?

550
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,660
I'm not avoiding you.

551
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
If something's bothering you,

552
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,260
just tell me.

553
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,220
Thank you for your concern.

554
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,180
This is for you.

555
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,340
My Lady,

556
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,260
I heard from Tan.

557
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,340
This is a rare armrest.

558
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,900
Did His Lordship see
the ink stain on your hands

559
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,940
and gift this for your writing?

560
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,780
He asked if his mother troubled me.

561
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,860
Maybe he feels guilty about that day

562
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,540
and wants to make peace.

563
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,860
Well, His Lordship does seem reasonable.

564
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,180
If he really feels guilty,

565
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,860
I have an idea.

566
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
But it'll cost me a bit of silver.

567
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,620
Isn't that easy?

568
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,340
Here.

569
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,700
I have plenty.

570
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,380
And I have more.

571
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,260
Where did you get so much?

572
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,260
Half the street out there
belongs to Qiao now.

573
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,500
Don't worry, My Lady.

574
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,700
You'll never run short of silver.

575
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,140
No wonder you're always out and about.

576
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,100
What are we buying?

577
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,060
A zither.

578
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,860
Why do we need a zither?

579
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,340
I miss Cousin.

580
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,780
No problem.

581
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,820
How much are we spending?

582
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,900
As long as it plays, it's fine.

583
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,700
Well...

584
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
Alright.

585
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,660
Her Ladyship is waiting for you to eat.

586
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,740
What's going on here?

587
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,420
My Lord.

588
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,220
What's this?

589
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm not a good player.

590
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,660
Sorry you had to see that.

591
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,500
Yeah, you're not.

592
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,500
From now on,

593
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,940
I'll practice every day.

594
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,580
I don't think that's necessary.

595
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,860
Let's eat.

596
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,500
Let's eat.

597
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,740
Why are you crying?

598
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,620
I told you,

599
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,380
if something's bothering you, just tell me.

600
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,540
Go on.

601
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,940
What's wrong?

602
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,900
It's...

603
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,700
It's Cousin.

604
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,580
She's skilled at playing the konghou.

605
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,460
Before she left,

606
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,620
she gave me this instrument.

607
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,580
While unpacking the things I brought

608
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,980
back from Yanzhou, I saw it again

609
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,260
and couldn't help missing her.

610
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,380
Cousin's kindness is still
so clear in my mind.

611
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
You're quite close

612
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,540
with your cousin.

613
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,660
Yes.

614
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,740
She wrote to me.

615
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,620
Since she eloped with Bi Zhi,

616
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,980
they're living a hard life now,

617
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,420
while I'm here enjoying

618
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,620
comfort and luxury.

619
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,420
I feel terrible about it.

620
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,180
That's not so hard to fix.

621
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,260
Just send her some supplies.

622
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,380
Help her make things easier.

623
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,460
But who would do that?

624
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,380
She eloped.

625
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,660
Even my uncle disowned her.

626
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,420
Don't worry, I'll have someone do it.

627
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
Really?

628
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,420
Yeah.

629
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,220
Where is she now?

630
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,220
She's in...

631
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,060
Boya.

632
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,900
Boya?

633
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
My Lord,

634
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,060
do you think it's too far?

635
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,420
I was just wondering

636
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,820
why are they in Boya?

637
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,420
Cousin and Bi Zhi

638
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,620
don't have any papers
to prove their identity.

639
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,900
They can't enter any proper city.

640
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,180
So they must be staying

641
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,060
somewhere remote,
outside of authority's reach,

642
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,900
just to survive.

643
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,500
My Lord,

644
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,580
do you still stand by your word?

645
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,820
Of course I do.

646
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
Here's the thing.

647
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,980
Pack up whatever you

648
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,060
want to send her. I'll have

649
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
someone deliver it.

650
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,780
Alright.

651
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,820
I have no way to thank you,

652
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,220
but I'll practice konghou every day,

653
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,100
until I'm good enough to play for you.

654
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,660
That's really not necessary.

655
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,100
It's not your thing.

656
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,580
Eating is. Dig in.

657
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,220
Want me to play it again?

658
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,060
No need.

659
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,460
Just eat.

660
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,820
Why are we delivering things

661
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,180
for Her Ladyship's cousin?

662
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,380
My Lord,

663
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,460
don't let beauty cloud your judgment.

664
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,380
It's a waste of talent.

665
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,820
That's right, My Lord.

666
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,180
This trip may seem like

667
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,540
a supply run.

668
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,380
But since we don't know much about

669
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,660
the Commander of Boya Forces,

670
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,860
it's the perfect opportunity

671
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,180
to scout him out.

672
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,420
Smart move, My Lord.

673
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,020
Alright, you go ahead and decide

674
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:47,940
who will go then.

675
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,940
Come on, let's draw straws.

676
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,140
Drawing straws again?

677
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,660
I never win at this.

678
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,180
Are you setting me up?

679
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,380
Don't think so low of me.

680
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,240
- Get lost.
- Here,

681
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,120
put it in your hand.

682
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,420
I'll draw from you, fair enough?

683
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,740
Draw.

684
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,700
Looks like this tough task

685
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
falls on me in the end.

686
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,460
Better than you thinking I cheated.

687
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,380
This trip isn't for battle,

688
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,740
just for scouting.

689
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,180
What a show.

690
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,020
It's even grander than your wedding parade.

691
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,940
I still think it's not enough.

692
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,020
More people means better support for Cousin.

693
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,940
When you get there,

694
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,340
keep it discreet.

695
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,380
We don't want rumors

696
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,940
of Wei attacking Boya.

697
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,740
Rest assured, My Lord. I understand.

698
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,220
Take care of yourself.

699
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't worry.

700
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,860
My Lord, you prepared so much for Cousin.

701
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
It's just to put you at ease.

702
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,660
So you won't be sad again.

703
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,780
These are rice seeds I brought for Cousin.

704
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,820
Even if they're drifting around,

705
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,380
they can survive by farming.

706
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,820
Please be sure to give these rice seeds

707
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,820
to Cousin.

708
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,940
Don't worry.

709
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,460
I saw you brought many servants.

710
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,940
If Cousin needs help,

711
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,180
please let them lend a hand.

712
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,420
Don't worry, My Lady.

713
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,660
All right, head out.

714
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,500
Okay.

715
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,820
Why is he so eager this time?

716
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,780
He's a good buddy.

717
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,460
Took the tough job himself.

718
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,500
Boya has mountains, beasts,

719
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,540
and local wine.

720
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,780
Not just him,

721
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,860
I'd like to go too.

722
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,860
Alright. Head out.

723
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,860
(Boya)

724
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,260
The terrain in Boya is tricky,

725
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,180
mountains over here, forests over there.

726
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,820
Hang in there, guys.

727
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,740
We're almost there.

728
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,300
Let's see if we can get some meat tonight.

729
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,340
Give me the bow.

730
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,580
Hyah!

731
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,780
Whoa.

732
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,550
Who are you?

733
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
I hit this boar.

734
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,580
Why are you taking it?

735
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,540
It was my arrow that hit it.

736
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,660
How is it yours?

737
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,940
You bandit,

738
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,260
quite impressive, huh?

739
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,820
If you want it,

740
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,260
I'll give it to you.

741
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,580
Boars are hard to find.

742
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,980
You'd just give it up?

743
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,300
If you need some meat,

744
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,660
just take it.

745
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,300
I'll hunt another one.

746
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,140
May I ask, hero,

747
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,180
what is your name?

748
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,420
I'm Bi Zhi.

749
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,460
One green eye, one black eye.

750
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,460
Bi Zhi,

751
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,700
I'm Wei Qu from Wei State.

752
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,020
We're here for you.

753
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,740
General Wei.

754
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,780
Miss.

755
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,940
Lord of Wei sent you here?

756
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,220
Her Ladyship misses you deeply.

757
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,420
His Lordship is worried about her.

758
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,420
So they sent us here

759
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,700
- with supplies.
- Thank you.

760
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,700
Thank you.

761
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,780
Wei Qu.

762
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,780
General Bi Zhi.

763
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,100
You brought us so many things.

764
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,180
Here, have some water.

765
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,020
General Bi Zhi,

766
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,460
back in Yujun

767
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,220
I heard stories of your bravery.

768
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,340
Who would've thought
the Commander of Boya Forces

769
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,540
is family?

770
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,740
You flatter me.

771
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,580
Cousin,

772
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,700
reading this letter is seeing me.

773
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,460
Xue Tai's crisis can be eased by others.

774
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,340
Bianzhou is far, surrounded
by rugged mountains.

775
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,940
Xue Tai's troops are exhausted

776
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,420
and fear being outnumbered.

777
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,100
Cousin, have Bi Zhi position
Lord of Wei troops

778
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,500
on high ground

779
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,140
and create the illusion of a large troop.

780
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,180
Victory shall be ours without a fight.

781
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,540
Raise the Qiao family flag

782
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
and take Boya.

783
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
This will keep
the Wei family at bay for years.

784
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,740
The fate of Yanzhou depends on this.

785
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,140
We must give it our all.

786
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,660
Manman.

787
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,090
Put it over there.

788
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,140
Be quick!

789
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,200
Alright.

790
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,270
Careful there.

791
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,230
Put it over there.

792
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,820
Report!

793
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,900
General, a group of

794
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,960
over 100 men,

795
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,820
escorting 20 carts, has arrived in Boya.

796
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,460
They linked up with the green-eyed bandit.

797
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,860
Locals say

798
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,900
they came from

799
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,340
Yujun, Wei State.

800
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,260
Wei State?

801
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,020
Civilians or soldiers?

802
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,260
Word is, Lady Qiao's sister

803
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,740
is delivering supplies from Yujun.

804
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,740
But she's married to Wei Shao, Lord of Wei.

805
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,460
Hard to tell if they're

806
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,460
civilians or soldiers.

807
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,620
Wei Shao has

808
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,260
already taken Panyi.

809
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,020
Now he wants Boya too?

810
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,460
Scout again and report.

811
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
Yes.

812
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,260
Didn't you say His Lordship
doesn't suit the fabric?

813
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,820
Why do you change your mind

814
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,140
and pick fabric again?

815
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,300
He says he has headaches.

816
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,140
Maybe it's the pillow.

817
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm picking something softer.

818
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,620
These fabrics are fine,

819
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
but not comfortable to the touch.

820
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,740
My Lady,

821
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,420
this is fine fabric from Lady Ding

822
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,980
in Yanzhou.

823
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,540
You wouldn't use them yourself,

824
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,020
but you want to make
something for His Lordship.

825
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,460
He's sent so many things to Cousin.

826
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,340
Of course, I must return the gesture.

827
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,020
Very good, My Lady.

828
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,410
My Lady,

829
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,140
please choose a fabric.

830
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Let me feel them.

831
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,900
How about this one?

832
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,340
It's too stiff.

833
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,420
Try this one.

834
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,460
This one's much softer.

835
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,820
Let's go with this one.

836
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,900
Alright, we'll use this fabric.

837
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,180
My Lord,

838
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,020
General Wei Qu has sent word.

839
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,620
He's arrived at the borders of Boya

840
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,820
and met the Commander of Boya Forces.

841
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,020
So soon?

842
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,860
So, who is this Commander of Boya Forces?

843
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,020
He's your brother-in-law,

844
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,220
Bi Zhi.

845
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,460
It's him?

846
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,380
That's interesting.

847
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,060
No one pays much heed to Boya.

848
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,340
Now it's under Bi Zhi's control.

849
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,660
He's both Qiao Yue's son-in-law

850
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,220
and your brother-in-law.

851
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,980
Whose side he picks

852
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,780
will decide whether Boya belongs to

853
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,420
Qiao or Wei.

854
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,300
Please, sir, speak your mind.

855
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,260
General Wei Qu went

856
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,060
at Her Ladyship's request.

857
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,620
What exactly did she

858
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,740
mean by that?

859
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,780
What meaning could there be?

860
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,820
If Her Ladyship knew Bi Zhi

861
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,220
was the Commander of Boya Forces,

862
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,540
she would've told me.

863
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,940
Don't worry,

864
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,220
she wouldn't hide it.

865
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,540
You're home early today.

866
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,540
(Wise Kashyapa Who Governs Eternally)

867
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,380
I am.

868
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,620
To congratulate you.

869
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,700
Why is that?

870
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,100
Do you know

871
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,540
who the Commander of Boya Forces is?

872
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,900
Who is it?

873
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Your brother-in-law.

874
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,860
Bi Zhi.

875
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,060
You must be joking, My Lord.

876
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,620
My brother-in-law is just a stableman.
