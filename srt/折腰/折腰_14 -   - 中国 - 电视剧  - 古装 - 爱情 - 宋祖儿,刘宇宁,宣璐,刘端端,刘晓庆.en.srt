=Episode 14=

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,720
There is Lady Yulou.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
So noble.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,220
(Yujun)

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
- Lady Yulou.
- Lady Yulou.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,210
Sorry to keep you waiting.

35
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,910
This is my cousin, Su Xin,
whose style name is Zixin.

36
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,840
These are generals Wei Liang and Wei Qu.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
Say hi to both generals.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
Nice to meet you.

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,290
To make it in time
for Great-aunt's 60th birthday,

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,210
I came in a hurry

41
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,610
lest I might cause trouble.

42
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,680
I didn't expect

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,010
the Lord of Wei to send you two

44
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,210
to receive me outside the city.

45
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't deserve this.

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,890
Lady Yulou,

47
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,450
you're too kind.

48
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,290
It's getting late.

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,930
Let me escort you into the city.

50
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,400
What a beautiful carriage.

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,800
Who's inside?

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,610
That's Lady Yulou's carriage.

53
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,120
The legendary Lady Yulou?

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,490
The one with the peony mark?

55
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,080
Lady Su of Wushan.

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,060
Her fate is exceptional.

57
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,640
She was born noble.

58
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,890
No wonder the generals
came to welcome her.

59
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,640
She really is a belle.

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,730
So beautiful.

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,330
They try to imitate you,

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,610
but they can never succeed.

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,450
So many believe in fate,

64
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,330
but how many understand

65
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,900
that nothing comes easily

66
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,400
in this world?

67
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,290
Even gifts from heaven

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,010
require one's own effort.

69
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,330
What I have today

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,170
was not easily earned.

71
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,360
The foolish believe

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,120
that they can obtain

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,580
your empress's fate
by wearing a huadian.

74
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,520
But they don't know
that fate is hard to change.

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,490
You've borne the destiny

76
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,490
of the Su Clan of Wushan
since childhood.

77
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,490
Guided by great scholars,

78
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,730
your vision is extraordinary.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,360
How could common women ever compare?

80
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,610
That's not entirely fair.

81
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,010
If I fail to break the Qiao-Wei alliance
on this trip,

82
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,360
then in my husband's eyes,

83
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,770
I'm no different
from those common women.

84
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,930
Is this the place

85
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,170
the Lord of Wei
has arranged for us to stay?

86
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,880
Yes.
This is the best post house in Yujun.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
(Yujun Post House, Wei State)

88
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,650
Lady Yulou,

89
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,560
are you dissatisfied?

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,290
Not at all.

91
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,200
This place,

92
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
peaceful amidst the bustle,

93
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,360
is just what I wanted.

94
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,850
The Lord of Wei is thoughtful.

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,730
Lady Xu said you've had a long journey

96
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,560
and may rest here first.

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
No need to rush to the mansion.

98
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,490
This...

99
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,390
Didn't you say the Lord of Wei

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,240
would have us stay at the mansion?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,440
Why is it the post house instead?

102
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,880
It must be Lady Qiao's idea.

103
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,880
Gorgeous huadian!

104
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,000
Once you put it on,

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
you'll meet a man in one day

106
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
(Rouge)
get married in three days,

107
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,170
and find a devoted man in ten days.

108
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,730
Gentlemen,

109
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,360
buy one for the lady at home.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,680
This is the hottest trend
in Yujun right now.

111
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,120
I don't need that to win a girl's heart.

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
Let's go.

113
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
Give me

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,840
- the most popular one.
- Sure.

115
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,160
- How much?
- Three wen.

116
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,770
Do you really believe
what that seller says?

117
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,690
Xiaotao surely doesn't want
something like that.

118
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,490
She won't like it.

119
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,050
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,050
It's not for Xiaotao.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,930
Can't I wear it myself?

122
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,490
What's wrong, Duang?

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
Here, take this.

124
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,080
This...

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Why do you have one too?

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,930
Girls in Yujun now

127
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,880
love this huadian.

128
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,560
After I escorted Lady Yulou,

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,150
I picked one up for you on my way back.

130
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,930
Why do girls like
this kind of thing now?

131
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,800
Who says we do?

132
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,530
Whoever wants this cheap stuff

133
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,680
can have it.

134
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,650
Alright, alright.

135
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,010
Don't pick it up.

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,970
Okay, I won't.

137
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
I get it. You don't want it.

138
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,850
Why are you angry?

139
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,680
What do you know?

140
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,490
Let me ask you something.

141
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,200
Answer me honestly.

142
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,580
I heard Lady Yulou

143
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,320
was almost betrothed to the Wei family.

144
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,290
Is it true?

145
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes.

146
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,490
Does she like it

147
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,760
or not?

148
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,730
My Lady,

149
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,320
Lady Yulou has come to pay her respects.

150
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,490
Let her in.

151
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,320
- Yes.
- Ask Lady Zhu

152
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,560
to come and meet our guest.

153
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Yes.

154
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,990
Grandmother, you have a guest.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,560
I'll take my leave.

156
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,600
You stay.

157
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,440
It's fine.

158
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
By seniority,

159
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,260
she should call me

160
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,660
Great-aunt.

161
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
When she was young,

162
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,500
we were very close.

163
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,660
Sure.

164
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,420
Greetings,

165
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,740
Great-aunt.

166
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Get up.

167
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
Take a seat.

168
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,100
Thank you, Great-aunt.

169
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,700
I heard your husband is gravely ill.

170
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,860
I'm only celebrating a birthday,

171
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,420
yet you came all this way.

172
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Great-aunt,

173
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,540
though I am

174
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,180
the Lady of Bianzhou,

175
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,220
I'm bound by many constraints,

176
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,700
walking on thin ice.

177
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,940
I often recall my childhood

178
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,460
when you were always

179
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,180
so kind to me.

180
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
This year, I missed you too much,

181
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,220
so I came in haste.

182
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,380
I only hope

183
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,740
I haven't disturbed your peace.

184
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,580
If you're here to unwind,

185
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,100
then stay and relax.

186
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,820
Thank you, Great-aunt.

187
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,060
This is Lady Qiao,

188
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,740
Zhonglin's wife.

189
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,060
She's excellent
at managing the household.

190
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,940
I've long heard

191
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,220
the Lady of Wei

192
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,940
is as radiant as the sun.

193
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,340
Now that I've met you,

194
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,460
you're truly captivating.

195
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
I was caught up

196
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,540
chatting with Great-aunt.

197
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,700
Sorry for neglecting you.

198
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,580
Please

199
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,640
accept my apology.

200
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,460
I hope we can

201
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,620
spend more time together

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,580
so today's meeting won't be in vain.

203
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,940
You're too kind, Lady Yulou.

204
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
I feel the same.

205
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,700
No need to be so formal.

206
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,420
I grew up with the Lord of Wei.

207
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,420
You can just call me Ehuang.

208
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,940
You're now

209
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,700
the Lady of Bianzhou.

210
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm still young.

211
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,580
I dare not lose decorum.

212
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,700
It's only proper to address you
as Lady Yulou.

213
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,420
You're a Qiao,
even more noble than I am.

214
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,300
Lord Qiao's reputation for benevolence

215
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,940
is known throughout the land.

216
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,300
I spoke out of turn.

217
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,740
Great-aunt, please forgive me.

218
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,940
My Lady,

219
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,060
Lady Zhu is here.

220
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Greetings, Mother.

221
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,980
Ehuang,

222
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,220
long time no see.

223
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,540
You look more and more blessed.

224
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
As expected of the Lady of Bianzhou.

225
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,340
You flatter me.

226
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,060
Since we parted ways in Yujun,

227
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
I didn't expect

228
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,100
to only see you again now.

229
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,740
You always treated me
like your daughter.

230
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,220
In Bianzhou,

231
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,580
I often thought back

232
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,580
and couldn't help but weep.

233
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,060
Back then, I had no choice.

234
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,900
Look at me,

235
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,580
chatting on and almost forgetting

236
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,180
the main reason I came.

237
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Great-aunt,

238
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,220
I heard Rongjun is suffering famine

239
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
so I brought some grain

240
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,100
along with me

241
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,060
as a gift for your birthday.

242
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,580
I hope

243
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,700
you won't find it unworthy.

244
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,620
Grain

245
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,460
is no trivial matter.

246
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,820
This must be decided

247
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,940
by Zhonglin.

248
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,820
He'll accept it.

249
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,660
They grew up together

250
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,580
after all.

251
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,340
Ehuang,

252
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,860
you're so thoughtful toward Zhonglin.

253
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,220
How touching.

254
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,700
This is what family means.

255
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,560
Enough with the chatter.

256
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,580
Grandmother, you must be tired.

257
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,940
I'll take my leave

258
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,300
and serve you another day.

259
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,700
You're thoughtful.

260
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,460
Everyone

261
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
should go rest now.

262
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,540
Yes.

263
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
My Lady,

264
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Lady Yulou looks

265
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,700
much fuller than before.

266
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,580
Yet she claimed

267
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,100
she was constrained and had a hard time

268
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,460
in Bianzhou.

269
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,460
She used

270
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,820
to care for the Lord

271
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,580
meticulously.

272
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,860
I once thought she had feelings for him.

273
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,340
Who would've thought

274
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,540
she'd marry the Lord of Bianzhou

275
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,820
just a couple of years

276
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,460
after the Xindu incident?

277
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,980
She was planning for her future.

278
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,420
Nothing's wrong with that.

279
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I guess she and I

280
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,700
just weren't fated.

281
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,340
I find

282
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,740
the Lady of Wei

283
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,180
quite clever and capable.

284
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,180
You've worked hard for years.

285
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,980
You can finally enjoy some peace.

286
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,460
Peace?

287
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,740
That's not in my fate.

288
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,180
I only hope Lady Qiao

289
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,420
lets me

290
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,860
live a quiet life.

291
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,300
Why do you say that?

292
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,860
Just now,

293
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,220
I saw how much Great-aunt

294
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,700
favored her.

295
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,300
I thought...

296
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
If you saw it in one day,

297
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,620
you can imagine

298
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,610
how things usually are for me.

299
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,420
Mother is always overbearing.

300
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,860
Lady Qiao acts all delicate.

301
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,860
She even fooled Zhonglin

302
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,700
into driving Chuyu

303
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,100
out of the house.

304
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,580
Now,

305
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,340
the two of them stand united.

306
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,700
I'm the only outsider left

307
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,580
in this home.

308
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,340
Why doesn't Zhonglin

309
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,220
speak up for you?

310
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,460
He's busy.

311
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,740
He was fixing the Yongning Canal,

312
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,700
and now he's working

313
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,100
on the canal for Rongjun.

314
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,100
I can't help with those things.

315
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,980
I just try not to add to his burden.

316
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,580
Only a mother
thinks this way for her son.

317
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,820
No one else would.

318
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,740
That's true.

319
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,580
You understand me best.

320
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,060
If only you could stay longer this time,

321
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,540
so we could have

322
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,580
a proper talk.

323
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,180
You just said the Lord of Wei

324
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,740
was working on the canal for Rongjun.

325
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,340
Didn't the canal for Xindu and Panyi

326
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,740
just get completed?

327
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,300
Why the rush to divert water to Rongjun?

328
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,300
Are there some problems?

329
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,980
Maybe I can help.

330
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,100
I heard Rongjun suffered from drought.

331
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,060
Yanzhou

332
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,860
is sending wheat seeds,

333
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,300
so they need the canal.

334
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,300
What can we women do

335
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,940
about these things?

336
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
I once suggested to Lady Yulou

337
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,940
that she meet you at the office,

338
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,320
but she insisted

339
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,480
on coming here.

340
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
It's fine.

341
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Lady Yulou.

342
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,420
Long time no see.

343
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,060
You're now the Lord of Wei.

344
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
Do you remember?

345
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,420
Back then, we and Bogong

346
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,980
used to play in this very courtyard.

347
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,340
How carefree and happy.

348
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,700
After so many years,

349
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,220
this place has fallen into dilapidation,

350
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,340
yet standing here

351
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,220
feels like just yesterday.

352
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,740
Yes.

353
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,420
It truly does.

354
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,940
Though I was born in Wushan,

355
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,420
my happiest childhood days

356
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,100
were spent with you guys.

357
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,700
Now returning to Wei

358
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,580
feels almost like coming home.

359
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,620
Indeed,

360
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,740
Wei can be considered

361
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,340
your second home.

362
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,420
The day I arrived at the mansion,

363
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,860
I learned the Lady of Wei

364
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,460
has been taking care of Great-aunt

365
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,700
and managing the household meticulously.

366
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Lady Qiao

367
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,940
is gentle and considerate,

368
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,100
kind and wise.

369
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,820
She must've given so much.

370
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,540
Yes.

371
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
She has worked hard.

372
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,940
More than just hard.

373
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,060
It pains me to think of it.

374
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,180
I heard

375
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,540
Lady Qiao was much loved at home,

376
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,700
never having to worry about anything.

377
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,940
Yet she's here now,

378
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,740
handling so much.

379
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,780
Zhonglin,

380
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,580
here's a piece of advice.

381
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,220
Managing the household is hard enough.

382
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,820
Don't let Lady Qiao worry

383
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,980
about the grudges

384
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,340
and political affairs

385
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,780
between the Qiaos and Weis anymore.

386
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,500
(Birthday Banquet Guest List)

387
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,380
I keep wondering these days:

388
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,100
Why did Lady Yulou

389
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,380
suddenly show up

390
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,180
after all these years of absence?

391
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,140
Could you explain further?

392
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,980
She came with grain.

393
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,340
She must have a purpose.

394
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,260
I've already asked Uncle for seeds.

395
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,740
If the Lord

396
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,660
accepts her grain now,

397
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,860
it'll be a shame to Yanzhou.

398
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,260
I know Rongjun is in drought,

399
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,820
and Yanzhou offering seeds

400
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,340
was Lady Qiao's way

401
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,780
of easing the tension
between the two clans.

402
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,200
Still, we can't rule out

403
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,420
the ill intent

404
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,660
of the Qiao Clan.

405
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,980
This time I came

406
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,500
not just to celebrate
Great-aunt's birthday

407
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,580
but also to do my part

408
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,780
to help Wei.

409
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,340
I brought grain

410
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,740
to aid Rongjun

411
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,820
through the drought.

412
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,020
This batch of grain

413
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,620
is not from Wushan

414
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,420
or Bianzhou.

415
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,340
It's simply a gift from me personally.

416
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,780
Please don't feel pressured.

417
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,780
If Yanzhou and Wei join hands

418
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,300
to open the canal in Rongjun,

419
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
they'll be

420
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,340
surrounding Bianzhou.

421
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,820
How can Bianzhou stand by and watch?

422
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,580
That's why Chen Xiang

423
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,140
sent Lady Yulou as a mediator

424
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,420
to stop Wei

425
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,820
from building the canal in Rongjun.

426
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,580
Canal work is Wei's state affair.

427
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,340
Now that you are

428
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,900
the Lady of Bianzhou,

429
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,580
it's no longer appropriate

430
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,180
for us to discuss politics.

431
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,180
So, I can't accept

432
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,260
your grain.

433
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,980
Rongjun's drought

434
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,520
has drawn support from many prefectures.

435
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,180
Besides,

436
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,100
I can't betray

437
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,500
the Qiao-Wei alliance.

438
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,180
Yes.

439
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,260
I didn't consider it thoroughly.

440
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,620
I'll take my leave.

441
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,660
Zhonglin.

442
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,260
Wei Liang

443
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,300
humiliated me

444
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,060
with such a cheap gift.

445
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,420
Stop laughing.

446
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,620
My Lady,

447
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,340
Lady Yulou and the Lord

448
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,260
were almost betrothed.

449
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
So what?

450
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,060
So what? Well...

451
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,780
We just got rid of Zheng Shu,

452
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,580
and now Lady Yulou shows up.

453
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,660
How are you supposed to live in peace?

454
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,260
If I spend every day

455
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,780
dwelling on his old flings,

456
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,060
then life will truly become unlivable.

457
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,140
Anyway,

458
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,180
I heard that Lady Yulou

459
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,140
asked to see the Lord.

460
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,100
Who knows what it'll be like

461
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,380
when old lovers reunite?

462
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,140
After Bogong passed,

463
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,500
I married the Lord of Bianzhou.

464
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,300
Do you still resent me for it?

465
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,100
I was just a girl back then.

466
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,540
It wasn't what I wanted.

467
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,300
I was forced into it.

468
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,820
Let's not speak of the past anymore.

469
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Now,

470
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,580
I only wish you

471
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,260
endless good fortune.

472
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,740
My Lord.

473
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,460
My Lord.

474
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,540
Oh, you like this kind of thing?

475
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,280
Then

476
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,650
I'll take you to the streets later

477
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,960
and buy you more in other styles.

478
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,020
You're busy with affairs of state.

479
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,740
How could I trouble you
with my concerns?

480
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,180
Besides,

481
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,780
I've hated

482
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,820
flashy things like this

483
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
since I was a child.

484
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,180
Help the Lord change.

485
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,460
No need.

486
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,820
You may leave.

487
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

488
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,900
What happened?

489
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,620
The Lord of Wei rejected

490
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,340
free grain?

491
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,020
He's distancing himself from me

492
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,820
because I'm the Lady of Bianzhou.

493
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,020
The Qiao Clan of Yanzhou

494
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,580
sent wheat seeds to celebrate

495
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,820
(Qiao)
Lady Xu's birthday.

496
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,740
(Grain)

497
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,780
If the Lord of Wei is wary of you,

498
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,100
Ehuang,

499
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,580
how will you make your next move?

500
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
If I can't act freely,

501
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,100
then Lady Qiao,
as the daughter of his enemy,

502
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,420
is in an even worse position.

503
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,060
The Lord of Wei remembers the past

504
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,020
and holds grudges.

505
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,500
When my betrothal was on the table,

506
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,340
if the Qiao Clan
hadn't broken their word,

507
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,380
and if tragedy hadn't struck the Weis,

508
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,540
Bogong wouldn't have...

509
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,740
The Su Clan wouldn't have sent me
to Bianzhou.

510
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,900
I've never forgotten that grudge.

511
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,100
The Lord of Wei wouldn't forget either.

512
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,500
In that case,

513
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,140
Ehuang,

514
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,660
what should we do now?

515
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,100
The canal is for the seeds,

516
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,780
and the Lord of Wei rejected my grain

517
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,100
because of the seeds.

518
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,660
If something happens to the seeds...

519
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,580
Don't forget.

520
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,140
We still have one hidden piece to play.

521
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,780
(Granary, Qiao)

522
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,220
(Grain)

523
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Then I'll trouble you, Mr. Wei.

524
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,020
There's no need for such formality.

525
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,620
I should be the one

526
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,660
thanking Yanzhou for aiding Rongjun.

527
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,100
It's what we should do.

528
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,660
Mr. Wei, the wheat has been weighed.

529
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,620
Please take a look.

530
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,380
Make sure it's well-guarded.

531
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,220
Yes.

532
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,020
As expected of someone from Wei Mansion.

533
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,540
If she had better clothes,

534
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,300
her bearing and looks

535
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,020
would match any noble lady.

536
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,540
What a pity.

537
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,660
To help you, I must do this.

538
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,100
I didn't mean to offend you.

539
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,540
I'm new to Yujun

540
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,960
and not yet familiar with the area.

541
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,980
May I ask you

542
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,860
for directions?

543
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,900
Where do you want to go?

544
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,820
Do you know the way

545
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,660
to Wei Mansion?

546
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,100
Wei Mansion?

547
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,380
You're going to see the Lord of Wei?

548
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,220
Yes.

549
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,020
Who are you?

550
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,580
Ma'am,

551
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,500
this gentleman is

552
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,300
the young master
of the Su Clan from Wushan.

553
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,380
He came to offer birthday wishes

554
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,340
to Lady Xu.

555
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,020
Oh, you're a noble guest.

556
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,340
I'm Su Xin.

557
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,380
My style name is Zixin.

558
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,620
You look so lovely.

559
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,820
Which heartless husband

560
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,140
would let you

561
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
labor out here alone?

562
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,540
The route to the mansion isn't far,

563
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,820
but it is a bit tricky.

564
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,660
If you don't mind,

565
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,660
I'll go home and get changed

566
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,100
and then guide you there.

567
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,940
I would

568
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,980
love that.

569
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,340
Here.

570
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,580
Take this umbrella.

571
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,820
Thank you, sir.

572
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,860
Ehuang,

573
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,820
I've got her.

574
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,540
Chuyu was beaten by her in-laws?

575
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,860
Hurry and bring her here.

576
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,100
I need to ask about it.

577
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,100
But Lady Xu said

578
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,620
she wasn't allowed in the house.

579
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,980
Bring her to the outer courtyard.

580
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Just don't let Lady Xu find out.

581
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,180
You...

582
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm going now.

583
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,820
Where

584
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,260
is Mother going so early?

585
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,940
My Lady.

586
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,180
My Lady.

587
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,820
The guest list is ready.

588
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,020
No need to consult Lady Zhu.

589
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,860
My Lady.

590
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,120
Here are ritual records
of birthday banquets in Yujun,

591
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,880
family genealogy, guest list records,

592
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,300
and family gathering records.

593
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,620
They're all for your reference.

594
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,020
Thank you.

595
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,180
Can I take these back with me?

596
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,580
Of course.
But there's no need to carry them.

597
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,500
The Lord said you could use the study.

598
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,860
If you need any books or records,

599
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,940
just ask me.

600
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,380
The Lord prepared these?

601
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Yes.

602
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,460
(Guest List)

603
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,540
What does the Lord mean?

604
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,180
Maybe he's afraid I'll ruin the banquet

605
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,380
and embarrass him.

606
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,820
Or maybe he genuinely

607
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,580
cares about you.

608
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,260
Chuyu.

609
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,700
Let me look.

610
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,540
Aunt,

611
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,500
please save me.

612
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,980
Come on, get up.

613
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,420
What happened to your face?

614
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,740
Get up now.

615
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,900
They accused me of being indecent
with another man

616
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,580
but the truth is that gambler
squandered my dowry

617
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,940
and wanted more money from you.

618
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,420
Aunt,

619
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,460
the marriage Lady Xu arranged for me

620
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,220
has put me in great misery.

621
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,020
My life hasn't been easy either.

622
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,300
If it weren't for Lady Qiao,

623
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,980
you would've had everything you wanted.

624
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420
It looks like

625
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,100
to make this work,

626
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,260
we need Lady Qiao to slip up

627
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,100
so you can have the upper hand.

628
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,420
Mother supports her now.

629
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,820
What can I do?

630
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,660
There

631
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,780
might be a way,

632
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,260
but it depends on you.

633
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,180
(Granary)

634
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,100
Greetings, Mr. Wei.

635
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,940
Anything unusual in the granary today?

636
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,340
All is as usual.

637
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,460
Please rest assured.

638
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,780
(Granary)

639
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,400
Ehuang, it's done.

640
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,780
A grand birthday celebration

641
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,260
needs to be livelier.

642
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,220
I heard

643
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,900
Lady Yulou is gifted in music.

644
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,220
Would I

645
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,820
be lucky enough

646
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,740
to enjoy a performance today?

647
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,020
The Lord of Wei has heard me sing.

648
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,410
You may ask him.

649
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,860
Shiyuan,

650
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,820
Lady Yulou is noble now.

651
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,740
She's no longer someone

652
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,220
you can joke with like before.

653
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,180
I only hope

654
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,740
her singing can entertain you

655
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,100
on this special day.

656
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,780
How do you plan

657
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
to entertain me yourself?

658
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
Shiyuan,

659
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,020
why not perform a sword dance?

660
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,300
I can sing along.

661
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,220
What do you think?

662
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,740
That'll be wonderful.

663
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,020
It'll be great.

664
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,670
Sounds good.

How beautiful!

675
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,420
Beautiful!

676
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,100
Mr. Wei is truly charming.

677
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,960
You're hiding such talent.

678
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,390
If you were on the battlefield,

679
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,860
you'd be a mighty warrior for sure.

680
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,180
Indeed.

681
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,420
Your voice is like that of a goddess.

682
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,820
Thank you, Great-aunt.

683
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,100
Grandmother,

684
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,580
may you

685
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,640
live long with endless blessings

686
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
and everlasting health

687
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,340
and peace.

688
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,420
Mother, you must be
in high spirits today.

689
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,980
Shiyuan performed.

690
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,740
Lady Qiao gave a thoughtful gift.

691
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,700
I heard Yanzhou

692
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,300
also sent a generous gift.

693
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,820
Grandmother has seen it.

694
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,700
Yanzhou sent winter wheat seeds.

695
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,380
Just seeds?

696
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,940
Winter wheat is the foundation
of Yanzhou's prosperity.

697
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,900
Giving this

698
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,330
shows great sincerity.

699
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,210
It's the best birthday gift
I could receive.

700
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,940
It's just winter wheat.

701
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,480
Is it really that special?

702
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,460
You didn't seem interested

703
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,500
in this before.

704
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,220
Zhonglin, what are you doing?

705
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,580
I...

706
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,100
Want to use the restroom?

707
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,260
Go on then.

708
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
This child...

709
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,900
Mother, I mean no offense.

710
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
I'm just curious.

711
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,740
Since we're all here,

712
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,700
why not have Lady Qiao

713
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
bring out the seeds

714
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,580
for everyone to see?

715
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,420
Right?

716
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,020
- Yes.
- Great.

717
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,780
Let's see them.

718
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,460
We want to see
what winter wheat is like.

719
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,180
Grandmother.

720
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,020
Mother.

721
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,260
These are the wheat seeds from Yanzhou.

722
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,220
Please have a look.

723
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,830
This winter wheat

724
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,180
is an improved strain.

725
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,720
It's planted in the autumn equinox

726
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,000
and harvested in the fifth month

727
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,260
of the next year.

728
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,020
It's perfect for easing food shortages
in early summer.

729
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,700
But winter wheat

730
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,260
has always been exclusive to Yanzhou.

731
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,180
Yanzhou produces and sells them,

732
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,740
but it never gives away seeds.

733
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,340
This time,

734
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,220
on Grandmother's birthday,

735
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,460
Yanzhou shares them

736
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,980
in hopes

737
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,580
of standing together with Wei

738
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,900
through thick and thin.

739
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,260
What's that smell?

740
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,580
Could it

741
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,940
be mold?

742
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,700
Yes.

743
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,660
How dare you!

744
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,420
I want to ask you today.

745
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,060
What exactly is your family up to?

746
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,460
Fourteen years ago,

747
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,660
you broke your word

748
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,020
on the battlefield

749
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,620
and caused enough misery to our family.

750
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,060
How dare you present

751
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,540
these rotten seeds as a gift?

752
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,620
Take them away!

753
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,300
Mother,

754
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,100
I personally inspected

755
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,980
these seeds.

756
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,700
Every single one was carefully selected.

757
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,620
This concerns an alliance
between our families

758
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,420
and the lives of our people.

759
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,310
The Qiao Clan would never

760
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,060
treat it lightly.

761
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,900
From what I see,

762
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,700
each grain is full and intact.

763
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,100
They're not rotten.

764
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,860
Though the seeds

765
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,140
aren't rotten,

766
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,180
they're floating.

767
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,330
They're cooked!

768
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,540
Cooked!

769
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,900
They're cooked!

770
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,060
How could they be cooked?

771
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,300
They're truly cooked.

772
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,340
Cooked seeds.

773
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,020
How can cooked seeds be planted?

774
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,300
Let me see.

775
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,580
It's hard to tell if they're raw seeds.

776
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,540
If the people plant them

777
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,130
and they don't sprout,

778
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,630
they'll blame themselves

779
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,120
for not tending the fields properly.

780
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,060
Then they'll miss the planting season,

781
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,620
and the famine will be even worse
than this year.

782
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,500
People live on food.

783
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,660
Everyone, they must hate us deeply.

784
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,660
Exactly.

785
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,060
What were they thinking?

786
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,950
The seeds that won't grow.

787
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
What a malicious scheme.

788
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,620
It looks like Yanzhou's seeds are here

789
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,580
to cause havoc.

790
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,120
We demand an explanation today.

791
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,070
What's going on?

792
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,620
The seeds are the foundation of a state.

793
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,520
We need an explanation.

794
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,280
Everyone says
Yanzhou's seeds are the best.

795
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,300
If they send us duds,

796
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,940
the farmers will suffer.

797
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,060
If the seeds are steamed and dried,

798
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,820
it'll be hard to tell if they're cooked

799
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,660
without careful examination.

800
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,350
We can test them

801
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,000
to find out.

802
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,860
Look. Some are floating.

803
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,820
Look, look.

804
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,420
They're cooked.

805
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,660
That's right.

806
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,700
They're all cooked.

807
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,580
The seeds are all cooked.

808
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,020
That can't be.

809
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,100
My Lady,

810
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,300
I swear I didn't know.

811
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,780
Grandmother.

812
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,420
Everyone.

813
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,180
My uncle may be foolish,

814
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,940
but this is serious.

815
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,020
He would never risk

816
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,340
the lives of Wei's people.

817
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,060
There must be a misunderstanding.

818
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,060
A misunderstanding?

819
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,020
Good thing there's no war now.

820
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,700
Grain is extremely important in wars.

821
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,380
How would we feed the soldiers

822
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,780
and the people without grain?

823
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,740
The Qiao Clan

824
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,300
- is so vile.
- Indeed.

825
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,630
There will be famine every year.

826
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,660
My Lady, what should we do?

827
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,340
Shall I go beg the Lord?

828
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,160
He might not help us.

829
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,790
It's a plot against our people.

830
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,940
We must get to the bottom of this today.

831
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
We demand an explanation.

832
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,220
We need an answer.

833
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,900
The Lady has always been cautious here

834
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,900
just like me.

835
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,180
How can you gang up on a woman?

836
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,980
How can a lady of inner chambers

837
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,900
get involved

838
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,500
in political affairs?

839
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,460
In my opinion,

840
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,940
it was Qiao Yue who did this.

841
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,220
Grandmother,

842
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,100
perhaps someone plotted to frame us.

843
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,540
Please look into it fairly.

844
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,060
Look into it?

845
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,500
The truth is right before us.
Stop trying to deny it.

846
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
They might not be seeds from Yanzhou.

847
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,300
They're definitely from Yanzhou.

848
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,140
- Stop denying it.
- Exactly.

849
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
Yanzhou's envoy presented them.

850
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,420
They must be from Yanzhou.

851
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,580
How wicked.

852
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,860
You try to use steamed seeds
to fool the people.

853
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,220
What are you up to?

854
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,800
This is Grandmother's birthday banquet,

855
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,820
not a place for shouting.

856
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,620
Silence!

857
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,500
Shao, they're all cooked.

858
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I already know.

859
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,060
In that case,

860
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,540
punish the Lady now.

861
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,380
At Grandmother's birthday banquet,

862
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,240
what a surprise to see a mystery

863
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,100
instead of a puppet show.

864
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,500
Clearly,

865
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,100
someone wanted to disgrace our family.

866
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,380
What mystery?

867
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,820
Lady Qiao clearly plotted this.

868
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,900
With bad seeds,

869
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,820
she wants our people to starve.

870
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,380
She ignores the people's suffering.

871
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,700
She's pure evil.

872
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,860
Why are you laughing?

873
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm laughing

874
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,180
because I'd believe you

875
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,340
if you told me Lady Qiao wanted
to poison my whole family,

876
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,980
but I'd never believe

877
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,500
she'd harm the people.

878
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,620
Get up.

879
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,020
Grandmother,

880
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,860
back in Xindu,

881
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,340
Lady Qiao risked her reputation

882
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,860
to help me win back the people's trust.

883
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
The people of Xindu

884
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,380
volunteered for labor.

885
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,020
Then in Panyi,

886
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,060
she risked her life

887
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,700
to fight off the Liangya army

888
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,300
with me.

889
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,500
Afterward,

890
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,820
using her identity as a Qiao,

891
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,620
she persuaded local experts
to help repair the canal.

892
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,820
The Yongning Canal

893
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,700
revived after 14 years

894
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,820
because of her.

895
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,620
All of you here

896
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,820
drink from your cups

897
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,380
yet forget who made it possible.

she doesn't need to go this far.

901
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,220
She just needs to refuse to help me
with the canal.

902
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,380
So,

903
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,300
this must be a setup.

Before entering Yujun,

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,300
the seeds must've been weighed.

910
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,300
Dried seeds

911
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,460
are lighter than the raw ones.

912
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,140
So if there was a switch,

913
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,620
we'd know by weighing.

- Yes!

916
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,420
Weigh the seeds.

917
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,700
The Lady and the Lord are of one heart.

918
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,300
She wouldn't betray him.

919
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,540
If the seeds weren't tampered with
before storage,

920
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,820
then the problem lies after.

921
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,620
May I ask

922
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,540
who manages the granary?

923
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
Could it be

924
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,700
someone else is plotting

925
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,540
against the Lord?

926
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,140
According to Lady Yulou,

927
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,420
if it wasn't

928
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,060
Lady Qiao,

929
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,460
then it must be Wei Yan.

930
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,020
How interesting.

931
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,820
My Lord.

932
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,240
Should we continue weighing?

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,740
Shao,

934
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,460
if neither Lady Qiao

935
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,940
nor Wei Yan is behind this,

936
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,140
you owe us

937
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,620
an explanation.

938
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,180
- Exactly.
- Yes.

939
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,900

How can our people be treated this way?

941
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,380
My Lord,

00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,700
one is your wife,

943
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,450
and the other is your cousin.

944

Who will you choose?

945
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,340
Mr. Wei is just the Lord's cousin,

946
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,140
not his real brother.

947
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,940
