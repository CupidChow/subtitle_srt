1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is love the only thing that can last me for the rest of my life?

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel more and more pained?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are my ordinary care

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will fall again

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you are not the wind in my arms

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will go through the mist and run through the wind

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will go through the mist and run through the wind

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Give me love, give me light

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will be your hero

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 2

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What? Are you going to take the position of the leader?

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The position of the leader

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Young Master is talented

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We will listen to you in the future

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Young Master

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Good

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Greetings, Young Master

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are indeed the son of Chen Pang

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Since the general is convinced of you

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The position of the leader of Shi Yuan is very good

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the future

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am not a young master

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am the eldest of the Weis

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want to be a whip

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are a traitor

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Traitor?

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I just want to ask you

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My mother was your comrade-in-arms

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My mother was your comrade-in-arms

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Shut up

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Since you don't want to be the young master

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then go to the border

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Come back when you think it over

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Young Master

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Master

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's hard to go to the border

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There are many troubles in the border

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why do you have to be so modest?

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I know the difficulties of the border

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But the Wei family

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Make a dog into a dog

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Crush his will

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Erase his murderous spirit

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have to practice his murderous spirit

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In the future

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Can become the leader of the border

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The master's whole heart

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Touched the lungs

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Overcome its destruction

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Master

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Obviously it's Pan Yi

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There are 100000 people in Liuyan

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Attacks Pan Yi

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We have only 30K

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Now there are only 30,000.

60
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,920
It's a total of 30,000.

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,080
The gap between the two sides is also very large.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,640
Don't worry.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,080
The female army promised

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,400
not to bring the Boya reinforcements.

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,720
The female army promised.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,080
But I don't know the Qiao family.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,280
Will they be like 15 years ago?

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
They are very cunning.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Lu He.

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Lu He.

71
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,000
Stop.

72
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,360
Your Highness.

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,120
There is a report.

74
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
Wei Shao has brought 30,000 soldiers

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
to support Pan Yi.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,720
They will arrive at the battlefield tomorrow.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,840
Leave.

78
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,640
Yes.

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Only 30,000?

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,040
Wei Shao and the Qiao family are really close.

81
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
They are willing to die to protect the Qiao family.

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,920
Your Highness.

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,360
Pan Yi City is hard to attack.

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,160
Now our army has lost 20,000 soldiers.

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Now

86
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,560
the bandits will attack from behind.

87
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you think?

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,160
Don't panic.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,840
We have 20,000 soldiers on the way.

90
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,040
This time

91
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,280
I will not let Pan Yi

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,760
get away.

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,120
Man Man brought so many people on this trip.

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,600
And the general escorted them.

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,040
It can be seen that Marquis Wei is very good to the female army.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I heard that even the people of Wei

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,080
are honored by the female army.

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,880
Man Man.

99
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Sister Zhang.

100
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,000
Slow down.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
Be careful.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Slow down.

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Be careful.

104
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
You are so big.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,000
Let me see.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,000
You are thin.

107
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,880
You are fat.

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,480
Look at you. You are so big.

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
You always make me happy.

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Why didn't you tell me in advance that

111
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
I would let someone pick you up outside the city?

112
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
You came in a hurry and forgot.

113
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,480
Where is brother-in-law?

114
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
He is not in the mansion.

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,640
He went to the border to look for a house.

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Let's go.

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,320
Let's go back and talk slowly.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,760
Come on.

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Your favorite Lan Xiang wine and spicy lamb.

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,240
I asked someone to make it.

121
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,040
Try it.

122
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,320
Is it the same taste as before?

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,160
Sister Zhang.

124
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,240
Why is brother-in-law not back yet?

125
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,040
He used to go out for three or five days.

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
It's a long time.

127
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
He should be back soon.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
You can rest assured.

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,040
If you need anything, just tell me.

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,480
I came here

131
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
not just to talk about the marriage.

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,120
Do you know

133
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
Lian Chang and Yanzhou were surrounded?

134
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
I heard from the brush.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
Lan Jun sent me to take the troops.

136
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,440
It should be the last day of the year.

137
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm sure

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,840
the Marquis of Wei will be victorious.

139
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,480
It's different this time.

140
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Liu Yan took 100,000 soldiers.

141
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,760
In order to save Lian Chang,

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,280
the South Army only took 30,000 soldiers to the rebellion.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Although the rebellion has 30,000 soldiers,

144
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,560
the strength is still too much.

145
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,160
Manman.

146
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,680
We are just a female army.

147
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
We can't be together.

148
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
What can we do?

149
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
We can only pray to God

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,720
to protect Wei and Yanzhou.

151
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,080
If the prayer is useful,

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,560
how can the three generations of the Wei family

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
die in Xin Du?

154
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,160
Manman.

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,960
You were right.

156
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,360
Your brother-in-law

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
is indeed

158
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,200
a person who can entrust his life to you.

159
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,400
I thought we were both lost.

160
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
He was a fool.

161
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
He was afraid of me

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
and stayed at the door of the house all night.

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,640
Sometimes, he went to the dock

164
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
to work hard

165
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
to make me a meal.

166
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
He always wanted to find a way

167
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,160
to give me the best.

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
That's why.

169
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
No matter how hard I lived,

170
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,600
I never had a good memory.

171
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,480
I don't know when it is.

172
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
Why are you telling me this?

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
When will my brother-in-law come back?

174
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,440
But now we are in the Boya.

175
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,840
I can't be tired.

176
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,040
Xue Tai and all the people

177
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,940
from the Liuminous and the Fat-Heads

178
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
harassed me every three times.

179
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
In order not to make me worried,

180
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,440
he didn't tell me that he was injured.

181
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
One more time,

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,920
in order to pick up the sour plum,

183
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
I walked to the border of the borderland

184
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,120
and was forced to fight

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,920
after being found by Xue Tai.

186
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
For five days.

187
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,600
He didn't come back.

188
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,040
If he has a third-rate,

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,000
I really don't know

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
how I should live.

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,000
But...

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
I understand.

193
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,920
The friendship between sister and brother-in-law

194
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
is very impressive.

195
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,240
But I and Nan Jun

196
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,720
are not like that.

197
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,600
But the Liuyan

198
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
is not only for the Wei State

199
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,640
but also for the Yan State.

200
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Do you remember?

201
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,040
When we were young, my grandfather

202
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
took us to the city of Lian to build the river.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
How did the people there

204
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
support and love us?

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Nan Jun is now in a difficult situation

206
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
and is in a difficult situation.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Are you going to do nothing?

208
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,720
It's not that I don't want to help you.

209
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,080
It's just that the health of Boya is limited.

210
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,440
I really can't help you.

211
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
There are 20,000 bullies in Boya.

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,320
It's enough to turn the situation around.

213
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
If Liuyan is in a big trouble,

214
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
how can he be more confident

215
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,720
than Zhine?

216
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,920
You know that the front is dangerous.

217
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Do you want him to die?

218
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
I don't want him to die.

219
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,480
At least,

220
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,120
I just got the military report.

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520
There are still 20,000 reinforcements on the way.

222
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
It will arrive in Wuze in three days.

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,760
It will arrive in Banye in five days.

224
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,880
When his reinforcements arrive,

225
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
Nan Jun and the people of Banye

226
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
will be in a difficult situation.

227
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,640
Man Man.

228
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
You are talented and responsible.

229
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,440
You can save the people of the world.

230
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
But I'm really different.

231
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm just a woman

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,520
who has no vision and no ambition.

233
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,320
I use all my strength

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,520
to protect one person.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm not like you.

236
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,960
You can do anything for the Qiao family

237
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
and the people of Yan State.

238
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
You can let your husband

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,520
go to the hell for you.

240
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,360
But I can't do it.

241
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,720
I want to find a way

242
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,280
to let my Nan Jun

243
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,240
go to hell for me.

244
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,120
That's why Iured Yubing

245
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,080
lost some money.

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,440
Taoism tuck?

247
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,320
I could also apply it.

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,600
That's why you think I'm wrong too.

249
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,440
You are not wrong.

250
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,880
I didn't have you,

251
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,120
why couldn't you just help me?

252
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
I can't let Pi Chi die for you.

253
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I can't be evil with love.

254
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Let him protect my family.

255
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Even if it's you,

256
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
even if you regret it,

257
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
hate me.

258
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I will never regret.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I...

260
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
So you're very happy

261
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
and don't care about this anymore.

262
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
General Yi Zhi.

263
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Li Jun.

264
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
I'm looking for the road.

265
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I saw the movement of the road.

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
I heard that the female army came.

267
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
I rushed back.

268
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Fan.

269
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
What's wrong with you?

270
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
I don't want to be with Zhang Qian.

271
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I don't want to be with my sister.

272
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
But since I was a child,

273
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
she has been living and dying as a sister.

274
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Now I see you and your brother-in-law

275
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
are in love.

276
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
You live your own life.

277
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm really happy for you.

278
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Don't worry.

279
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I don't care about you.

280
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
But my husband is still fighting in the front line.

282
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Although there is no difficulty in fighting against the enemy,

283
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I can't be patient.

284
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
I'll go first.

285
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Take care of yourself.

286
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Li Jun.

287
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
What's wrong with you?

288
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Zhang Qian knows that I'm going to die.

289
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I can't hold it in anymore.

290
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm going to let him live.

291
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
What am I doing?

292
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Li Jun.

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
It's not your fault.

294
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Don't cry.

295
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
It's hard to attack the enemy.

296
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Liu Yan didn't get it until today.

297
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
It means that he has lost many soldiers.

298
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Tomorrow,

299
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
we will attack the enemy in front and back.

300
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
We can fight quickly.

301
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
We can catch the chance before Liu Yan's reinforcements come.

302
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
All right.

303
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
It's hard for you to go on a trip.

304
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Have a rest early.

305
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Yes.

306
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Yuchun,

307
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Our men told them

308
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
what to do if someoneเขe' isn't there.

309
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,680
didn't allow such a thing RSW

310
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
In ticket

311
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,840
If I die

312
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,000
But my brother

313
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:56,500
will fight back

314
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,580
Killing him

315
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,960
My son

316
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
Don't get mad

317
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,880
Companions

318
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,720
My son

319
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,040
cold

320
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,080
Either this

321
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,280
my life

322
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,200
Will you begin to

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,680
stop

324
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Don't worry.

325
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,080
Yujuan,

326
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
I didn't mean that.

327
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,160
How could we leave you?

328
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
I know you won't leave me.

329
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,320
But this is

330
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,000
the agreement between me and Nanjun.

331
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
I won't let him

332
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,200
and Jiangshan be separated.

333
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,920
So I must go.

334
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,680
Even if it's to die.

335
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,560
But I can't let you

336
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,080
die with me.

337
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,040
But...

338
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,920
Alright.

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,840
Here. Here.

340
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll make a shelter.

341
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,600
As long as it's blocked by mud,

342
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,760
ants can get through.

343
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,120
As long as I dig the mud,

344
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,640
ants will be drowned.

345
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
You're so annoying.

346
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,920
Ants are drowned by you.

347
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,280
Why are you so annoying?

348
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,880
I'm scared.

349
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,520
Chunniang.

350
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
Where's the mud I dug?

351
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,680
I'll get it.

352
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,760
Yujuan, I found it.

353
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,600
Nanjun and Liu Yan

354
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
are fighting in the wild mine outside Panyi City.

355
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,360
Liu Yan wants to surround the city.

356
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,800
So he's going to go around the city

357
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,640
and guard the house.

358
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,680
I promised to guard the back for Nanjun.

359
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,560
I won't let a single soldier

360
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
get through the house.

361
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,600
What's your plan?

362
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,600
The water is high.

363
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,080
The water is high.

364
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,360
The water is high.

365
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,320
The bottom is high.

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,320
The bottom is flat.

367
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,800
If the bottom is curved, it will flow back.

368
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,560
If the bottom is flat, it will flow forward.

369
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,640
The bottom is flat.

370
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,080
The bottom is high.

371
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,720
If the bottom is curved, it will flow backward.

372
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,360
It means

373
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
if the water is low,

374
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
as long as the water is high

375
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,600
and strong,

376
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
it can float and move.

377
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
Although I'm not good enough,

378
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,400
I can't fight them.

379
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,920
But as long as I use the terrain well,

380
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
I may be able to win.

381
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,400
How?

382
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,520
The chief said

383
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
if you want to lower the water level,

384
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,560
you can block the top

385
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,320
or the bottom.

386
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,440
If there's really a top,

387
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,480
the top of the house is oxygen.

388
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,200
We'll build a dam at the junction

389
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,360
to block the oxygen.

390
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,280
The surface of the house will naturally drop.

391
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,360
When we destroy the dam,

392
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,560
the water will flow out of the oxygen

393
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,560
and form a dead end.

394
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,440
Then Liang Anjun will be like ants.

395
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,960
As long as we move around,

396
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,080
they will lose.

397
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,960
In this way,

398
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,040
no matter it's Liang Anjun or Shi Wanjun,

399
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
they will all die.

400
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,400
Let's go to the upstream to get water.

401
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,440
How long will it take to build the sand?

402
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,160
Half a month.

403
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,000
A few days less.

404
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,760
It's too late, Anjun.

405
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,160
It's too late.

406
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
Water

407
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,920
should be changed according to water.

408
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,760
It should be moved and guided.

409
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,600
It's like the principle of doing things.

410
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,400
It should be changed

411
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,920
and be in the right place.

412
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
This is also a kind of wisdom.

413
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
We don't go upstream.

414
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,520
We go downstream.

415
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
I remember my grandfather

416
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,640
left a reservoir here.

417
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,600
We put the water in the reservoir

418
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,400
and lowered the water level.

419
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,080
We lied to them.

420
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
The female army didn't want to be in trouble.

421
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,360
They didn't want to fight with them.

422
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,760
There's no other way.

423
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,000
I have no other way.

424
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,000
My husband,

425
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,360
please don't wait for me.

426
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,760
The Qiao family didn't recover from the injustice 15 years ago.

427
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,880
But this year,

428
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
I will never betray my promise

429
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,880
and let you be alone.

430
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,560
If the leaves and the wind are like ice,

431
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,680
I will be your night sea.

432
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,440
Oneista in the mosquito intelligent

433
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:48,160
Emperor got the

434
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,120
outside of powder

435
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
Shotes the

436
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,140
snow

437
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,200
non-stop

438
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
to move

439
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,360
way

440
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
to

441
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I've been through countless hardships

442
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
I'll go with you

443
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
I'm willing to go with you

444
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Wei Shao has only 30,000 people

445
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,360
and we have 20,000 soldiers on the way

446
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,360
The leader of the bandits, General Wei Qi

447
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Good

448
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Go

449
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Go

450
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
Go

451
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Go

452
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Soldiers

453
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,360
20 miles from the dead

454
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
we're in the wild

455
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,360
The soldiers are fighting for blood

456
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,360
We're fighting for the front

457
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
If it goes well

458
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,360
we can turn the situation around

459
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,360
You're all the soldiers of the Wei family

460
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
and the elite soldiers of the Wei family

461
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
But now

462
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,360
I can only ignore everyone's safety

463
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
and drag everyone to a battle with me

464
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Yes, General

465
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
General, listen

466
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
The first and second lines

467
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
go to the Wuzhe River

468
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,360
The first line goes not only to the soil

469
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
but also to the Wuzhe River

470
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
The second line will capture the birds

471
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
and take the reinforcements of the Liang'an Army

472
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
to the Wuzhe River

473
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
There are also a lot of soldiers and horses

474
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
The people of the Wuzhe River will stay here

475
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
and not only to the Wuzhe River

476
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
but also to the Wuzhe River

477
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
Yes

478
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
The first line, follow me

479
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
The second line, follow me

480
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Report

481
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Master

482
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Liu Shan, the deputy general of Liangya

483
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
led the five thousand iron flags to attack from the left

484
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
and broke into our cavalry

485
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Send my order

486
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
to prepare for the attack

487
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Yes

488
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Report, Master

489
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Report

490
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
The Liang'an Army is very strong

491
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
The front of the Wu Army is very strong

492
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Tell the iron cavalry to wait

493
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
and the whole army to retreat

494
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Yes

495
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Report

496
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Report

497
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Han Yicheng sent an urgent report

498
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
The new army is weak

499
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Please give us more reinforcements

500
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,360
It is estimated that the female army

501
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
should have invited the reinforcements

502
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,360
to break through the Boya and Wuzhe River

503
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I believe she will come

504
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Be careful

505
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Wu Xun, although the manpower is limited

506
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
you don't have to go to the battlefield yourself

507
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I feel so bad

508
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
It's okay

509
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Let me do it

510
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
No, Chen Yan, take the firewood

511
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Go, go, go

512
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Yes

513
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Go

514
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Breaking Bad

515
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,460
Start balls

516
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Lady

517
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Liangya's reinforcements can travel to the Wuz divorce tomorrow

518
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Okay

519
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,040
The female troops

520
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,360
are ready

521
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
Fire!

522
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
Fire!

523
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Fire!

524
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
After one night in the water,

525
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
this water tank will be full.

526
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Clean it up quickly.

527
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
We'll go to the toilet.

528
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Okay.

529
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Fire!

530
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Tomorrow,

531
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
we'll attack from three directions.

532
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Wei Xue,

533
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
follow me.

534
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Attack from the front.

535
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Use the Yulin Formation to arrange the troops.

536
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Yes.

537
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Deputy Commander,

538
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
the Wuzi River is at the water level.

539
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
It's going to be flooded.

540
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Why is that?

541
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
I haven't found out yet.

542
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Is Liang Ya Jun doing this on purpose

543
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
to cross the river?

544
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
If they want to cross the river,

545
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
they must retreat

546
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
before the reinforcements arrive.

547
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
Follow my order.

548
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Attack at the right time tomorrow.

549
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Yes.

550
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Fan,

551
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
I'm back.

552
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Fan,

553
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Fan, what's wrong?

554
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Did the fetus in your womb make trouble?

555
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
No.

556
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I just thought of Man Man.

557
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
When the female army left,

558
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
the Wei Army escorted them.

559
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
You don't have to worry.

560
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
After a few days,

561
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
she should have returned to the army.

562
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Pan Yi is fighting now.

563
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,360
When the female army left,

564
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
she told me to guard the Bo Ya.

565
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Otherwise,

566
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
I would have sent her back for you.

567
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Listen up,

568
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
the people of Han Yi City,

569
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
whether they are from Yan State

570
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
or from the Wei State,

571
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
the people of Han Yi

572
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
should not suffer

573
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
the disaster of the past.

574
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Since we are here,

575
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
we must protect Pan Yi.

576
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
This battle

577
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
is only allowed to win.

578
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
It's not allowed to lose.

579
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,360
It's a bloody battle.

580
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Yes.

581
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
It's a bloody battle.

582
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
It's a bloody battle.

583
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
It's a bloody battle.

584
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
It's a bloody battle.

585
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
A bloody battle!

586
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
A bloody battle!

587
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
A bloody battle!

588
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
A bloody battle!

589
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
A bloody battle!

590
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Let's go.

591
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,280
Those idiots are immediately obsessed with ranked positions,

592
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,000
as simple as X全部,

593
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,920
persons whose rank they'll never quarterly surpass

594
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,440
will like these riddles.

595
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,520
A place like that

596
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,600
like Business School,

597
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,880
like Maintain's exam.

598
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,920
But you like a child practiced by a young r referenceser,

599
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,340
president strengths him with

600
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,320
confidence,

601
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,280
but oke for skills

602
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,640
makes him a foundation of the whole sect.

603
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
It's the daughter of Marquis Wei, Qiao Nu.

604
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,480
The daughter of Marquis Wei.

605
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,360
She's alone?

606
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,520
If we can capture her,

607
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,680
it'll be a great achievement.

608
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,200
Guards!

609
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,720
Yes!

610
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,440
Prepare to move the river.

611
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,360
Arrest Qiao Nu!

612
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,720
Kill the bandits!

613
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,560
Go!

614
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
smartphone, blow around!

615
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,120
Fight hard

616
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
My late servant

617
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Don't be afraid of the stormy spring

618
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,040
Keep the yearning in your heart

619
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,440
The blood is flowing

620
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,040
Don't run if you are a thief

621
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,840
Or you will die

622
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,640
The blood is flowing

623
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Report

624
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
How is it?

625
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Your Highness

626
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,640
Half of our soldiers have been injured

627
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Useless

628
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Your Highness

629
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
You are here just in time

630
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
But the reinforcements are here

631
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Your Highness

632
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,040
They can't make it

633
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
General Lin's words

634
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,440
are to destroy the enemy

635
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
We can only retreat

636
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
What?

637
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Your Highness

638
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Our soldiers are attacking

639
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640
and killing

640
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,840
We can't hold on

641
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Retreat

642
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Your Highness

643
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Retreat

644
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Your Highness

645
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Go

646
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Back to Liangya

647
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,240
Go

648
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,640
Back to Liangya

649
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
Keep up the pursuit

650
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,040
Keep up the pursuit

651
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Congratulations to the Duke of the Central Palace

652
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,640
The soldiers are safe

653
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Your Highness

654
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,640
It's not easy to win this battle

655
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,240
So many soldiers have been separated

656
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,640
They are going to Liancheng and Xiao Gang

657
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,240
Only a small part of the troops are left to deal with Liu Yan

658
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,240
It's really difficult

659
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,840
It's really not easy

660
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,840
Search the battlefield

661
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Yes

662
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
Your Highness

663
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,840
Fortunately, the female army didn't break their promise

664
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,040
We invited the Bo Ya to help you

665
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,440
We were able to hold on

666
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,240
We defeated 20,000 reinforcements in Liangya

667
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
and won the battle for you

668
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,840
It's indeed a good opportunity

669
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640
But

670
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,040
it's just to protect the good situation in Yan

671
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Your Highness

672
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,440
The Bo Ya reinforcements are a little late

673
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
but they also played a role

674
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,840
The female army must be worried about you

675
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,640
What are you worried about?

676
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
I've been out of the battle for so long

677
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,040
I don't have any family

678
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
I don't know

679
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,240
I thought the cloud army was so busy

680
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,640
We don't have time for that

681
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,240
I'll go back and settle the score with you

682
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,040
Tell the brothers to rest first

683
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,640
We'll go to support Liancheng later

684
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,240
Yes

685
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,040
Your Highness, he's taking out the water lanterns over there

686
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
No wonder

687
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,840
The battle has turned so suddenly

688
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,040
The female army must have invited the Bo Ya reinforcements in person

689
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,640
I'll go and pick him up

690
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Your Highness

691
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,040
Your Highness

692
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
Your Highness

693
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Your Highness

694
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,040
We've recovered Liancheng and Xiu Gang

695
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,440
We're here to meet

696
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,640
Thanks to my brother-in-law

697
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
We stopped the Liu Yan reinforcements

698
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,840
and let General Wei Liang

699
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
bring most of the troops to Liancheng

700
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
We were able to make it so smoothly

701
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,040
Thank you very much

702
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,840
You should thank your sister

703
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,240
it's totally optional

704
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
Liancheng

705
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
Do you believe in me?

706
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,240
Believe in you

707
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,440
Come

708
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I don't believe in these

709
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
The End

710
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Master, don't worry

711
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,120
After the soldiers are done

712
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
I'll go with you to pick up the female soldiers

713
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,920
Who said I'm a female soldier?

714
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm thinking

715
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,880
is there any other candidates?

716
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,960
There won't be

717
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,760
Liu Yan will be defeated in this battle

718
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,840
This battle can be more or less

719
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,040
One of them is to be brave

720
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,200
and lead the troops

721
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
The second one

722
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
The female soldiers are also unbeatable

723
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,360
They defeated the reinforcements from Wuzhe to Pan Yi

724
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,120
and cut off Liu Yan's rear

725
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,640
Otherwise, this battle

726
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,360
is more than death

727
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,400
At this point

728
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,920
I'm not inferior to the military master

729
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
Of course

730
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,960
My sister is the smartest

731
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
What's smart?

732
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,960
Just that little smart

733
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Xiao Tao sent a message to me

734
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
and asked me to go to Liancheng

735
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,240
She said that my sister went to Bo Ya personally

736
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,480
to invite the reinforcements for my brother-in-law

737
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,480
I thought she was trying to fool me

738
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
My sister and brother-in-law are really...

739
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,800
Xiao Tao especially invited

740
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,320
the little boy as a reinforcement for me

741
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,480
The female soldier is more affectionate

742
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,280
She went to the battlefield herself

743
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,640
to help the male soldiers

744
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
Although the reinforcements from Bo Ya

745
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,120
came late

746
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,080
But there must be a reason for it

747
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,040
What friendship?

748
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,080
She just misses her Yanzhou
