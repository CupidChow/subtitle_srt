1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and your kindness

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and your kindness

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget your kindness

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and your kindness

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and your kindness

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your kindness

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your kindness

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and your kindness

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and your kindness

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and your kindness

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and your kindness

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and your kindness

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and your kindness

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and your kindness

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and your kindness

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your kindness

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and your kindness

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and your kindness

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Grandfather, father, elder brother

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is my wife, Qiao Shi

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Long Ballad

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Everyone, 15 years ago

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we had a great disaster

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We were so sorry

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that we couldn't take it anymore

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But today we can finally get through it

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and see our father come back

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I am not the only one

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
who suffers

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Our grandmothers

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and mothers

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
are so kind

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Your support

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and help

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is what brought this day

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will give you a toast

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,880
Besides,

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,520
I have to thank someone else.

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
From now on,

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,160
we'll only look ahead,

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
and never ask where we're going.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,800
We'll share the same happiness and sorrow,

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,280
and share the same pain.

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,600
The hatred is like a mountain.

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800
If you keep it in your heart,

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,960
it's hard to move forward.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,240
Zhong Lin,

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,920
it's good that you can get rid of this mountain.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,720
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,760
Madam,

63
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,080
the man is here.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,520
Mom.

65
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,520
What's up?

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
Zhong Lin,

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,560
I've always had an idea

68
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,120
about you and your son-in-law.

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,320
I'll talk to you about it today.

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,520
I thought it was something important.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm busy with my work.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
We'll talk later.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,160
You don't have to say anything.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
I know you two are in love now.

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,320
But

76
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,680
how can you let him give up on you?

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
We've talked about Qiao Shi more than once.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,480
I have my own decision.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
You can't.

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,560
I...

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,280
If you don't want to have a long-term marriage,

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,440
you two

83
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,200
have to have a child.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,360
So,

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,240
I've already discussed it with him.

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
What's the use of discussing it?

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,080
The relatives think that

88
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,480
as long as you two are in love,

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,520
you can have a long-lasting child.

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't think it's okay.

91
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,880
Why not?

92
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
Tell me.

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
Because of the contract,

94
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,560
you two

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,240
haven't slept together for a year, right?

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,880
I...

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
Where did you get the contract?

98
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,320
I have an idea.

99
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,960
No, you have an idea.

100
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
We're in a contract because of the contract.

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,800
So we...

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
No, don't bother.

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,080
Look.

104
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,640
Well,

105
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,400
we've already...

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,400
No.

107
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,880
No.

108
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,840
The child-rearing ceremony is all by God's will.

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,280
Why?

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
It's all because of the human nature.

111
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,880
I asked you for this.

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,000
What...

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
What is it?

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,280
I heard that

115
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,560
as long as the bride

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920
wears the clothes or accessories

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
that are suitable for pregnant women

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,440
in the next few months,

119
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,120
she can be happy.

120
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
She'll be pregnant soon.

121
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
You even believe this?

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
I think my daughter-in-law

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
is interested in the child-rearing ceremony.

124
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,720
I've asked her about it.

125
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,760
This is a good-luck family.

126
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,920
It's a good-luck family.

127
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,120
It's a little bit bloody.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
But it's okay.

129
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
Take it back.

130
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Put it under the bed.

131
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,480
Don't make a noise.

132
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,400
It's a good-luck family.

133
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,840
Can it work?

134
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Of course it can.

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
In a blink of an eye,

136
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
the Lord and the Queen

137
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
have been married for more than a year.

138
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,720
That's right.

139
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,040
It's been more than a year

140
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
since we met outside the city.

141
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,040
Again?

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
Do you have to say it every year?

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
Besides, I've already

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
asked the Lord for a favor.

145
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,960
You said it.

146
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Whoever pleads for you

147
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,240
will be your slave.

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,160
I'll be your slave.

149
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Come on.

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
You don't have to.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
Just stand there for a while.

152
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,120
You want to marry me?

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
I promised you before I went out.

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,040
I'll propose to your mother

155
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
as soon as I come back.

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,520
I've been fighting with the Lord for so many years.

157
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,040
I've already become a general

158
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
from a small town.

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
When I've saved enough money,

160
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
I'll ask the Lord to come out

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
and propose to your mother.

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
You still have to save enough money.

163
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,000
You're not a general.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're a soldier.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're a soldier.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
How much do you want?

167
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
As much as I want.

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,640
You're not a general.

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,400
If you earn one or two,

170
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,440
I'll wait until the end of the year.

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't you have sincerity?

172
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,400
I really want to marry you.

173
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,960
The more I save,

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,840
the more I'll give you.

175
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,120
I don't need that.

176
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
You don't need it?

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I really don't need it.

178
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Then what do you want?

179
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I don't need it.

180
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,240
I just want it.

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
You're so stubborn.

182
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,160
I don't know if it's because

183
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,760
you're kind or you're a good soldier.

184
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
I don't need it.

185
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Okay.

186
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
What?

187
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Let's take our time.

188
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,440
I'm not in a hurry anyway.

189
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,440
The meat hasn't been cooked yet.

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Where are you going?

191
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm full because of you.

192
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
You look good.

193
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Uncle Zhou is angry.

194
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
It's pretty good.

195
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Let me try it.

196
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
No.

197
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,160
The head is grilled.

198
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You eat that.

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
Do you have to think about eating?

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
What do you mean by not thinking about what the girl says?

201
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
What's wrong?

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm in a hurry to marry you.

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What should I do?

204
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,840
Is your general still here?

205
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,800
Lend me your waist.

206
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
No, no, no, no, no.

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
You eat.

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
The richest man in the whole house

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,600
is sitting in the tree.

210
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,080
Why are you looking for me?

211
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Find him to ask for you.

212
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Eat.

213
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
I heard that

214
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,640
as long as the bride

215
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
wears clothes or accessories

216
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
that are close to the marriage

217
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,520
or pregnant with the woman,

218
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
she can be happy.

219
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
She will be pregnant soon.

220
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Go to the bathroom.

221
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Master,

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
what do you want me to do?

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
I want to ask you.

224
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,840
Are there any strange things

225
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
around Boya now?

226
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
I don't think so.

227
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
I think there should be.

228
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
After this battle,

229
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,320
I found that

230
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
it's not enough

231
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,400
to protect the plague

232
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
just by Xiao Gang.

233
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
The plague is a bird of the forest.

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
It's a soldier's disease.

235
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
It's a disease that can't be cured.

236
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,160
It's a place where soldiers must fight.

237
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
It can't be cured.

238
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Now the bridge is unified.

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
I'm willing to join Boya

240
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
to strengthen the army.

241
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Isn't it safer to have two territories in one place?

242
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't know what the military counselor thinks.

243
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,280
What he said makes sense.

244
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
But it's not urgent.

245
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,000
After the plague is over,

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,600
we can do it again.

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
No, no, no.

248
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,640
I think we should do it quickly.

249
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I'm anxious.

250
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,920
And I have to think about

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
who I should send to go there.

252
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,520
Who do you want to send?

253
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Master.

254
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,040
Master.

255
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,960
Military counselor.

256
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,880
Master, I have a favor to ask you.

257
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Don't say it now.

258
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Just in time.

259
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,520
I just told the counselor

260
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,280
that I was going to strengthen Boya's army.

261
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,480
You go there for me

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
to transport a army.

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Do you have any objections?

264
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,040
I...

265
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,640
All right.

266
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
It's settled.

267
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Depart in time.

268
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Yes.

269
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Of course.

270
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
There's one more thing.

271
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
When you go there,

272
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,560
ask the commander and me

273
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,320
for two of his personal clothes.

274
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,040
Tell him that the female army misses her elder sister

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
and the two sisters.

276
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Do you understand?

277
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Yes.

278
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
And,

279
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
it must be worn in the next few months.

280
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Yes.

281
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
And,

282
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,360
if he prepares some of You Tong's clothes

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
or toys,

284
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
bring them back.

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't ask.

286
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Just bring them back.

287
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Yes.

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
And,

289
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,840
I'll tell you when I remember.

290
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Go.

291
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Yes.

292
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Although the name Li is good,

293
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
there's a different meaning of Li.

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
I'm afraid that I'll have a hard time in the future.

295
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
No.

296
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Feng.

297
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
But I remember

298
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
there's an old friend of mine

299
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
whose name has Feng.

300
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
It's not good for him

301
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
to be so unlucky.

302
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Autumn.

303
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
It's not good to go to the police station in autumn.

304
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
It's not good to go to the police station in autumn.

305
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,960
Have some water, female army.

306
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
The female army has been in a mess for a few days.

307
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,960
They're thinking of giving the name to the baby in the mansion.

308
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Why don't they ask the male army

309
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
to think about this difficult task together?

310
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I'm not sure about that.

311
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I'll tell him when I get it.

312
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
The female army's taste has changed recently.

313
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
In my opinion,

314
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
it's true that the girl is a woman.

315
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Maybe the girl in the mansion

316
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
is a little girl.

317
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
General.

318
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Why are you here so hastily?

319
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Luckily, I sent the messenger in advance.

320
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Master ordered me to come back quickly.

321
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I can't be late for a moment.

322
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
How is Madam preparing?

323
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
General, please come with me.

324
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Please.

325
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
These clothes are not good.

326
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
The embroidery work here is ruined.

327
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
This is not good.

328
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Madam.

329
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
How about these?

330
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
This hairpin is too complicated.

331
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
This gold thread is too yellow.

332
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Xing, put away all these things.

333
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Marquis Wei treats him very well.

334
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
He doesn't lack these things.

335
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
We have to choose some delicate things

336
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
that can be given to his heart.

337
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Madam, you can't do this.

338
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
This is made especially for you.

339
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Do you remember

340
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
the day he sent me and Bizhi out for a walk?

341
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,960
He teased me and said he liked my empty throat.

342
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Madam heard that he was preparing something for the female army.

343
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,960
She wanted to turn over the incense sticks.

344
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Since she has this ability,

345
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
why didn't she say a few more words

346
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
to the female army in Kangjun

347
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
and make it clear to them?

348
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
The more familiar,

349
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
the more I can't open my mouth.

350
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Fan, you're about to give birth.

351
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Why do you have to do it yourself?

352
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Others don't know the full name.

353
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
General Wei Liang said

354
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
that you only need to choose a few ordinary clothes.

355
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Last time when Mom asked me for something,

356
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
it was when I was running away with you.

357
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
She chose a lot of things that I liked.

358
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
This time, I also have to choose some for her.

359
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Fan, you're so nice.

360
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Don't worry.

361
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
We'll take our time to choose.

362
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Xin W liability

363
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Your Highness

364
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,360
The forces that are following us have already turned to Weiguo.

365
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,160
I will definitely make those who betrayed me pay for it.

366
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,680
But what we need most now is to recuperate.

367
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,680
We Liangya can't stand this kind of trouble anymore.

368
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,000
Although this Madam Yunuo is more valuable than Xiao Qiao at that time,

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,640
she can directly bring us 50,000 soldiers and horses,

370
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,000
but because she was so aggressive,

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,680
she caused such a big loss to us today.

372
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,760
We can't blame her for this. I have the intention to raise the army.

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,480
That's not so hasty.

374
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,080
In the end, it's her fault. Your Highness, you can't humiliate her anymore.

375
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,760
I am humiliating you.

376
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,640
I was wrong.

377
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,440
I was wrong.

378
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Your Highness, now that we have fought such a big battle,

379
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,920
will Madam Yunuo betray you?

380
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,840
Most of Weishuang's troops are under the control of Xiuqu.

381
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,040
Liu Yan can't even defeat them. I don't think he's useful.

382
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,920
If General Lin's men can reach us in time,

383
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,720
we can't be sure of the victory.

384
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,720
But now, I think they have been defeated.

385
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,320
We should return to the deadlock.

386
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
General is protecting me like this.

387
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,120
If my husband knows, he will be very happy.

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,600
I just promised my husband that I would fight for him.

389
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,400
Although he's not here now, I can't break my promise.

390
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,800
Why do you care so much about Lord Liangya?

391
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not that I care about him.

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,600
I have no other choice.

393
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Who else in the world dares to fight against Weishuang?

394
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,600
I want to unite all kinds of people to fight against Weiguo.

395
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Someone has to make a mistake.

396
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,880
It depends on whether he dares to do it.

397
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
I can't let him give up.

398
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,160
Lingyicience

399
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,920
Madam earnst, His Highness is inside.

400
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,160
is leaving the world during the calvary time

401
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,120
then the French consorts of the Impственный tipping the

402
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:34,280
Hippocrates bear

403
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
how could you come

404
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
to achieve good things.

405
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
But now it seems

406
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,600
that it's the best time.

407
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,680
What do you mean?

408
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,520
I had a dream last night.

409
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
In the wilderness,

410
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,280
I saw a golden light falling from the roof.

411
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,720
The tree circles are hanging,

412
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
the lotus is in full bloom,

413
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
and the white tail is in full bloom.

414
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,440
When I woke up, I realized

415
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
that the time had come.

416
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
It's a dream.

417
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,480
I can't tell you.

418
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
Your Highness is in the cold.

419
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,720
You're like a dragon trapped in a shallow pond.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm willing to marry you.

421
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
I'll make you the best

422
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,680
in the world.

423
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,840
But I just lost to Wei Shao.

424
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
Your Highness didn't lose to Budi.

425
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
You lost to Bujie.

426
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Bujie lost to Wei Shao and the Qiao family,

427
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,760
and you lost to them.

428
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,560
I had two trials.

429
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,480
My goal was to leave the Qiao family.

430
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,840
But I chose the wrong person.

431
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,040
Once the family of Wei

432
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,440
recognized their ally and family,

433
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,640
they were honest and honest.

434
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,800
The Qiao family is a wise man.

435
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,880
Compared to the Marquis, he's more of a coward.

436
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,440
Your Highness, you'd better leave the Qiao family.

437
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,160
It's easier to break into the trap.

438
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,240
If that's the case,

439
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Madam Yuluo,

440
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,040
why don't you go to the Qiao family yourself?

441
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,880
The Qiao family isn't enough.

442
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
I'd like to help you

443
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
to start a business in the Zhou Valley.

444
00:20:35,680 --> 00:21:00,840
Theanne 【2】

445
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,640
I trust you, I won't let you down.

446
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,120
Since we're together,

447
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,280
I'd like to share the World with you.

448
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,160
Your Highness,

449
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
my fate was uns happiness,

450
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,240

is of using the er stunning power of the Heavenly Arts

454

to destroy the ban managements.

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
I said I was the master and you were the servant.

456
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,640
If you keep forgetting, I'll send you to the underground

457
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,640
and let my father teach you what is respect and compassion.

458
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640

WEREN'T YOU GO UPPERadasAGAIN

464
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,640
But you people just don't visit here often.

465
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Okay, Brother, what is it Wh routes are you taking?

466
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Who will take who?

467
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,920
I work in the small island

468
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,440
Then go to Jiangxi's room

469
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,080
I also asked about Jiangxi's room

470
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,520
No one goes to change clothes

471
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,400
Then go shopping on the street

472
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,600
I just came back from the street

473
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
I learned all the way

474
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
There was a ball head just now

475
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,840
That must be him

476
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,920
What do you mean

477
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
Why are you entangling me here

478
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,120
I tell you

479
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,400
I am Xiao Tao's biological mother

480
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,640
If you make me angry

481
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,040
He wants to marry you

482
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,360
I won't agree

483
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,680
Hurry up

484
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Go go go

485
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,000
mother

486
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
I'll tell him

487
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,160
Xiao Tao, don't be angry

488
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,320
This time I'm in a hurry

489
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,240
I'm in a hurry to do something

490
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,960
Didn't I come back and find you?

491
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
Besides, I have already asked the master for a reward

492
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,680
I saved all this money

493
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,600
Is that enough

494
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,600
soon soon

495
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
soon

496
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,240
When can we save enough

497
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,360
It's almost

498
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,360
Almost done

499
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,320
I don't need a house

500
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
There is a house

501
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,080
Then wait a minute

502
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,200
I said I don't want it

503
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,480
I'll come back when I have enough

504
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,000
mother

505
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,400
Ding Dai left again

506
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
So stupid

507
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
He's not stupid

508
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,520
He just values you

509
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,840
He is afraid that he doesn't deserve you

510
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,440
So I want to do more for you

511
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,200
He is at ease in his heart

512
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I like this son-in-law

513
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,120
Why did Nanjun come back so early?

514
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,040
Come back and get a belt

515
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Change belt

516
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Belt broken

517
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,680
No, I don't like this one

518
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
You help me find that one

519
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,000
The one with the phoenix bird pattern

520
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,640
When did you care about this

521
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Thank you

522
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,160
Thank you

523
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,040
Why are you always sleepy these days?

524
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm a little tired

525
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,160
Then take a rest

526
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,760
There is nothing in the house now

527
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,200
And my grandmother and mother

528
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,280
Don't have to go to work

529
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,560
Sleep more

530
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,360
I'm bored

531
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Did you eat something wrong?

532
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I'll go get Shiyi

533
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,680
No need

534
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
Chunniang told me

535
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,400
He was like this when he was pregnant with Xiaotao

536
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,080
Can't it be the same

537
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,360
She has pregnancy symptoms

538
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,640
You are vomiting and tired

539
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,560
And you haven't been to the family for a long time

540
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,120
I must have eaten something wrong

541
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,200
Do you remember my letter

542
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
Of course i remember

543
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll go find Shiyi for you

544
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,760
what happened

545
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,680
Since Nanjun remembers my letter

546
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
I didn't think of anything else

547
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
No way

548
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,320
Is it so smart

549
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,800
Nothing

550
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,040
I guess happy

551
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,680
Chunniang said

552
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,000
I was pregnant with a baby

553
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,520
Boys and girls are all good

554
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
I like girls

555
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,800
I just haven't thought about it

556
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,760
What name to give him

557
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,880
I went through a lot of points

558
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,560
But I didn't find the right one

559
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,400
How about tomorrow

560
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,600
I'll ask my grandmother when I'm safe

561
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
I remember

562
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,720
There is a beast in Shanggu Huoshan

563
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,160
The name is Feifei

564
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
I heard that people who raise him

565
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,080
Can be carefree

566
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,840
That's not as good as our children

567
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,120
The Romanian name is Feifei

568
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,680
I hope you and him

569
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,120
Can be carefree

570
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,200
good or not

571
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Feifei

572
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Sounds good

573
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,520
What are you thinking about

574
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,600
I'm thinking

575
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,200
Now we are a family of three

576
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,560
There may be four in the future

577
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,960
Five or six

578
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,120
I've been looking for you

579
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,960
Will make your family a new king

580
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,560
Will not break the promise

581
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,000
Bring the water canal to the four sides

582
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,520
Help the people

583
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,760
Trade is a matter of wealth and prosperity

584
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,640
I believe there was no war at that time

585
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
No war

586
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,160
People live in peace

587
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,880
Just think of it as paying for our children

588
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
Pay for the future of the United States

589
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,560
Let our children

590
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
Live in peace and prosperity

591
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,240
Will definitely be

592
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,040
Mom

593
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,680
Our Wei family's son

594
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,120
As long as you are sure

595
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
Will never turn around

596
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,440
I will never let you down in this life

597
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,400
Hurry back

598
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,720
Come and see the show

599
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,400
let's continue

600
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,160
Keep singing

601
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,040
Voice up

602
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Ok

603
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,800
Go, go and walk a little faster

604
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,600
Go

605
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,160
One Jiangmeng

606
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,280
The Great Hall

607
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,640
The Bells of Minsk

608
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,600
Go to hall

609
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,400
What are to brothers

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,240
Be together

611
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,920
Ten thousand

612
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,500
Look into the first

613
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,980
Qiao Zhoumu loves Qi Du.

614
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,100
Qiao Junshou is a noble man.

615
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,220
Qiao Zhoumu is a good man.

616
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,420
Qiao Junshou is a wise man.

617
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,780
Qiao Zhoumu is a good man.

618
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,580
How dare you!

619
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,100
Calm down, Master.

620
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,980
It's just a nonsense.

621
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,340
Can you make up such a rumor?

622
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,460
Someone is trying to ruin my reputation.

623
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,740
Master.

624
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,900
That's all.

625
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,340
Even if you punish me now,

626
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,900
I have to say it.

627
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,220
If you let the one who wants to do it

628
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,820
do whatever he wants,

629
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,900
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

630
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,900
And Yanzhou will be in danger.

631
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,500
What do you mean?

632
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,900
You're the master of Yanzhou.

633
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,900
You have a high position.

634
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,140
But in recent years,

635
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,380
everyone is just

636
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,660
Kang Jun, Junshou, Qiao Ping

637
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:24,700
when it comes to Yanzhou.

638
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,060
Who will mention your name?

639
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,700
Even Yanzhou kids

640
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,660
are left in such a ridiculous way.

641
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,580
You're kind and kind.

642
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,620
But I'm worried about you.

643
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,260
Now the female army of Wei is in danger.

644
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,060
When the young master of Wei comes,

645
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,380
Junshou will be the grandfather of the young master.

646
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,180
When the time comes,

647
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,580
the position of his lordship is ununknown.

648
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:57,780
have this

649
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,660
Get some extra extra senior structure

650
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,080
to protect her

651
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:53,860
the

652
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
I'll pressζ

653
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,580
I feel good

654
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,180
No, no, don't do

655
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
don't

656
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,460
Don't

657
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,420
Remember

658
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,180
remember

659
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,600
Remember

660
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,540
Man Man, wake up.

661
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,140
Let's go.

662
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,700
Man Man.

663
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,140
What's wrong?

664
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,860
What's wrong?

665
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,140
I dreamed that my father and I were in the wild.

666
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,940
There were many wolves behind him

667
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,860
and they were watching him.

668
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,580
But he didn't know

669
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,220
and he couldn't hear it for a long time.

670
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,860
It was just a dream.

671
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,780
Maybe

672
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,300
the baby in your belly moved

673
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,780
and made you feel soft.

674
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,220
It's possible.

675
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,220
How about this?

676
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,940
If you're worried,

677
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,900
I'll send someone

678
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,060
to pick up my father-in-law

679
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,340
and let him live with you for a while.

680
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,180
And let him accompany you in the production.

681
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,020
Really?

682
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,700
Yes.

683
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,060
Really?

684
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,500
There are no soldiers in Yan State now.

685
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,620
He doesn't need to guard.

686
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,660
So he just came to live here for a while.

687
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,260
He should enjoy the peace.

688
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,500
Your father is so nice to me.

689
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,660
Okay, go to sleep.

690
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,820
I'll go tomorrow.

691
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,020
Tang.

692
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,740
Tang.

693
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,460
When I buy the money for the garden,

694
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,420
I'll marry you.

695
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,980
You want to marry me?

696
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,500
I thought you were not happy.

697
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,220
Of course I'm not happy.

698
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,020
According to your way of thinking,

699
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,580
we'll be married after ten years.

700
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,620
I promise you.

701
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,180
I'll get married as soon as possible.

702
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,060
I'll marry you as soon as possible.

703
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,020
Look at the moon. Is it big?

704
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,220
Yes.

705
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,980
It's bigger than the one you drew.

706
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,100
Tang.

707
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,020
I can plant the betrothal gifts and the moon.

708
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,220
But I can't plant the moon for you.

709
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,300
Why do I need the moon?

710
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
I can plant the betrothal gifts.

711
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,740
I can plant the garden.

712
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,340
If you want to plant anything else,

713
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,220
I'll plant it for you.

714
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,780
Plant it?

715
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,380
It's been a long time.

716
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,700
Are you forcing me to propose to you?

717
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,100
That's okay.

718
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,860
No.

719
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,140
What did you plant?

720
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,700
I don't understand anything.

721
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,740
Look at the man.

722
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,860
When the man proposed to the woman,

723
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,420
he hit a snake beast.

724
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,540
It's so funny.

725
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,020
I'll go now.

726
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,940
Come back.

727
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,300
I don't want a snake beast.

728
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,420
Come here.

729
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,140
Did you see it?

730
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,700
A lantern.

731
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm afraid you look like a lantern.

732
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,060
Look to the left.

733
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,420
What?

734
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,260
Blue grass.

735
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,380
Blue grass?

736
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,140
That's the blue grass from our Yan State.

737
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,780
Shi Jun gave it to the female army.

738
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,260
The female army watered it.

739
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,900
I thought he was dead.

740
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,420
But he's been in a bad mood these days.

741
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,580
Isn't he great?

742
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,140
He looked so beautiful when he bloomed.

743
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,220
I've been taking care of him every day.

744
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,380
Blue grass is my favorite thing now.

745
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,420
I know you care about me.

746
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,340
You want me to live well.

747
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,660
But I really don't care about the house.

748
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,260
Besides, you don't have my certificate.

749
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,860
If you really want to marry me,

750
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,740
just give me this blue grass.

751
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,420
The most important betrothal gift is the heart.

752
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,020
Thank you.

753
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,860
Go to the word man for our dad's Government?

754
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,980
What's that?

755
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,140
Same rules.

756
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,500
Whoever losses goes to the world.

757
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,660
What grass are you going to pick?

758
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,140
When did the master name it?

759
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,140
I said we can't discuss it

760
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
What are you looking at?

761
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,700
I didn't see it that big

762
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,940
What's going on? Look carefully

763
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,340
moon

764
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
What are you doing with her?

765
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,540
Xiao Tao said

766
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,860
You are the orchid of Yanzhou

767
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
When I raise this bunch of grass

768
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,420
All the flowers

769
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,860
Xiao Tao is married to me

770
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,460
elited

771
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,540
I

772
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,220
That'll be it

773
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,940
to do what you want

774
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,500
Be grateful I tell you

775
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,100
On

776
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,020
I'm looking for someone else

777
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,020
Help her go to the partying

778
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
You go

779
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
By the way

780
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,220
Bring a batch of cattles back

781
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,700
Come back to marry Xiao Tao

782
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,940
I've got it

783
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,300
Well, this is all right

784
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,340
This is sent to you

785
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,860
I don't know

786
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
You want to marry Xiao Tao, can you be so heartless?

787
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,860
If you can really give this basin, I will be wronged by Xiao Tao.

788
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Li Xiao, do you think so?

789
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,860
Stop, don't drag me into this.

790
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
What do you mean by dragging?

791
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,860
Duo'er, you are so insincere, tell me the truth.

792
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,860
You say yes, I will.

793
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Who is not a trap?

794
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,860
Don't listen to him.

795
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,860
Listen to me analyze it for you.

796
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,860
You are so clumsy, how long do you want to raise this orchid?

797
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,860
You are not unfamiliar with the road of Kang Jun, you can only find it once.

798
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,860
You go to Kang Jun and take Zhao Yun back for the lord.

799
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,860
By the way, bring a basin of orchid, Xiao Tao will marry you when you come back.

800
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
It's a little funny.

801
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Look at your stomach, look at you two.

802
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
You know to pit me.

803
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Today's moon is really big.

804
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,860
How long have the four of us not seen the moon together?

805
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,860
There is no chance to see the moon.

806
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Yes.

807
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,860
When you come back this time, Xiao Tao will accompany you to see the moon.

808
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I will go to see the moon.

809
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Xiao Tao, don't be tired.

810
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I will.

811
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
I am busy.

812
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
Go, go, go.

813
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
Listen to me.

814
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,860
I am leaving.

815
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
Go.

816
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Wei Liang.

817
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,860
Wei Liang.

818
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
Wei Liang.

819
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,860
Wei Liang.

820
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,860
Wei Liang.

821
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Wei Liang.

822
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,860
Wei Liang.

823
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
Wei Liang.

824
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
Wei Liang.

825
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,860
Wei Liang.

826
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Wei Liang.

827
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
Yu Ma came.

828
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,860
You really want to go to Yanzhou?

829
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Yes.

830
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
Why?

831
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,860
To pick up my father, the female monk.

832
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
I am here to pick up my father.

833
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
There is no other way.

834
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,860
Go to pick up a real Yanzhou orchid.

835
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
I will pick it up for you.

836
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,460
Let's go.

837
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Be careful on the road.

838
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Who is the one you asked me to pick up?

839
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,260
My Lord, if the world is going to turn upside down,

840
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
only this person can help you.

841
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,660
This person?

842
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,060
I...

843
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,460
It's you.

844
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
You...

845
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,860
You...

846
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,060
The wind and fire are finally disbanded.

847
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Like the eternal summer, gentle and tender.

848
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,060
A glance of the red and blue,

849
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,060
how can I forget it in this life?

850
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,060
I am willing to cross the sea of flowers to follow your wind.

851
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Waiting for the white-and-white, like the first time we met.

852
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,060
The rain in Jiangnan is not falling on your eyebrows.

853
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,260
The heart is like a durian.

854
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,260
I am willing to cut off the smile that makes you confused.

855
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,260
Even if the wind and snow are behind me.

856
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,260
No matter how many times I have to go through this life,

857
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:39,260
I will never forget this yearning.

858
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,260
I am willing to cross the sea of flowers to follow your wind.

859
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,260
Waiting for the white-and-white, like the first time we met.

860
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,260
The rain in Jiangnan is not falling on your eyebrows.

861
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:57,260
The heart is like a durian.

862
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,260
I am willing to cut off the smile that makes you confused.

863
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,260
Even if the wind and snow are behind me.

864
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,260
No matter how many times I have to go through this life,

865
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:22,260
I will never forget this yearning.
