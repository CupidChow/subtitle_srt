2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will be with you for life and death

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is love the only thing that can last me for life?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why do I feel more and more pained?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You gave me your ordinary care

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never fall again

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will never fall again

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will never fall again

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will never fall again

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only love can make the sky and sea bright

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Only be your hero

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Only be your hero

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can join the army

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,680
Okay, I will borrow his

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, I will borrow his

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, I will borrow his

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, I will borrow his

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Episode 16

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Nanjun, you are back so early today

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I am here to congratulate you

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For what?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you know who is the commander of the army of Boya?

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who is he?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who is he?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your brother-in-law, Bi Zhi

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nanjun, don't joke

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My brother-in-law is just a horse

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You really don't know

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your brother-in-law is quite good

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is not only capable of defeating Xue Tai

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but also more than once

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Since he has such a skill

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
then sister Zhang's life will be peaceful

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But how peaceful can it be?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He is alone in the army of Boya

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There will be all kinds of forces in the future

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to harass him

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But he is alone in the army of Danbo

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He is alone in the army of Danbo

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Uncle is also afraid of your power

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and he is afraid to take him in

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Two people can't go home

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It really looks like the style of your Qiao family

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You were copying the scriptures just now?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you like the brooch I gave you?

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It looks like the new bamboo from the south

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's not from Wuhan

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't dare to take it out because I cherish it too much

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's okay

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's not very precious

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This bamboo

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
is really good

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Nanjun

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Nanjun is working hard every day

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and his head is always painful

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think it's probably because the pillow is uncomfortable

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I made you another one

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Bai Zitu

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He is suitable for Yonglin

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did you embroider it?

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I asked Chunniang to sew it for me

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I chose the fabric

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But the pattern

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I just saw that it was soft and soft

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It should be comfortable to sleep

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you, daughter-in-law

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Nanjun is so strange these days

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He wants to make you study in the house

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The fabric is made of white silk

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You two don't tell me

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
White silk

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You said the fabric is soft

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You don't tell me that the nose is made of jade

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Master

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't worry

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have asked the female army

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This matter

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Give them half the courage

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She doesn't dare to play chess

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What did the female army say?

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Anyway, don't worry

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The pen and paper are ready

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go to the room

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll go to the room

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll go to the room

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Chunniang is capable of

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Defeating Xue Tai several times

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But the Qiao family never recognized him

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He just wanted to find a place to settle down

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The Boya is still helpless as long as it doesn't kill

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And can fight with Xue Tai

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's not dangerous for us

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's best to maintain the line

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Go

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Only a few hundred people

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
General

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The ones who are hunting in the forest are all sharp

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Not like ordinary servants

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wei Shao

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
How dare you really intervene in the Boya

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And let the soldiers wear the cloth

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is the purpose?

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Fortunately, no one attacked

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The previous was the horse slave of the Qiao family

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now it's the daughter of Qiao Yue

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Speaking of

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They are the same family as the bandits

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The two sons-in-law of Yanzhou

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now they are allies

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We don't fight with them

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Retreat

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Xue Tai retreated?

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He just left

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Good brother

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's your fortune

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
General, I didn't help you

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Although Xue Tai retreated

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But we have already sealed the general in the Boya

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In the future, someone will come to harass

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What should I do?

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You lose the lead

134
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The people have already been kind to you

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You find a high place

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wear a handsome flag

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Just ask the people to lead everyone

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In this way

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In the future, there will be more people who will surrender to you

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There will be fewer people who will come to find the position

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What kind of flag should I find?

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can only ride a horse

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's the problem?

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have seen more handsome flags

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Find a piece of cloth

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Xing'er

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But what should I write on this cloth?

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't write the word

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What does the flag say?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It means this place belongs to the people

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If the flag says Wei

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It means this place belongs to the people of Wei

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If there is another accident in the future

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There will be the people of Wei to decide

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If it belongs to the people of Wei

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It will be a nuisance to the Marquis of Wei

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Isn't it a nuisance to the Marquis of Wei?

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This Xue Tai is in the school

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He is separated from Boya and Pan Yi

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This trip is not for the people of Wei

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Just to listen to the false news

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't let people misunderstand

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wei will send troops to Boya

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Madam, how about this?

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Write your surname

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What do you think?

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Good

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Xing'er, go get a few more jars of wine

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We have to thank General Wei Qu

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Go

173
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yu Lang

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
General Yuchi

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Liu Bu

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Take care, General

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Take care, you two

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Go

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Go

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Go

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I helped the Qiao family to get together

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Did such a big thing

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Just bring back these animals

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
These bags of rice

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You are a real uncle

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I only remember the master's order

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't let others think that Wei State intervened in this matter

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's just a ruin in the official son

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I think you are only concerned about hunting and drinking

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A few cups of sugar and poison, you forget your surname

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Master, this matter cannot be blamed on Wei Qu

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Who is so bold to fight with the Qiao family?

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because of a boya, dare to fight with the master

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where is the red tape?

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Master

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Master

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Master

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Master

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Master

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you want to blame, blame the north

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There is a body of meat

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't get it out of my head

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The hard work of the Jiangzhan

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In the end, hung on the old woman's surname

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is this a military union?

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Who are you scolding?

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Master, what I thought of was a misunderstanding

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Misunderstanding

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How can there be such a small thing in this world?

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't need to know who I am

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Master

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is it really as Mr. Zheng said

213
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is it done by the female army?

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I underestimated her today

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You all remember

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Stay away from the Qiao family in the future

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's easy to be a teacher

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Girls, get up

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This little boya

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can give it to you

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But I can't give it to Yan Chong for nothing

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This was a dead flag

225
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I actually called it to be alive

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Pass the order

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Attack the Xiao Gang immediately

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Master

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The Xiao Gang has Liangyao army to defend

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This Xiao Gang was originally Wei State's land

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because 14 years ago

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Someone took advantage of the position

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Qiao family

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Gave me the plate

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is like

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
giving the Yan State a new door.

238
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So,

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we don't need to

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
arrange more troops.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If we want to counterattack,

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
we must give the Yan State

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
a new door.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Bo Ya and Xiao Gang are looking forward to it.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This way,

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
we can monitor the move of the Bishi.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You four,

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
go to gather the troops

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and open the Xiao Gang.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Wei Qu,

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
this is a chance

253
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
to make you regret.

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You must cherish it.

255
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What else do you want, Master?

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
From today,

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
give all the letters

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
to the tea party.

260
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

261
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think

262
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
we should stop getting married.

263
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We are married.

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's not sincere.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't blame me.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You are the one

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
who can be the one.

268
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And Master.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Li Jun.

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is...

272
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You are back so early today.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
These are

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the gifts from Bo Ya.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The rice is also from Bo Ya.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Here.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I prepared it for you.

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is

280
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
from the elder sister?

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You two are close.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You take care of each other.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's very touching.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it's not time for dinner yet.

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't eat it.

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You sewed my shoes

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and pillow

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
for me a few days ago.

290
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And you prepared me a meal.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm grateful for this meal.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Come on.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Try this.

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This meat is good.

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is good too.

296
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I can't eat that much.

297
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is specially made for you.

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You must eat more.

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Eat.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Master Kang wants thick tomato noodles.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Master Kang's tomato egg beef noodles

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
are waiting for you.

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Master said he wouldn't let the people of the Qiao family

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
to be the one.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think so.

306
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Brother Dong.

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Brother Dong, I heard that

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
General Wei Xu is back.

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How is our daughter-in-law doing in Bo Ya?

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm talking to you.

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Brother Dong.

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Xiao Tao.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Stop talking to me.

314
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Our master said

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
he wouldn't let the people of the Qiao family

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
to be the one.

317
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What does it have to do

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
with our family?

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Brother Dong.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Our daughter-in-law.

321
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Xiao Tao.

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I really have a job.

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We've made a mistake in Bo Ya.

324
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We have to make up for it now.

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Master is going to send a soldier to Xiu Gang.

326
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Stop bothering me.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Xiu Gang?

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I really can't eat it.

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Eat more.

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm telling you.

331
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is Bo Ya's rice.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Eat more.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Is there something

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that Nan Jun is looking for me?

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Nothing.

336
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But I just want to ask you

337
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
what you were busy with the other day.

338
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I was copying scriptures for the female palace.

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What else?

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm also studying the literature and poetry.

341
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm also studying the literature and poetry.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What about writing a letter to your elder sister?

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are two types of orders in life.

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, orders in life.

345
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
In the order of life,

346
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it includes the flag that was put on the bridge by Bo Ya.

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just heard my brother-in-law defeat Liu Kou

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and ordered a few.

349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Qiao Shi.

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're so thoughtful.

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't understand what Nan Jun is saying.

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't understand?

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You pretended to be so kind to me

354
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and made me numb you.

355
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then you used the wooden box ceremony

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
to make me feel guilty for you.

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't design guilt.

358
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I need you to be guilty first.

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Then you're using my guilt.

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You pretended to be so kind to my elder sister.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then you used the wooden box ceremony to make me care about you.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Right?

363
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not fake to miss my elder sister.

364
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Then you're guilty of being guilty of the Qin's secret.

365
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Otherwise, why did you talk for so many days?

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's still so bad.

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And you want Bo Ya.

368
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can just tell me directly.

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Why bother to use my people to send letters for you?

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Then you played a play in front of Xu Tai

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
with a tiger's tail,

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
not flying, one soldier, one group.

373
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Bo Ya will be involved in your Qiao family's game.

374
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So my brother-in-law succeeded.

375
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No.

376
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Look at your face.

377
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Look at yourself in the mirror.

378
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It seems that I think too much.

379
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're the father of the Wei family.

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But you're still the daughter of the Qiao family.

381
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
My brother-in-law defeated Xu Tai.

382
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Wei is in danger.

383
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a good thing.

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's not a big deal to put Qiao Jiaqi in.

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Qiao Wei is a family.

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Qiao Wei is a family.

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The South Army won't attack the Qiao family.

388
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Or the South Army and I get married

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
is just a superficial skill.

390
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's why Pan Yi is sick.

391
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't beat you.

392
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You're just a mouthful.

393
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I only have one mouth here.

394
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You're enough to piss me off.

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll explain it to you first.

396
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But remember.

397
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't think you can hide it

398
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
by taking a place of the Yan family.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I will always be on your Qiao family's neck

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
with a knife.

401
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Your Majesty.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why did that Wei family

403
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
attack the Qiao family?

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Your Majesty.

405
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Wei Liang was angry at me

406
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
when he saw me.

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He said the South Army told him

408
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
not to get close to the Qiao family.

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Or he would be stupid.

410
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Listen to what they said.

411
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What are they talking about?

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He was right.

413
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Then they were angry and wanted to send troops.

414
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Where did they go?

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They said they went to Xiugang.

416
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Chunniang.

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
When will Zhang Pu come back to Kangju?

418
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Your Majesty.

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Zhang Pu had a serious illness

420
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
after he came to the army.

421
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He should be not fully recovered yet.

422
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Tell him to come to see me.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes.

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When you go back to Yan,

425
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
can you help me to go around

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
to Boya

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and send a message to Zhang Ji?

428
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm already sick.

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm already sick.

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You...

431
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Can't you just write a letter

432
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and send it to them?

433
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a serious matter.

434
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You need to tell

435
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
your sister and brother-in-law in person

436
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and analyze the situation for them.

437
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I see.

438
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please tell me.

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Wei Shao has sent troops

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
to attack Xiugang today

441
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to hold Boya back.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Actually, there is a place

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
in Yan State called Liancheng.

444
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's close to Xiugang.

445
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It will take about three days

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to get there by mountain road.

447
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Tell Zhang Ji

448
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to let my brother-in-law open the mountain and pick up the mines.

449
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I've marked the specific location

450
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
on the map.

451
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Open the mountain and pick up the mines?

452
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Wei Shao values Xiugang

453
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
because he is close to the mountain

454
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
and can hold Boya

455
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
with his bare hands.

456
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But if we dig a secret passage

457
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
here,

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the troops of Yan State

459
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
will arrive at Xiugang in half a day.

460
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In this way,

461
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Xiugang is the thing

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
in the Yan State's bag.

463
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Madam,

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the female army has arrived.

465
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Grandma.

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Has she been sent away?

467
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Sit down.

469
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Do you know how to play chess?

470
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I know.

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But I'm not good at it.

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's a matter of knowledge.

473
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Beginners always want

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to eat more than others

475
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and kill them all.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But the game is not easy.

477
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So in the end,

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the loser

479
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
will have to

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
let the other person

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
win.

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But the sense of the game

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
needs to be analyzed.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If the two sides are equal,

485
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
the game will be tight.

486
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In the end,

487
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
the game will be tough.

488
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Although we will win in the end,

489
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
it doesn't look good

490
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
in the game.

491
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I will follow your instructions.

492
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you think

493
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm talking to you about chess?

494
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Of course not.

495
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm not your friend.

496
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm your wife.

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm your wife.

498
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You're my wife.

499
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm your wife.

500
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm your wife.

501
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm your wife.

502
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What is your wife's name?

503
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's the way of getting along with each other.

504
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm not an enemy

505
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
but a ally with the southern army.

506
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But maybe Sun Xi

507
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
is not good at chess.

508
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Is that true?

509
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I understand.

510
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
When your grandfather

511
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
proposed to me,

512
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
he wrote me a letter

513
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to say what he had done

514
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
back then.

515
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I hate your grandfather

516
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
because he betrayed me.

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've lost my husband,

518
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
my son,

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and my grandson.

520
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But can a person

521
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
come back to life after he's dead?

522
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Even if I kill

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the whole Qiao family,

524
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
can the pain of our past

525
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and the pain of our heart

526
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
be reduced by a little?

527
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If your marriage with Zhong Lin

528
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
can resolve the hatred

529
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and get rid of the evil in Zhong Lin,

530
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
his rest life

531
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
will no longer be spent in sorrow.

532
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I...

533
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is there anything I can't let go?

534
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Grandma,

535
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

536
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's okay.

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Everything needs a process.

538
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Let's take it slow.

539
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Guards of the Imperial Guard

540
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Juhonggui!

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Juhonggui!

542
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Juhonggui!

543
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Juhonggui!

544
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,600
The Emperor is back!

545
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
The Emperor is back!

546
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
The Emperor is back!

547
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,560
Master,

548
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,360
the battle at Xiao Gang was a huge victory.

549
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,960
The rumors about Liangya Kingdom

550
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,000
were all over the place.

551
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,680
It was a great relief.

552
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,280
I've told you many times.

553
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
Don't just look at the surface.

554
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,880
It's not just to

555
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,800
set up Liangya Kingdom

556
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,320
in Xiao Gang.

557
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
Besides strengthening Xiao Gang's army,

558
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,760
I have four things

559
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,960
to tell you.

560
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,480
Yes.

561
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,040
First,

562
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,760
strengthen the patrols

563
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
of Liangya Kingdom and the border of Xiao Gang.

564
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,320
Master, you're so wise.

565
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,840
Liangya Kingdom has always been on the alert.

566
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,080
Second,

567
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,880
monitor

568
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,760
the contact between Bo Ya and Yan State at any time.

569
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
Master, you're thoughtful.

570
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,800
You need to guard against Bo Ya's invaders.

571
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,800
Third,

572
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
strengthen all the people

573
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,840
at the border of Xiao Gang.

574
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,000
Master, you're wise.

575
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,360
You always keep an eye on the movements of the states.

576
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,840
Fourth,

577
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
what's the fourth matter?

578
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,400
Fourth.

579
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,560
Take me to entered the cave.

580
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,620
I want to fightmayınb minimum

581
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,720
with Qiao Nian.

582
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,600
It's something that

583
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,160
Let's go.

584
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,000
Why are you guys coming in?

585
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Is there any rule?

586
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,640
This is the bedroom of the male and female soldiers.

587
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,600
In the past, no matter if you were always here or not,

588
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,440
you were not allowed to enter

589
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,840
without being transferred.

590
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,240
We don't move in ourselves.

591
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,400
You are the ones who are allowed to move in.

592
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,640
Didn't you say

593
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,400
this is the bedroom of the male and female soldiers?

594
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,480
The male soldiers are going to move in.

595
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,320
Come on, let's go in.

596
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,000
Come on, come on.

597
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Be careful.

598
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,880
Hey.

599
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,840
You are pressing the female soldiers' quilts.

600
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,520
Come on, come on.

601
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,720
Get down.

602
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,200
What are you doing?

603
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
This is the female soldiers' books.

604
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,840
Get down.

605
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,440
Shut up.

606
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
What are you doing?

607
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,280
Why are you touching the female soldiers' books?

608
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,080
No.

609
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,640
You female soldiers

610
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,560
are female and can read.

611
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,960
We female soldiers are three years old, ten characters old, five years old, and ten years old.

612
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Why don't you read?

613
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,720
Okay, okay, okay.

614
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,640
Put these three books on the bookshelf.

615
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,680
Anyway, the master doesn't need them.

616
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
There is no bookshelf.

617
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,280
I'm just asking you not to be ashamed.

618
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,880
I think we should put the sword here.

619
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,360
It's quite suitable here.

620
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,400
You are still putting a sword here.

621
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,960
The male soldiers are practicing swordsmanship.

622
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Our master not only practices swordsmanship,

623
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,560
but also kills people.

624
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
Where is the master's clothes?

625
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,560
This one, this one,

626
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,640
and that one over there are all for female soldiers.

627
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,120
The male soldiers give this one.

628
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,200
So small?

629
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,920
No.

630
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,240
You female soldiers have so many wardrobes.

631
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,280
Did you bring the smoke porridge here?

632
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,760
You four haven't got married, right?

633
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,960
Which wardrobes

634
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,840
don't have the host's things?

635
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,480
The husband.

636
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,240
He's right.

637
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,440
Come on.

638
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,800
Miss Xiao Tao has a bad temper.

639
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
How can she get married in the future?

640
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,800
What does she have to do with you?

641
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,920
Why are you worrying about her?

642
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,720
No.

643
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,600
Don't forget.

644
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,680
She will marry us in the future.

645
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,840
No.

646
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,600
She will marry one of us.

647
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,560
I won't marry her.

648
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I won't marry her either.

649
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,080
Do I need to say it?

650
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,280
Go.

651
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,120
Let's go find the wardrobes.

652
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Okay, okay, okay.

653
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,640
You're not catching the ball?

654
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,920
You're a human.

655
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
You didn't see the female soldiers?

656
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,240
They are like the ones who are robbing the land.

657
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,880
They are fighting for the land.

658
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,400
They have to tell which one is for the male soldiers

659
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,760
and which one is for the female soldiers.

660
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,960
The male soldiers and the female soldiers live in the same room.

661
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,480
How can they tell so easily?

662
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,760
How can they tell so easily?

663
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,320
It's called being good at serving the people.

664
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,680
It's hard to deal with the evil.

665
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,480
I've heard from my grandmother.

666
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,920
Some people need to be taken a step closer.

667
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,720
I've already put Qiao Jia's flag on the edge of the cliff.

668
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,160
She can't wait to find it elsewhere.

669
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,640
Let's put the male soldiers' things here first.

670
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
Then this cup of wine...

671
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,440
Just leave it here.

672
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,440
Okay.

673
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,600
Okay.

674
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,320
I think Nan Jun is sleeping in a bad mood.

675
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm afraid the candle is too bright.

676
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,760
So I want to extinguish the candle.

677
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
Don't light the candle.

678
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,680
When you sleep,

679
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
wear more clothes.

680
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
Don't try to seduce me every time.

681
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,360
You...

682
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm the Marquis.

683
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,200
I won't do that for the beauty.

684
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,120
I don't think so.

685
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,120
You have to listen to me.

686
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,920
If you say no,

687
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,160
then you have to.

688
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,480
Then...

689
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,280
If Nan Jun says so,

690
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,280
just take it as yes.

691
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
Bring me some wine.

692
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
warmth.

693
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,600
Come.

694
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,360
Sir, please.

695
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,880
Master,

696
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
I'm thirsty and suspicious.

697
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,040
We're indeedingt to take a game of games.

698
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Then,

699
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,840
sit here

700
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,320
for a while.

701
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,600
late Chenjiu architect Futian Forgotten Challenges

702
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,920
Master.

703
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,000
Many things

704
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,600
can also be handed to those who love and care.

705
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,200
We don't logically put ourselves through every issue.

706
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,120
But no one understands

707
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,960
I don't know.

708
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
No one understands me.

709
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,160
It's all because Nanjing killed someone in her dream.

710
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,280
She made the female soldier can't sleep.

711
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,600
She said you seduced her.

712
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
She's really a wronged person.

713
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,840
She's afraid that I'll say that on purpose.

714
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,480
The female soldier always helps Nanjing.

715
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,440
She just said it.

716
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,720
She didn't do anything to me.

717
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,920
Forget it.

718
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,800
Help me cook some red bean soup.

719
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,120
xiao zhan

720
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,000
No one knows.

721
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:37,740
every corner gets cold cub

722
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,660
nanjun

723
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
What's wrong?

724
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Nan Jun.

725
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,860
I heard that the micro-monster will kill people in dreams.

726
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,060
Sleeping never lets others think about it.

727
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Nan Jun.

728
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,260
Mr. Xia.

729
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,060
Don't go.

730
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,660
Don't go.

731
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
What's wrong with you?

732
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,460
Are you afraid of the dark?

733
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
I'm fine.

734
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
It's okay.

735
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
I'm here.

736
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
I'm fine.

737
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,860
Don't be afraid.

738
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
I'm here.

739
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,060
I'm here.

740
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,860
I'm fine.

741
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm fine.

742
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,060
Lord.

743
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Not sure you hear me well.

744
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,700
We talked about the

745
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,940
king's sacrifice.

746
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,740
The matter is very items.

747
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,740
What're you going to do with them?

748
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,340
The king's sacrifice

749
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,980
ラ

750
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
I'm afraid

751
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,820
my father

752
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,820
singing and dancing

753
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,780
will be skewed.

754
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
Dance

755
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,140
It's the same for a woman to be with her master.

756
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,580
I always thought

757
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,580
that Nan Jun would be angry at me

758
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
for the Bo Ya incident.

759
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,540
But after a few days,

760
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,700
I found out that he didn't mean that.

761
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,180
Instead, I don't know what I did wrong.

762
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,500
Master has been promoted to the position of master since childhood

763
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,940
and grew up in hatred.

764
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,660
Now, sometimes it's inevitable

765
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,420
for a woman to be cold to her master.

766
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,060
A woman is wronged.

767
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,540
But I've been with my master for many years.

768
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
I know her best

769
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,660
when it comes to her temperament.

770
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,340
What does the military counselor think

771
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,380
Nan Jun is like?

772
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,700
He's stubborn, soft-hearted

773
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,620
and generous.

774
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,980
Otherwise,

775
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,060
he wouldn't allow a woman to stay with him.

776
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,660
Come.

777
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,820
To put it this way,

778
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,220
I was too했습니다 the harsh words.

779
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,180
Thank you for your consideration, counselor.

780
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,080
Cream Yoghurt

781
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,740
To Chat 1

782
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,820
No吻 in the moonlight

783
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,220
Only for this year' dn thought

784
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,980
Neverpassen

785
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,940
Am Stones

786
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,740
I am willing to across the mountains

787
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,100
I am willing across the mountains

788
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,420
Change your star

789
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,360
I hope we meet again

790
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:28,780
It seems that the north enter the shower

791
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,220
It seems that the north enter the shower

792
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,820
Not fallen before your eyes

793
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,780
New Cook

794
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
I will be your boy

795
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

796
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,780
No matter how much I try, it's just for this missing

797
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,780
I will never forget

798
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,780
I will never forget

799
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,780
I will never forget
