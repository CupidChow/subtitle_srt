1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go and tell Zhong Lin

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have already given the matter of Lu Li Tai to Qiao Shi

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will see how Zhong Lin will hide

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who said I can't leave him

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think this Yashu is much better than home

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At least he is free

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Nan Jun, drink some hot soup before going to bed

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your body will be warmer

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The arrangement is getting better

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Nan Jun, you should be comfortable last night

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I have already prepared the dinner for you

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can bring it to him later

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you need anything, you can buy it or come back to get it

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you need money, go to find Xiao Tao Zhi

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you for your consideration

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will take care of Nan Jun

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Just like at home

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will go to the bathroom

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will go to the bathroom

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will go to the bathroom

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will go to the bathroom

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will go to the bathroom

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will go to the bathroom

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will go to the bathroom

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You want Nan Jun to be happy?

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't have that much thought

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just want him to live comfortably

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Go to Lu Li Tai with me

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If Nan Jun has a headache, you can use this cold oil to help him

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The moonlight is still silent

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But it is so beautiful

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I once looked at the world

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I couldn't understand

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The wind and fire are scattered

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want to be tender and humble forever

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The sky is so red

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How can I forget my love

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The stove is ready

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Nan Jun will not get cold

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am willing to cross the sea of mountains to catch your wind

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Waiting for the white tree to be like a tree

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Too much carelessness is for this life

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Never forget your love

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Nan Jun is hungry

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why are you so considerate like a beggar?

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Nan Jun must be used to cooking in the kitchen

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Who prepared this?

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Of course it's the female army

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Female army?

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What about the cold oil?

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Female army

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What about the stove?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Female army

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then why are you laughing when I praised you yesterday?

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Didn't you praise the female army?

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I am in the yasho but I am still in the net

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Nan Jun doesn't like it, so I will prepare it again

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No need

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let me have a bite

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What are the female army doing these two days?

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The female army is busy with the repair of the Luli stage except for the daily order of the slaves to take care of Nan Jun's affairs

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I heard that in order to expand the life of the Luli Congress, they are in a hurry to find people

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you know that there is a famous gentleman who is good at being rich and very talented, named Gao Heng?

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Mr. Zhen Shi Gao Heng is famous for his wisdom and his admiration for people

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This day changes so quickly

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It changes so quickly

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, Nan Jun is still in the yasho

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You should prepare more clothes for him and send it back

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know you care about Nan Jun

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are busy with your hands and you are not idle

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am sorry

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I am sorry

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I am sorry

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am sorry

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I am sorry

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am sorry

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I am sorry

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am sorry

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I am sorry

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I am sorry

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I am sorry

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should bring him one more stove

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Be careful

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That is Nan Jun's favorite

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can't run away from this box

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mrs. Yulou and Nan Jun are not related

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Xiao Zi, the jade pendant on Nan Jun

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think Mrs. Yulou has one too

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Xiaotao said that Mrs. Yulou was over-married with Wei Jiayi

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But don't worry

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's all in the past

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm afraid it's not in the past

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is Nan Jun's dessert

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why do you prepare this dessert for me?

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The female director arranged it

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She said Nan Jun must like it

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I must like it

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Take it

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't like it

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where is my stove?

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The stove is in the mansion

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In the mansion?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The female director said that the gauze is for work

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We can't make it as comfortable as home

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It will delay Nan Jun's work

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What am I doing?

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I am so proud of myself today

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am so proud of myself today

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can take it away

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Whose man are you?

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Take it back

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Wait

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's late

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't disturb her

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No one can talk

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why is the box here?

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The female director sent it

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's Nan Jun's favorite

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's better to keep it

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can go now

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will go now

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Erlang

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Just tell me what you want to do

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't trust Qiao Jia Yuan

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Take good care of her for me

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I will

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are so filial

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But you are so filial

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You will be sad if you know this

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go to find some wine-makers tomorrow

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
To replace the godess

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why is Nan Jun back?

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He lost his temper

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He has a headache

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I will invite him to have a drink today

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
To help Nan Jun

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you doing?

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I am fixing the pillow

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I will try

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I will go now

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I have a headache

154
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I am sorry

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I am sorry

156
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I am sorry

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I will go first

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nan Jun

159
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Nan Jun

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Nan Jun

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In this box

162
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's my grandfather, father and brother-in-law's belongings

163
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I am sorry

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I shouldn't have done it

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I shouldn't have done it

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's my fault

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I should have told you earlier

168
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This jade pendant is actually half

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I gave it to Lin Zhongqian before he died

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And asked me to give the other half to Mrs. Yu Lou

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because they were once in love

172
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My elder brother was a martial arts master since childhood

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He was called the Tianxuan family master

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He fought with his grandfather all the way

175
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He never lost

176
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But until the battle of Xin Du

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He was always a thorn in my mother's heart

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I have been training myself since childhood

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I want to be like my elder brother when I grow up

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Brave, kind and responsible

181
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But I don't know if I can be with him in my mother's heart today

182
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Nan Jun is the best master of the Wei family

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I am so happy to see you

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Brother Zhang asked me to promise him two things

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The first thing is to ask me to take care of Mrs. Yu Lou for him

186
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The second thing is

187
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I failed

188
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do you have a word?

189
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This word is called Manman

190
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Manman

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
General, there are more enemies coming from the border today

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Fortunately, I lost some cattle and sheep

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The people are injured

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
General, find a way

195
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay, I know

196
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Go

197
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes

198
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
General, I am sorry

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I am sorry

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I am sorry

201
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I am sorry

202
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I am sorry

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I am sorry

204
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I am sorry

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I am sorry

206
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I am sorry

207
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Did you meet any trouble?

208
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Fan

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Did I wake you up just now?

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's still early

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you want to go back and sleep?

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What can't you tell me?

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There are people coming to Binzhou today

214
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But there are no losses

215
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But I have been here three times this month

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why didn't you tell me about such a big thing?

217
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mother and father are here

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I was afraid they would worry about you

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I didn't dare to tell you

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I asked for help from my father

221
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He didn't say anything

222
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He didn't want to help me

223
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Father-in-law doesn't want to send troops

224
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He has his own reason

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But I won't be weak

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In case he sees me clearly

227
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I will let you know in the future

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't know

229
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fan

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I know you are worried about my safety

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But the female army is right

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If I don't accomplish my cause

233
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
How can I deserve you?

234
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have followed her orders

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
From Liancheng to Xiao Gang

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
To dig the mountain

237
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is the real big thing

238
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
As for the others

239
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't care

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I will go to the mountain

241
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I will go to the mountain

242
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I will go to the mountain

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I will go to the mountain

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't care

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Since father doesn't want to recognize me

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I will write a letter to ask for help

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Ask him how to do it

248
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But in the end

249
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Boyang is still the wife of the Qiao family

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How does the Marquis want to prove it for me?

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You are a fool

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I said

253
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Weiguo is going to hold a ceremony

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I took this opportunity to show you

255
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes

256
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If I go to the ceremony

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a good news

258
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Marquis Wei recognizes me

259
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If someone breaks the Boya again

260
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He will be afraid

261
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can only see if Marquis Wei has trouble

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I will go to the mountain

263
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why didn't I see you before in the restaurant?

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I am Jingyu

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I admire you for a long time

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Ok

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I will go to the restaurant to find you another day

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I will wait for you

269
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In the underground

270
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I will wait for you

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I will wait for you

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I will wait for you

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I will write a letter to you

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Zhu Quan, send them back

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Marquis, please come to the women's room

277
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The doctor is like a fish

278
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But the doctor said

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He wants to go to the various places to see the scenery

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So he can know how to write

281
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Follow him

282
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Give him a good treat

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes

284
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is the honey and cake sent by Chunniang

285
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's ordered by the women's army

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Thank you

287
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You are welcome

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Thank you

289
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Thank you

290
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Thank you

291
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you

292
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Thank you

293
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank you

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Why didn't she send it personally?

296
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:50,200
She still went to the

297
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,000
I think there are other orders

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Help me choose some high-quality dishes

299
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The most practical

300
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes

301
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Thank you

302
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's rare to have a party

303
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Come, raise your glasses

304
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Grandmother

305
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Grandmother

306
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Grandmother

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Although it's night

308
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But the room looks very glorious

309
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I think it's because my grandmother and aunt

310
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Brought new jewelry

311
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So it's more glorious

312
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's a long day

313
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Look at my hair

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I sent a new one this evening

315
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
By the way, I sent it to my mother-in-law and son-in-law

316
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Mainly Zhong Lin is filial to you

317
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I really follow

318
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Shiyuan, you are good at talking

319
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We all have

320
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You only praise two people

321
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Can't you see the hairpin on Qiao's head?

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Grandma

323
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Sister-in-law wants Zhong Lin to praise

324
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm responsible for coaxing you two

325
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Happy

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I like the hairpin Nanjun gave me

327
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Your style

328
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's just a craftsman left some ingredients

329
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
By the way

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But you like it

331
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Zhong Lin is a good word

332
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why do you say it the other way around?

333
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Isn't it good to praise people?

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes

335
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Come on, let's drink

336
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
To the grandmother

337
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Shi Jun is still great

338
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That girl is now dying for him

339
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
All the people who came to visit all drove away

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is not necessary to marry

341
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Really fake

342
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Where did you hear the rumors?

343
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Everyone in the city knows now

344
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That girl said

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Meet Shi Jun every day

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Meet every night

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And hold Shi Jun's gift

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
A girl's family said so

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It can be fake

350
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Shi Jun is going to get married

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I think it's a bad idea

352
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Don't we know this Shi Jun?

353
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's half a city

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Always flowing

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Want him to die on a tree

356
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Not possible

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No

358
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Xiang Tao Yu gave him affection

359
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Didn't give him a name

360
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is not a girl who ruined her life

361
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You think about it

362
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Which two girls

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The girl from the Chengdu fish family

364
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I really don't know this one

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You don't go to work during the day

366
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What are you talking about here?

367
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We are waiting for the master

368
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Close the door

369
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
We are waiting for the master to go together

370
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
To the duck and rat

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Go away

372
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's not what you said

373
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This Shi Yuan

374
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
In the matter of men and women

375
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Always coming

376
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Now this girl who ruined the family

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's not strange

378
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I haven't heard this from my cousin

379
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't know if it's true or not

380
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Say you hold the girl's gift

381
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I've seen a lot

382
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Today a box of rouge

383
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Tomorrow a handful of wood

384
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know what this time

385
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What is it again?

386
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Madam

387
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This time it's said to be the crown prince's flute

388
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Flute

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
That should be true

390
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If it's a girl from Shi Yuan

391
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I want to see it

392
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What's so lively?

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And you

394
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Tell me

395
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm talking about you

396
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Grandma

397
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Aunt

398
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,120
It's your

399
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because a girl holds her cousin's gift

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Said to be in love with her cousin

401
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You still have to marry

402
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Said you invited her to the mansion to paint

403
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Does your cousin know this?

404
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Paint

405
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Is it a nine-nurse named Yu?

406
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Nine-nurse?

407
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
What nine-nurse?

408
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
She is a girl from the Liang family

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You found it?

410
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You are like this

411
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I won't help you marry someone next time

412
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Since you know her surname is Yu

413
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Is there really such a person?

414
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Grandma

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's a misunderstanding

416
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That day

417
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If it's really a girl you like

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We don't have to care about the family

419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Do you want your grandmother to marry her?

420
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's really just a one-sided support

421
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If I have a heart

422
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I will definitely ask my grandmother to make the decision

423
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:33,460
The

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I invited the girl from the Yu family today

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Just want to ask you

426
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Also for the recent wind and rain

427
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
To make an end

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You see

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I have a family with Shi Jun

430
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I have proposed a marriage for Shi Jun

431
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I am willing to be his wife

432
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In this life

433
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's not that Shi Jun is not good

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I have entrusted Shi Jun with my body and mind

435
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Shi Jun was gentle to me last night

436
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I have to be careful

437
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Last night

438
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He was gentle to me

439
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Smile to each other

440
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Follow me to the dance

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I am in a relationship with my brother

442
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The groom said last night

443
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Meeting every night

444
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You can't miss last night

445
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But last night there was a family dinner

446
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But the second half of the night after the dinner

447
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's the second half of the night

448
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It's a little bit late

449
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Oh

450
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But yesterday, Shi Jun was the most in the party

451
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Beiren is resting in the house

452
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Never went out

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
How did the bride and groom meet with Shi Jun?

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Maybe I remembered wrong

455
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Shi Jun never came last night

456
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But usually

457
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But he comes every day

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Last night

459
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
The past is in front of you

460
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The bride and groom don't remember

461
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
How to marry a new person in the past

462
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have Shi Jun's trust

463
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What I said is true

464
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I am sincere with Shi Jun

465
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I must marry him

466
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The bride and groom are holding now

467
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

468
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I don't know

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You are a weak woman

470
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But you can't be weak and strong

471
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Your Majesty

472
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
My bride and groom are just loving Shi Jun

473
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Shi Jun was so confused

474
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He pretended to be a drunkard and got into the house

475
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He just wanted to see Shi Jun

476
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I think Shi Jun is gentle and considerate

477
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The bride and groom have many dreams

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I hope you can forgive him

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
For the sake of my bride and groom's love for Shi Jun

480
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Why do you ask for it?

481
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now it's the reason you framed others

482
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Take your bride and groom back

483
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Take good care of him

484
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Thank you, Your Majesty

485
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Your Majesty

486
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Chunniang

487
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Tell them

488
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't make any more noise

489
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
The girl's reputation is important

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Don't ruin her reputation

491
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes, Your Majesty

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Why are you here?

493
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I am the female monarch of Wei family

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I will decide the future

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I don't understand

496
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Since my cousin was framed

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why don't you explain it to me?

498
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I am a man

499
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Why should I care about my reputation?

500
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I have many people

501
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't care about my reputation

502
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I am a man

503
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I have many people

504
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I don't care about the rest

505
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But I didn't expect

506
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The reputation is so short

507
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's not good or bad

508
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's what I did

509
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I didn't get framed

510
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I am my cousin's family

511
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I won't let you suffer

512
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Everyone thinks I am a man

513
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I didn't expect

514
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's not surprising

515
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But why do you treat me differently?

516
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Maybe because I know my cousin's character

517
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Even if I am a little bit harsh

518
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I won't betray you

519
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Grandma, grandma

520
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Grandma protects me

521
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Zhongning protects me

522
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Even if they think I am wrong

523
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Thank you

524
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yu's daughter is fond of you

525
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So she picked a flute

526
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
She wants to get a reputation

527
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Who knows you don't mean it

528
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I won't come even if I have no fate

529
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I just see Zhongning and her husband get along well

530
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I also think about the future

531
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I hope they can get married soon

532
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I hope they can get married soon

533
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Otherwise they will be like his mother

534
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
She will be a little bit lonely

535
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't worry

536
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He will find someone he likes

537
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I am like a scholar

538
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I am lost in the middle of the world

539
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I walk through the vast world

540
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I see the mystery

541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I will think of you again

542
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
A flower and a grass

543
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The two trees are in the same place

544
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I am afraid I can't get out of it before I run away

545
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I will never come back

546
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I will never forget

547
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The love is afraid of the past

548
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Too much thinking

549
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Not thinking, not being free

550
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Not simple, not happy

551
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The godmother of the godfather, Amu

552
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's me

553
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The godmother of the godfather, Amu

554
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The godmother of the godfather, Amu

555
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Ok, you can leave

556
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Lord, this is a letter for my wife

557
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What did you write?

558
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Nothing

559
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,720
how to treat your wife well.

560
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,760
Just like before,

561
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,000
you're just showing off your husband.

562
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,120
There's nothing wrong with that.

563
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,720
You've been

564
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,600
always on guard for your wife.

565
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,640
I've never seen anyone love you so much.

566
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,320
It's so hard to be

567
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,640
a man who loves his wife.

568
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
You don't understand.

569
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,840
I also heard it from the Imperial Guards.

570
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,080
They said that

571
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,120
the relationship between the general and his wife

572
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,000
was only established when they were together.

573
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,440
Right?

574
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm really not seeing it with my own eyes.

575
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,000
Their relationship

576
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,720
is really not comparable to other couples.

577
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,880
Then the master and the female army

578
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,800
have made great efforts.

579
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,640
Why don't I see the female army

580
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,480
take the master?

581
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,720
No, Meiling.

582
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,000
Why did you

583
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,320
mention love today?

584
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
Are you going to get married?

585
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,960
Who am I going to marry?

586
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,440
You...

587
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,240
All right, forget it.

588
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,760
Master.

589
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,880
I have something to report.

590
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,680
Go ahead.

591
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,240
Mr. Zhen Shi has done his part.

592
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,880
Done?

593
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,200
Didn't you say that

594
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600
he had no inspiration

595
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
when he was shopping in Weiguo?

596
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,960
Why did he suddenly have it?

597
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,680
It's said that he just arrived at the school.

598
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
He walked for an hour.

599
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,600
Then he started to do it on the spot.

600
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,560
This old man

601
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,720
is interesting.

602
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,200
Master.

603
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,360
Mr. Zhen Shi is not an old man.

604
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,880
He is a young and handsome man.

605
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,520
Young?

606
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,600
Handsome?

607
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm going to the school.

608
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,440
He is very happy here.

609
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,920
I am involved.

610
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,040
You can run.

611
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,480
I finally appeared in Your Majesty's eyes.

612
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,560
This is a жеny.

613
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,520
Master.

614
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Wonderful.

615
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,000
I have come to see you.

616
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,520
Welcome.

617
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Uncle,

618
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,000
you have come and seen this house?

619
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,680
Are you comfortable first?

620
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Is there a second one?

621
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,360
Tell me.

622
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,720
Should you like me,

623
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,960
I should like you?

624
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,560
Then,

625
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,760
Are you available tokyo poem,

626
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:04,760
No. 1,

627
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,680
Life is full of details.

628
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,360
The tips of hated poetry

629
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,520
cannot find any explanation to 딱okyo poem.

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,860
Yes,

631
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,480
The characters that are painted

632
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,920
are taught with the skill of acrostic poem.

633
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,000
You can say that

634
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,760
I'm a genius

635
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,240
Mr. Zhenshi has finally completed the masterpiece.

636
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,680
Let the students read it.

637
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,080
Read it.

638
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,560
Yes.

639
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,760
Good literature.

640
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
It's so beautiful.

641
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,960
We can't compare

642
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,400
the words and the play.

643
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,520
Yes.

644
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,160
Zhuzhou Lv,

645
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,680
Tianxia Qi,

646
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,240
Yangshui Zhu,

647
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
Yongning Chu.

648
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
The seven or eight-mile journey

649
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,840
is the most beautiful day in the world.

650
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,720
The four walls of Weiwu

651
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
are decorated with some skills.

652
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,560
The faith is strong.

653
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
The new capital is here.

654
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,680
The people are in a good mood.

655
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,240
The face is pale.

656
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
The cloth is loose.

657
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,520
The shape is like a cloud.

658
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,360
The man invited the teacher to write a poem

659
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,080
to sing the song of Weiwu and Lu Li.

660
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
He seems to be a woman's king.

661
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,320
Mr. Zhenshi.

662
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,400
Hello, Mr. Weiwu.

663
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Hello, Mr. Weiwu.

664
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,840
Mr. Zhenshi,

665
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
you're really talented.

666
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,640
But you look so handsome.

667
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,160
You don't look like a scholar.

668
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,920
You look like a martial artist.

669
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,880
I don't dare.

670
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,840
I've never learned martial arts.

671
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm not good at it.

672
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
You're not good at it?

673
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,880
Yes.

674
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm good at it.

675
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Whether it's martial arts,

676
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,440
I'm a great man.

677
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,440
Whether it's literature,

678
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm a man.

679
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes.

680
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Mr. Zhenshi is talented.

681
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
He wrote the female king very well.

682
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,920
The face is pale.

683
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,320
The cloth is loose.

684
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,320
The shape is like a cloud.

685
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,920
If you put it on the wall,

686
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,680
the beauty of the female king will be beautiful.

687
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,600
Yes.

688
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,000
Put it on the wall?

689
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,960
I should have read it later.

690
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
So,

691
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,720
you think the cloth is good, too?

692
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,840
Don't worry, Mr. Weiwu.

693
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,640
I have another sentence

694
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,640
to describe the character of the female king.

695
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,280
The bones are like a mirror.

696
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,360
The strength is like a candle.

697
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,840
The light is perfect between the two.

698
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,440
I've heard that the character of the female king

699
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,560
is elegant and handsome.

700
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
If you put it on the wall,

701
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,440
the beauty of the female king

702
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,600
will be beautiful.

703
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,760
You're here again.

704
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,960
I've been wanting to see the beauty of the female king.

705
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
But I haven't found the chance.

706
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,840
What are you talking about?

707
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm not talking about beauty.

708
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
It's beauty.

709
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,800
Speaking of beauty,

710
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,440
I recommend Yunmeng Song.

711
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,480
It can relax the body and open the body.

712
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,200
It can write a mind,

713
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,920
write down a

714
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:29,340
menspearian

715
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,260
It can behave

716
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,840
variously.

717
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,960
If you

718
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,880
wanna visit the female king,

719
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,480
I'm willing to be your guide.

720
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,560
How can I...

721
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,480
How dare you?

722
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,320
How dare you bother me, sir?

723
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm in the army.

724
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,680
I have to take care of my grandmother and grandmother.

725
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,200
I shouldn't go out without permission.

726
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,240
Yes.

727
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,080
But if you want to go,

728
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,120
just tell me.

729
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,960
I'll take you there.

730
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,560
Actually,

731
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,960
no hurry.

732
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,160
The army is here to support you.

733
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,240
I have something to say.

734
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Today,

735
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,800
I ask you to give me your handwriting.

736
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,560
Tomorrow,

737
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,880
I'll give you your good handwriting.

738
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,640
I don't think you need to give me your handwriting.

739
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,960
Sir,

740
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,240
I didn't finish my words.

741
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,560
You have a good taste,

742
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,240
but your words are not right.

743
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,040
I called you here

744
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,240
to sing the great song of Wei.

745
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
But I didn't sing for you.

746
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,480
Sir,

747
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,680
you're too modest.

748
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,400
What the Marquis said is...

749
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,960
Change.

750
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,520
I'll change when I go back.

751
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,120
But Your Majesty,

752
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,160
you're indeed talented and righteous.

753
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,640
I've never seen a rare woman in this world.

754
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,680
What I said

755
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
is all true.

756
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,480
Then I'll give you this

757
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,520
to express my appreciation for you.

758
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,240
Sir, you're so modest.

759
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,360
I don't dare to accept it.

760
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,960
Yes.

761
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,520
I won't accept it.

762
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,760
But it's impossible to put it on the wall.

763
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,160
Mr. Zhizhi.

764
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,320
You should rewrite the words.

765
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,000
It's best to make another song.

766
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,160
Don't go out without making the song.

767
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,440
Let's go.

768
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,760
Tan,

769
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,600
send Mr. Zhizhi back.

770
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,160
Yes.

771
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,480
Marquis Wei.

772
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,320
Marquis Wei.

773
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,120
Wait.

774
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,040
There's no way out.

775
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,440
We have to go this way.

776
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,920
I have an invitation.

777
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
Please watch the show together.

778
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,160
Marquis Wei.

779
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,280
No time.

780
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,960
Mr. Nanzhen is busy.

781
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
Why did you come here today?

782
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,200
Mr. Zhizhi

783
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,600
is talented and talented.

784
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,360
No wonder so many women admire him.

785
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,720
So many people admire him.

786
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,280
He must have seen the role before.

787
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,080
But he's not good at it.

788
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,880
He only cares about the high mountains and the flowing water.

789
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,080
Why didn't you take my hairpin?

790
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,560
Nanzhen said it was made casually.

791
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,040
I guess you don't like it.

792
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,920
So I didn't bring it.

793
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,320
How could I do it casually?

794
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,800
I cleaned it for you.

795
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,760
Thank you, Nanzhen.

00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,920
I'd cross the sea of mountains to catch your phoenix moon

798
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Waiting for your white hand to be like the first time

799
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
The river is hard to talk about, but it's not that I'm falling for you

800
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,920
My heart is sad and I'm crying

801
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,920
I'd rather be a blind smile

802
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Even if there's a storm behind me

803
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,920
I'll live on for this moment of missing you

804
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Never forget
