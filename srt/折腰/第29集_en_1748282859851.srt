00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it true that love is the only thing that can last a lifetime?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel more and more lonely?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I didn't get your ordinary care

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You took my ordinary care

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That love will fall

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you are in my arms and not the wind

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Pass through the mystery and rush to the wind

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is the life of the mountain and the love of the tree

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Give me the sky and the sea

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To be your hero

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will marry you as soon as possible

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have no other choice

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then please come home with me

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to directly draw the two lines as the seal of Mrs. Yulou

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The two-fold marriage of the Taozhou Mu family

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To Mrs. Yulou

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I, Liu Yan, sincerely want to marry Mrs. Yulou

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As my wife

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
As the Princess Consort of Liangya

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From now on, we will be together

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We will live and die together

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Highness, the seal is a secret

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I am willing to

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There is no reason for a daughter to marry a man

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know what the Su family chooses

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What is the Su family's choice

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The emissary of Wushan State has an idea

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your Highness, the Su family has a daughter

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She is the mother of the child

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She is married and can be married to the middle man

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your Highness is right

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our Wushan State will be able to prepare for the wedding

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your Highness, all the dowry has been prepared

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please have a look

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your Highness, this is the wedding dress of Princess Consort of Liangya

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Please have a look

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Come on, send me a team of people

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I want to go up the mountain in person

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
To get a snake and a beast for her

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mrs. Yulou

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Highness

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come and see

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you like these things?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:05,080
I have sent Wushan State to the

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yongning District is progressing smoothly

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Your Highness's action is not too late

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am willing to help with 50,000 soldiers

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
To show my sincerity

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Since Mrs. Yulou has such sincerity

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then I will go to the Wei State

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To share with you

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Your Highness, you must do it

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Get the troops and set out

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Wei State

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's go there first

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If we are late, we won't be able to catch up

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Great Madam is really nice to us

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Your Majesty

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What good news?

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Great Madam is going to prepare the wedding dress for Your Majesty

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She is going to make a new dress

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She is going to be married soon

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am thinking of giving thanks to everyone

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Everyone is happy to thank Great Madam

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Great Madam came to tell me

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That the female soldiers are going to go over to measure the body

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You must measure it accurately

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Otherwise, the new dress will not fit

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When I was young

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My body was as good as hers

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Different ages have different beauties

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In a woman's life

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The mind and intelligence are the most important

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The family is the most reliable

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Although so

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But when grandmother and grandmother were young

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They were definitely roles

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Otherwise, how could they have such a handsome son?

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Listen to this

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A short sentence

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Compliments us a few people

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Counting how sweet his mouth is

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's okay to be a little loose

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Comfortable

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After the wedding dress is over

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You and Zhong Lin can get married

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you are pregnant

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You won't be able to wear it

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Great Madam, the male soldiers are here

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Grandmother, mother

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I was just talking about you

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In a few days

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After the wedding dress is over

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can get married

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
My grandmother and I are waiting to have a grandson

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Mother

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have been working hard to get ready for the wedding

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have more time to rest

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Grandmother

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I have something to discuss with the female soldiers

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll leave first

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it is good

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why don't you mention it?

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm talking about good things

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
One year ago

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When we were married

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I happened to catch up with your grandfather who just died

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But the situation is forced

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's hard for you this year

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Nanjun

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This year

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I never dare to mention my grandfather's name in front of Nanjun

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You are reminded of his regret

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I really miss him

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Mother

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can tell me everything in the future

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry

161
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,680
Your Majesty.

179
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,720
Your Majesty.

180
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Have you read the letter

181
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,360
under the box?

182
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,080
No.

183
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,880
The one that Madam Ding

184
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
put under the box?

185
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
Your Majesty, it's time to read it.

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
I've asked around.

187
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
There's never been a maid

188
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
who's been to the manor.

189
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,280
She must be a clueless person.

190
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,360
She's a bit reckless.

191
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm afraid she'll hurt the manor.

192
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,920
I'll see.

193
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,120
I'll see.

194
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't say it.

195
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,160
I'll go get it.

196
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,920
Go.

197
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,000
Forget it. I'm not eating.

198
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Get the horse ready and go back to the manor.

199
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,000
So sweet!

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
��릴게요

201
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,680
I will never regret

202
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,240
the blood and tears I shed in this life.

203
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,280
The blood that I shed

204
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,560
is to be with you for the rest of my life.

205
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Looking at the future,

206
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,560
I will turn around and say goodbye to the youth.

207
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,760
The wind in my eyes is wavering.

208
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,360
If I can be with you,

209
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,400
I will never regret the blood and tears I shed in this life.

210
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,520
For a hundred years,

211
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
it has been the same.

212
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,680
The sun and the moon are both bright.

213
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,240
The flowers are all gone.

214
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,400
The clouds and the moon are all gone.

215
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,040
It's like you are gone.

216
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,600
I look forward to your return in the next life.

217
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Are you scared?

218
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm not scared.

219
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Then I'm not scared either.

220
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
The other day, Nan Jun married me.

221
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
It wasn't a coincidence.

222
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
He even allowed me to be a grandfather for a year.

223
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Thank you, Nan Jun.

224
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
It's what I should do.

225
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
When I married you a year ago,

226
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,240
we both looked at each other's faces and guessed each other.

227
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,240
How could we sleep in the same bed?

228
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
What about today?

229
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
What about today?

230
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Today,

231
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
you are a genius who has been with me for a long time.

232
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
You are the first person I love.

233
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,240
And it's my honor to have you in this life.

234
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,240
If you don't marry him,

235
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,240
he won't have any children.

236
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
If your son doesn't marry him,

237
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
you'll have to be in Lwise Hall.

238
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
What?

239
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,240
I'll be totally ruined by them.

240
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
There is no home

241
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,040
I once traveled the vast world

242
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,040
with the help of the cold.

243
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,440
In the fire of wind,

244
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,840
I want to engrave my tenderness.

245
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
In the starry sky,

246
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,840
how can I forget you in my life?

247
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,240
I'm willing to cross the sea of mountains

248
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,240
to hold your hand

249
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
and wait for the white-clad rain to fall.

250
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,640
The words of Jiangnan are not in your eyes.

251
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
I miss you.

252
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm willing to give you a smile

253
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,040
even if it's a storm.

254
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,440
No matter how many times I have to think about you,

255
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,440
I will never forget you in my life.

256
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm willing to cross the sea of mountains

257
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,440
to hold your hand

258
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,440
and wait for the white-clad rain to fall.

259
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,440
The words of Jiangnan are not in your eyes.

260
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,440
I miss you.

261
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,440
I'm willing to give you a smile

262
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,440
even if it's a storm.

263
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,440
No matter how many times I have to think about you,

264
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:43,440
I will never forget you in my life.

265
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,440
Master!

266
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,440
Stop making noise! I heard it!

267
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I have something to report!

268
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
What is it?

269
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,640
Emergency military situation! Master, open the door!

270
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
What emergency situation? We'll talk about it tomorrow!

271
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
The case is being destroyed!

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,640
What?

273
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
It's a surprise!

274
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,440
The official discount is 80% off.

275
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,040
The discount is cheaper.

276
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,840
The monster is a surprise!

277
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,440
Liu Yan took 200,000 soldiers and horses to leave.

278
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,640
But there are no people on the mountain.

279
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,240
So we'll go to Xiao Gang.

280
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,640
And let Qiao Ping go to Kang Jun.

281
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,040
Then we can destroy them all.

282
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Yes!

283
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,440
No!

284
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,640
Master, Liu Yan attacked Xiao Gang.

285
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
There are 100,000 soldiers and horses.

286
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,840
Don't let them be destroyed.

287
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Why did he arrive at Xiao Gang in half a day?

288
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,440
What?

289
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
The soldiers arrived at Xiao Gang in half a day?

290
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,440
Qin Wei Liang said

291
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Liu Yan found the secret passage between Xiao Gang and Lian Cheng.

292
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
I have to tell Nan Jun about the secret passage.

293
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,040
No need.

294
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,040
I know it too.

295
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
I'll go first.

296
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,640
I have something to tell Nan Jun.

297
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,240
Don't you have something to say?

298
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,440
Say it.

299
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
That secret passage

300
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,440
was indeed the secret passage

301
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
that I asked my brother-in-law to open.

302
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,440
It was indeed the secret passage that I asked my brother-in-law to open.

303
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,440
I don't know if Nan Jun remembers it.

304
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,640
The last time I took off my coat,

305
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,840
you went out to attack Xiao Gang.

306
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I made a decision to set up a defense.

307
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,840
Based on what you said,

308
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,440
it's my fault.

309
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
It's my fault.

310
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Nan Jun was injured today. It's not what I want.

311
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,440
But now, we should think of a way to defeat the enemy.

312
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
I can stand it if you want to punish me again.

313
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,240
What do you mean by that?

314
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,640
How can I defeat the enemy?

315
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,840
Now Liu Yan is following your secret passage and attacking Yan State.

316
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,040
He's attacking Weigun State. How can I defeat him?

317
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,040
I didn't expect you to let me go.

318
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,240
Nan Jun, why do you say that?

319
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
You doubt my feelings for you.

320
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
You didn't do it before.

321
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,040
Zhu Li, Su Mian and Qiao Zuo,

322
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,240
we got married under that condition. How can I not care about you?

323
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,640
You told me on your birthday party that day.

324
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,840
I knew I had been in love with you for a long time.

325
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,640
You know everything after that.

326
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,640
You didn't tell me about it today.

327
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Yes. You're afraid of me when you marry me. So you're afraid of me.

328
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,040
You didn't tell me when you wronged me.

329
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,640
I always thought I was a bad person.

330
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm grateful that you came to comfort me.

331
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,040
But I didn't expect that I'm not the only one who's not afraid.

332
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Did Nan Jun really give up his revenge?

333
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
If you didn't marry me, you wouldn't attack Yanzhou, right?

334
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
Are you serious?

335
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,440
I'm your grandfather. I'm going to send your sister to the festival.

336
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll walk with you Qiao family like relatives.

337
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,040
You're telling me this now.

338
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,440
You did this because you wanted to marry me

339
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,240
or you've already let go of your hatred?

340
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
God's hatred.

341
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,840
You said you wanted to marry me because you wanted to save my life.

342
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
You're already a kind person.

343
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,040
But people's feelings will change.

344
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,240
If you get tired of me one day, and you kill Qiao family, what will you do?

345
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,040
If you say those three words again, I'll kill Liang Yang first.

346
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm sorry.

347
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
This matter...

348
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,040
is indeed my fault.

349
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,240
But if I don't tell you something,

350
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,240
I'm afraid you'll take me more seriously.

351
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,240
I can see your sincerity.

352
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,840
I can do anything for you, even if it's for life.

353
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Enough, stop talking.

354
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,240
Now the enemy is in front of us.

355
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,240
The enemy hasn't attacked yet, and they hurt their own people first.

356
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,640
You always say things that can change.

357
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,840
You want me to save Yanzhou, of course I can say anything.

358
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Lan Jun.

359
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Don't worry.

360
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Only Wei Liang and the others know about this.

361
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
I'll protect your life.

362
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
The King's Mansion

363
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,840
Great Madam, Nan Jun is waiting outside.

364
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,040
Ask him in.

365
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,640
Yes.

366
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,040
You're late, Grandmother. I have something important to do.

367
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Sit down first. Let's discuss this chess.

368
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,040
Look at this chess.

369
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Next word.

370
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,640
I played a chess with Qiao Shi before.

371
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,240
I told him that the two of them are living together.

372
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,840
No need to worry about winning or losing.

373
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Look at this chess today.

374
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,640
It's the last game.

375
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,440
Grandmother, Su'er's night knife skill is indeed important.

376
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Liu Yan is divided into two groups.

377
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,840
They attack Pan Yi and Lian City separately.

378
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,040
I weakened my military power because I was training Xu Yi.

379
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,240
He's forcing me to make a mistake.

380
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,440
Do you have any decision?

381
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,640
Pan Yi is the water source of Yong Ning Qu.

382
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,440
It's also about the life of Wei State.

383
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,840
And Lian City is also about the survival of Yanzhou.

384
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,440
We've allied with Qiao's family.

385
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,040
We agreed to guard Yong Ning Qu together.

386
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,440
Yanzhou is the mother of Qiao's family.

387
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,240
It's hard to avoid.

388
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,640
Do you have any other concerns?

389
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,040
I want to ask Grandmother.

390
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,240
Can we really send troops to help Qiao's family?

391
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,040
Can we really not care about the blood and grudge of the past?

392
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Of course.

393
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
If you don't send troops now,

394
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,240
what's the difference between the trust and the anger of Qiao's family?

395
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,240
You don't have to worry about me.

396
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,040
When I accepted this marriage,

397
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,840
I thought about this day.

398
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,440
I want to make a wish.

399
00:28:38,200 --> 00:29:04,740
Yuzhuan...

400
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,740
You're still upset?

401
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,920
Brother Dong told me today

402
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,840
that the Southern Army has long stopped monitoring the female army's morale.

403
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,320
It means that the Southern Army is sincere to the female army

404
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,800
and trusts them.

405
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,520
He is sincere to me.

406
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,080
But I never trusted him.

407
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,880
I made him sad.

408
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,000
I have the medicine of Yanzhou

409
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,280
and the medicine of Weiguo.

410
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,760
If he wants to give up Liancheng,

411
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,360
I won't blame him.

412
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,600
Your Majesty,

413
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,800
Zhong Ao sent someone to send a message just now.

414
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,440
He said that the Southern Army is sending troops to help Liancheng.

415
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,600
Mother,

416
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,440
you didn't hear wrong, right?

417
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,040
Are you sure that it's helping Liancheng

418
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,400
instead of fighting against Liancheng?

419
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,560
My child,

420
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,120
did I hear wrong?

421
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,320
He said that he would leave at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

422
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,520
Your Majesty, how about I do it?

423
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,040
Don't break my eyes.

424
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,400
It's okay.

425
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,960
After I leave with Master,

426
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,800
you should search the place day and night

427
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,760
and be careful.

428
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,480
Don't you agree?

429
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,280
Yes.

430
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,240
Brother Dun.

431
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,280
Xiaotao.

432
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,920
Let me help you wipe the shield.

433
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,200
Here.

434
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,000
Don't worry.

435
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm good at fighting.

436
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
I won't get hurt.

437
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm not afraid of you.

438
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
I'm not afraid of you.

439
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm not afraid of you.

440
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm not afraid of you.

441
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I'm not afraid of you.

442
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
I'm not afraid of you.

443
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm not afraid of you.

444
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
I'm not afraid of you.

445
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,120
I'm good at fighting.

446
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,040
I won't get hurt.

447
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,080
After you go to the battlefield,

448
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,280
you should fight bravely

449
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
and get Liancheng back.

450
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
Liancheng. Liancheng.

451
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,160
I know Liancheng.

452
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Don't worry about me.

453
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Why should I not worry about you?

454
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,600
Master is right.

455
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,400
You're a girl from Yanzhou.

456
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
A girl from Yanzhou?

457
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,600
What's wrong with a girl from Yanzhou?

458
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,800
Last night, the female army

459
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,680
made a night for the male army.

460
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,960
The male army was in pain.

461
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,280
Okay. Okay.

462
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
Just give it to me directly.

463
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
Help me to clean the shield.

464
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Are you tired?

465
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
What's wrong?

466
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,080
Then you

467
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
come back safely.

468
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,520
I'm waiting for you to propose to the female army.

469
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,200
Propose?

470
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Who?

471
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,920
Shield.

472
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Don't worry.

473
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,280
With your safety talisman,

474
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,800
I can protect you.

475
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
I'll protect you.

476
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,440
Even if I get hurt,

477
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,800
I'll come back and propose to your mother.

478
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,040
You won't get hurt if you say so.

479
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,000
You won't get hurt if you say so.

480
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,600
You won't get hurt if you say so.

481
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,760
But you have to go.

482
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,000
You three should be safe.

483
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,220
How was the lesson today?

484
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,700
We've been implementing a new strategy today for officially opening.

485
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,500
Miss Lu,

486
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,780
how about we just send the proposal to the female army?

487
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

488
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,680
Then

489
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,620
we can make our own decision.

490
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Okay.

491
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,260
phải病病 selfie.

492
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,240
What are you doing here?

493
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,860
I was in the battlefield

494
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,700
embroidered double side armor armor

495
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
and help me.

496
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,580
I'm honored to have thene promoted

497
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,180
as our General of Wei for hypnotise gene with fades.

498
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,540
Are you satisfied this time?

499
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,740
to get married.

500
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,780
But don't worry, Your Majesty.

501
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,260
I'll go to the Boya to invite Yuan Jun

502
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,380
to guard the rear for you.

503
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I'll go to the Boya to invite Yuan Jun

504
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,980
to guard the rear for you.

505
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
The Boya

506
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I've decided

507
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,060
to guard the plate

508
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,940
and the Yan State.

509
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,820
Wei Xiao.

510
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,820
Yes.

511
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,300
You'll guard the rear

512
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,220
and lead 50,000 soldiers

513
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,620
to defend the Yan State.

514
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,660
Yes.

515
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,100
Wei Xu, Wei Duo.

516
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,460
Yes.

517
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,860
You two will go to the plate with me

518
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,460
to push Liang Ya Di Jun.

519
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,580
Yes.

520
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,100
Wei Liang.

521
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,620
Yes.

522
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,020
You'll lead 50,000 soldiers

523
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,020
to the forest

524
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,700
and prepare to set off.

525
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,860
Yes.

526
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,420
Bring the wine.

527
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,900
The wine.

528
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,700
And take our Wei family's brave sons

529
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,100
to the battle.

530
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,540
I'll wait for your victory.

531
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,740
Don't worry, Grandmother.

532
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,860
I'll be back in no time.

533
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,940
You'll be back in no time.

534
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,620
You'll be back in no time.

535
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,100
You'll be back in no time.

536
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,660
You'll be back in no time.

537
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:49,860
Let's go.

538
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,980
My son.

539
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,940
You're born to be a woman.

540
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,460
When I was looking at you,

541
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,740
I saw a strange figure.

542
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,540
I knew you were destined to be here.

543
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,860
I know

544
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,620
I can win.

545
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,300
I'll be waiting for you.

546
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,300
Don't worry, Mother.

547
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,700
Help Madam down.

548
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,780
Be careful.

549
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,460
Be careful.

550
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,860
Let's go.

551
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,140
Mr. Zhong.

552
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,980
You'd better watch the show.

553
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,620
When will you get to know them?

554
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,140
It's different when you're back.

555
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,340
You're being rude.

556
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:41,980
You...

557
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,660
You're being rude.

558
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,100
Let's go.

559
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,860
Let's go.

560
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,820
No.

561
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,220
Grandma, Grandma.

562
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,060
I have a favor to ask.

563
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,780
I hope you can allow me.

564
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,100
What is it?

565
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,180
I want to visit Bo Ya.

566
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,900
Zhong Lin just left.

567
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,980
He risked so much

568
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,260
to send troops to save Yanzhou.

569
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,620
You're going out?

570
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,140
This is...

571
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,580
I'm not going to play.

572
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,340
I want to go to Bo Ya to save the troops.

573
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,220
The South Army is divided into two groups.

574
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,980
They're going to Liancheng and Panye.

575
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,620
But the enemy is strong and the odds are low.

576
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,460
So I want to go to Bo Ya to help the South Army.

577
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,660
Please allow me to go.

578
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,020
If you really come to save the troops,

579
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,020
Zhong Lin will come back safe and sound.

580
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,220
From now on,

581
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll do whatever you want

582
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,220
in the mansion.

583
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,300
Bo Ya is a long way.

584
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,860
But for Zhong Lin,

585
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,940
I can only let you go.

586
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,980
I have 500 soldiers.

587
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,220
I'll send General Wei Xiao to escort you.

588
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,700
Then you can go to Bo Ya

589
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,740
with them by your side.

590
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,060
Yes.

591
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,700
Go.

592
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,420
Thank you, Grandma and Grandma.

593
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,660
I won't let you down.

594
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,980
Be careful on the road.

595
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,820
Xiao Tao,

596
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,740
go to General Kang and send a message to A-Si.

597
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,860
Tell him to support the South Army in Liancheng.

598
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,460
We're divided into two groups.

599
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,740
We'll win this battle.

600
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,420
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

601
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,420
Young Master.

602
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,940
Liang Ya sent troops to besiege Pan Yi and Liancheng.

603
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,340
We should help them as soon as possible.

604
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,060
Yan State and Wei State are being surrounded.

605
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,580
How does it have anything to do with us?

606
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,780
We're building waterways together.

607
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,780
It's a alliance.

608
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,780
We should help them.

609
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,740
Shi Yuan.

610
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,580
This is Bian State.

611
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,460
This is my home.

612
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,100
You're a man of a low family.

613
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,060
You're a man of a low family.

614
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,300
You're a man of a low family.

615
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,220
It's not right.

616
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm Wei State's son.

617
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,460
Young Master.

618
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,500
Then you'll be my soldier.

619
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,860
I'll help you

620
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,300
if you need help.

621
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,180
I'll help you if you need help.

622
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,380
You're not qualified.

623
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,900
What do you need to help?

624
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,500
Are you from Wei State

625
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,220
or from Liancheng?

626
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,900
Shi Yuan.

627
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,900
I'm afraid you won't be able to help me.

628
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,300
You...

629
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,260
Thank you, everyone.

630
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,780
Generals, let me propose a toast to you.

631
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,860
Okay.

632
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,260
Thanks to you,

633
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,180
we're able to have a peaceful life in Bian State.

634
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,100
You're welcome.

635
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,940
Cheers.

636
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,380
You're a man of a low family.

637
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,460
How did you give birth to

638
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,580
such a coward son?

639
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,940
It has nothing to do with you.

640
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,500
It's all Wei State's doing.

641
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:40,100
You're always so

642
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,660
였.

643
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Impave and

644
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,820
You're a coward.

645
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,540
You only know how to make people suffer.

646
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,900
Why don't you fight together?

647
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,340
Proceed.

648
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,180
Yes.

649
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,700
What?

650
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,180
Do you want to be the chief nhi glance?

651
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,500
There will be no pangpang

652
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,600
де

653
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,720
Rou Rou Rou has not come

654
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,920
Boy with long hair

655
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
Ant others

656
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,900
Oops

657
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:05,940
OK

658
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,520
Come join us

659
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,680
psychotic

660
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,140
The next episode will be about the

661
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,220
Wei Shao, Wei Yan, Wei Liang, Ke Lu, Wei Tai

662
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,620
Inviting you to join the guard team

663
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,380
to watch the show with the 39 Wei Tai cards

664
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,020
Watch the show together

665
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,260
Xiao Zhe gossip, secret kiss

666
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,660
Yang Hao Wei, guard the Wei Fu Tian Tuan

667
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,220
I think he is very warm-hearted

668
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,540
He came to the scene and told me

669
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,580
Brother Liu, don't worry, I'm not afraid of the fall

670
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,300
It's okay

671
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,900
Yes

672
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,340
Don't worry about revenge

673
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,660
I thought

674
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,940
He cares about my feelings

675
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:49,860
Yes, it's okay

676
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,980
And I believe in Brother Liu

677
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,580
Even if I'm really heavy today

678
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,260
At least he will let me fall safely

679
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:55,780
Yes

680
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,140
That day was like this

681
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,540
Because he wanted to cooperate with me to hug him

682
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,180
It's easy

683
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,300
So he had his arms on my shoulder

684
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,700
So we will be very smooth

685
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,900
That posture is good

686
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,500
And it's very smooth to hold

687
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,020
And then

688
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,660
But that one has a seal

689
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,060
He will have a seal on the scene

690
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,060
Keep blowing him

691
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,540
And he's actually in front of me

692
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,180
At that time, it was cold

693
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,060
It was cold

694
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,220
And then

695
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,500
Actually it's okay

696
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,060
Because he has a lot of stockings

697
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,980
I wear stockings

698
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,500
I have two stockings

699
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,700
Sometimes many netizens told us

700
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,340
Say that you feel comfortable to hold your mouth

701
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,180
Of course, it's a credit to him

702
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,620
It's really light

703
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,700
He was originally a muscular man

704
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,020
No, no

705
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,020
No

706
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,540
No, no

707
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,260
When I read the script

708
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,020
This little Qiao is a very

709
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,260
A girl who can control me very well

710
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,540
A very smart girl

711
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,580
But her treatment is

712
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,820
To make her smart in some things

713
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,580
But she has shortcomings in some things

714
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,860
Make this person more lively

715
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,540
Teacher Liu is a

716
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,620
Look silly

717
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,260
But a very smart

718
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,140
A person with logical thinking

719
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,020
I'm sorry

720
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,020
I'm sorry

721
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
I'm sorry

722
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,020
I'm sorry

723
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
I'm sorry

724
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,020
I'm sorry

725
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,020
I'm sorry

726
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
I'm sorry

727
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,020
I'm sorry

728
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,020
I'm sorry

729
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,020
I'm sorry

730
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
I'm sorry

731
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
I'm sorry

732
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
I'm sorry

733
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
I'm sorry

734
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
I'm sorry

735
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
I'm sorry

736
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
I'm sorry

737
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
I'm sorry

738
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,020
I'm sorry

739
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,020
I'm sorry

740
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,020
I'm sorry

741
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,020
I'm sorry

742
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,020
I'm sorry

743
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,020
I'm sorry

744
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,020
I'm sorry

745
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,020
I'm sorry

746
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,020
I'm sorry

747
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,020
I'm sorry

748
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,020
I'm sorry

749
