What?

31

Do you want to take advantage
of my injury?

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
We...

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,660
You're both virtuous and gifted.

34
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,570
We will obey your orders from now on.

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,170
Young Master.

36
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,900
Great!

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,890
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Greetings, My Lord.

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,780
You're truly worthy to be my son.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,980
Now that these generals

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
have pledged their loyalty
of their own accord,

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,170
your title of Young Master

42
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,690
is well deserved, Shiyuan.

43
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,570
From now on...

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,980
I am no Young Master.

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,060
I was raised on the Weis' grain and rice.

46
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,380
I have no desire to become
the Governor of Bianzhou.

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,220
You...

48
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,500
You unfilial son!

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
Unfilial son?

50
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,660
Just answer me one question.

51
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,380
Was it you

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,220
who abducted my mother?

53
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,010
Enough!

54
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,340
Since you refuse to be the Young Master,

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,850
then go guard the border.

56
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,940
Return only when you've come to your senses.

57
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,340
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

58
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,820
My Lord,

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,780
guarding the border is harsh.

60
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,690
It's always in turmoil there.

61
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,850
Why must you send the Young Master himself?

62
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,170
I know full well the hardships he will face.

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,010
But the Weis

64
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,570
forces a wolf to act as a hound,

65
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,690
breaking his spirit

66
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,450
and dulling his edge.

67
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,980
I must forge that edge within him.

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,340
Only then

69
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,540
can he become Lord of Bianzhou.

70
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,340
My Lord, your devotion

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,890
moves me deeply.

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,940
My Lord,

73
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,140
once we cross the bridge, we reach Panyi.

74
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,100
Liu Yan has split off
100,000 troops to attack Panyi.

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,700
We only have 30,000 now.

76
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,660
Even if we add the 30,000 stationed in Panyi,

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,850
the difference is still enormous.

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,540
Don't worry.

79
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,980
Her Ladyship has promised

80
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,170
to bring reinforcements from Boya.

81
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,460
Her Ladyship did promise,

82
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,980
but who knows if the Qiaos

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,220
will break their word and betray us again

84
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
like they did 15 years ago?

85
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,130
Cross the river!

86
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Hyah!

87
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,580
Cross the river!

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,820
Hyah!

89
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,540
Hyah!

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,660
(Panyi City, Wei State)

91
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,020
My Lord, a report from the front.

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,250
Wei Shao is leading 30,000 troops

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,370
to reinforce Panyi.

94
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,780
They'll reach the battlefield tomorrow.

95
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
You may go.

96
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,890
Yes.

97
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,610
Only 30,000?

98
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,050
Wei Shao and Lady Qiao
truly love each other and stand united.

99
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,930
He'd risk his life to protect the Qiaos.

100
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,050
My Lord,

101
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,410
Panyi City is hard to breach
and easy to defend.

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,140
We've already lost 20,000 warriors.

103
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,580
Now that Wei scoundrel
is flanking us from behind.

104
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,100
What do you say?

105
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,180
Calm down.

106
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,850
We still have 20,000 reinforcements en route.

107
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,140
This time,

108
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,460
I will not let Panyi

109
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,700
fall into his hands.

110
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,540
Manman brought so many troops,

111
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,980
with a general escorting her.

112
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,140
Clearly, Lord of Wei

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,540
truly cares for Her Ladyship.

114
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,140
They say even the people of Wei

115
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,580
are proud to have Her Ladyship.

116
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,450
Manman!

117
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,540
Cousin!

118
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,540
Slow down, slow down.

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,410
Be careful.

120
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,900
You're really showing now.

121
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,100
Let me look at you.

122
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,100
You've lost weight.

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
And you've gained weight.

124
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,660
Look at you, so big with child.

125
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,900
Still love to tease me, huh?

126
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,100
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

127
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,730
I could've sent someone to greet you.

128
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,220
It was a rushed trip. I forgot.

129
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,620
Where is Bi Zhi?

130
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,140
He's not home?

131
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Bi Zhi went to patrol the border.

132
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,830
Come,

133
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,700
let's get inside

134
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,560
and have a proper talk.

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,090
Come.

136
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,900
I had someone prepare

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,780
your favorite

138
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,460
orchid-scented wine and cured lamb.

139
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Have a taste. See if it's like you remember.

140
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,300
Cousin,

141
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,370
why isn't Bi Zhi returned yet?

142
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,780
He's usually gone

143
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,050
three to five days,

144
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,340
eight or nine at most.

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,660
He should be back soon.

146
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,290
Stay here and rest easy.

147
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,050
If you need anything, just let me know.

148
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,540
I didn't come

149
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,780
just to visit you.

150
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,250
Do you know that

151
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,050
Liancheng and Yanzhou are under siege?

152
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,050
Bi Zhi mentioned it to me.

153
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,220
His Lordship departed
with the troops before I did.

154
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,530
He should've arrived at Panyi by now.

155
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,980
Lord of Wei is valiant.

156
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,580
He will surely defeat Liangya.

157
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,130
This time is different.

158
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,700
Liu Yan brought 100,000 troops.

159
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,130
To help Liancheng,

160
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,730
His Lordship only took 30,000 to Panyi.

161
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,180
Panyi may have 30,000 garrisoned,

162
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,980
but the gap in strength

163
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,060
is far too great.

164
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,940
Manman,

165
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,180
we are just women.

166
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,730
What can we possibly do?

167
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,060
All we can do is pray

168
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,890
for the safety of Wei State and Yanzhou.

169
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,340
If prayers truly worked,

170
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,580
His Lordship's kin

171
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,420
wouldn't have died in Xindu.

172
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
Manman,

173
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,180
you were right before.

174
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,580
Bi Zhi

175
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,490
really is a man

176
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,460
worth entrusting my life to.

177
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,060
Back in those days,

178
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,610
the two of us lead a wondering life.

179
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,460
That fool

180
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,940
stood guard outside the door all night,

181
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,890
just so I wouldn't be afraid.

182
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,890
Sometimes, just to make sure I ate well,

183
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,060
he'd go work at the docks, doing hard labor.

184
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,460
He always gave me the best he could.

185
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,530
Because of that,

186
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,370
no matter how hard life became,

187
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,820
I never

188
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,890
once regretted choosing him.

189
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,580
Seriously, it's urgent.

190
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,060
Why are you telling me all this now?

191
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,730
When will Bi Zhi return?

192
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,700
Even though we've taken Boya,

193
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,100
I find myself sleepless at night.

194
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,850
Xue Tai and those bandit chiefs

195
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,730
keep stirring up trouble every few days.

196
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,130
He hides it whenever he's hurt,

197
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,700
just so I won't worry.

198
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
There was even a time

199
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
he crossed into Bianzhou by accident,

200
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,460
just to pick sour plums for me.

201
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,010
Xue Tai's men spotted him,
and he got caught in a fight.

202
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,300
He didn't return

203
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,890
for five whole days.

204
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,130
If something had happened to him,

205
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,530
I truly don't know how I would've gone on.

206
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,700
I understand.

207
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,700
The love between you and Bi Zhi is admirable.

208
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,460
But the bond between
His Lordship and me is just as deep.

209
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,340
This time, Liu Yan lays siege
not only to Wei State,

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,420
but to Yanzhou as well.

211
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Do you remember?

212
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,820
When we were young,

213
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,490
Grandfather took us
to Liancheng to build the canal.

214
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,530
The people there welcomed
and loved us deeply.

215
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,220
Now, His Lordship faces a desperate situation

216
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,420
for the people of Liancheng.

217
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,100
Will you just stand by and watch?

218
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,530
It's not that I don't want to help you,

219
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,890
but Boya's forces are limited.

220
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,250
We truly can't offer much support.

221
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,420
Boya has 20,000 troops,

222
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,010
enough to turn the tide!

223
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,220
But Liu Yan commands 100,000!

224
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,100
How can you be so sure

225
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,650
Bi Zhi can win against such odds?

226
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,700
You know it's dangerous up ahead.

227
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,610
Are you going to send him to die?

228
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,300
I don't want him to die.

229
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,580
But, Cousin,

230
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,100
I just received military intel.

231
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,460
Liu Yan's 20,000 reinforcements
are on the way.

232
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,340
They'll reach Wu Marsh in three days,

233
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,700
and arrive at Panyi in five.

234
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
Once his reinforcements arrive,

235
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,730
His Lordship and the people of Panyi

236
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,980
won't stand a chance.

237
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,690
Manman,

238
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,250
you're capable and responsible.

239
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,420
You can save the people of the realm,

240
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,530
but I'm different.

241
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm just an ordinary woman

242
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,490
with no ambition and no grand vision.

243
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,250
Even if I give it my all,

244
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,530
I can only protect one person.

245
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,370
I'm not like you,

246
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,940
who pushes her husband

247
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,890
fight and die

248
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,650
for the Qiao Clan,

249
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,300
and for the people of Yanzhou!

250
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,460
But I...

251
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,100
I can't do it.

252
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,370
So you think

253
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,420
I pushed

254
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,060
my own husband

255
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,340
to fight and die

256
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,010
all for me?

257
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,100
Even you think I'm doing the wrong thing?

258
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,300
You are not.

259
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,770
If I'm not,

260
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,220
then why don't you help me?

261
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,370
Because no one ever said

262
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,300
we must always do what's right, Manman.

263
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,340
I would give my life for you

264
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,340
because you're my dearest cousin.

265
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,890
But I can't let Bi Zhi die for you.

266
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,940
I can't use love as chains

267
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,180
to bind him into fighting for my clan,

268
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,890
not even for you.

269
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,820
Even if it means

270
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,460
you'll hate me,

271
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,820
I will never regret it.

272
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,820
So you've made up your mind

273
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,650
to do nothing about this?

274
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,130
General Bi Zhi.

275
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,940
My Lady.

276
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,530
While patrolling the border,

277
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,130
I saw movement along the way.

278
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
Then I heard of your arrival,

279
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,130
so I returned at once.

280
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,780
Fan,

281
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,180
what's wrong?

282
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,850
Though we're not

283
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,490
sisters by blood, Cousin and I

284
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,820
grew up closer than true siblings.

285
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,460
Now I see you and Bi Zhi in love,

286
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,060
living your own peaceful days,

287
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,250
I'm really happy for you.

288
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Don't worry.

289
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,890
I ask nothing more of you.

290
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,730
My husband is still fighting at the front.

291
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,580
The battle isn't dire yet,
and we're likely to win,

292
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,610
but I shouldn't stay.

293
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,820
I'll take my leave.

294
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,530
Take care.

295
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,340
My Lady.

296
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,580
My Lady, are you alright?

297
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,530
Even Cousin protects Bi Zhi

298
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,060
out of selfishness.

299
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,730
I made His Lordship fight for me.

300
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,580
What am I doing?

301
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,250
My Lady,

302
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,850
it's not your fault.

303
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,850
Please don't cry.

304
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,380
Panyi is hard to breach and easy to defend.

305
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,090
Liu Yan hasn't

306
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,460
taken it yet,

307
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,860
which means he's likely lost many troops.

308
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,050
Tomorrow,

309
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,900
we'll flank them front and back.

310
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,250
Let's end this quickly.

311
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,140
If we act before his reinforcements arrive,

312
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,860
we can secure victory first.

313
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,570
Alright.

314
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,220
Everyone's weary from the march.

315
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,370
Get some rest.

316
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

317
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,980
(Wei)

318
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,220
My Lady,

319
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,860
should I go plead with Lady Fan?

320
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,810
Liu Yan commands 100,000 troops.

321
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,730
We only have 500 to Panyi.

322
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,250
How can we possibly aid
His Lordship like this?

323
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,220
I'm not afraid of danger,

324
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,570
but I worry for you, My Lady.

325
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,980
Once we reach Panyi's border,

326
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,700
you and Chunniang should head back.

327
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,810
I'll take them to there.

328
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Everything's arranged, so don't worry.

329
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,330
My Lady, that's not what I meant.

330
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,180
How could we leave without you?

331
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,250
I know you wouldn't.

332
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,980
But this is between me and His Lordship.

333
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,090
I won't let him

334
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,180
and the troops face this alone.

335
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,900
So I must go,

336
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,660
even if it costs me my life.

337
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,330
But I can't let you

338
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,090
die with me.

339
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,050
But...

340
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,940
It's alright.

341
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
Right here.

342
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,490
I'll build a dam.

343
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,660
Block it with soil,

344
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,810
and the ants will cross safely.

345
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,220
But if I clear the soil away,

346
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,700
the ants will be drown.

347
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,900
You're so mean.

348
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,980
You drowned all the ants!

349
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,700
Chunniang.

350
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,730
Where's my Yanzhou waterway map?

351
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,730
I'll go fetch it.

352
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,900
My Lady, here you are.

353
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,660
(Yanzhou)
His Lordship and Liu Yan

354
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,010
are fighting in the plains outside Panyi.

355
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,490
To siege us, Liu Yan must

356
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,860
circle Mount Cheng to here

357
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,770
and then cross the Wu Marsh.

358
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,860
I promised to guard the rear
for His Lordship,

359
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,900
not a single soldier shall cross Wu Marsh.

360
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,730
My Lady, do you have a plan?

361
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,730
Water flows

362
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,180
from high to low.

363
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,530
With enough force,
it can move boulders downstream.

364
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,290
But when forced uphill,

365
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,380
it slows or stops.

366
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,010
At bends,

367
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,460
it pools and recedes.

368
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,530
(Yanzhou, Yang River, Western Mountain)
When full, it surges forward.

369
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,380
Low ground lets it flow smooth.

370
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,940
High ground restrains it.

371
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,290
Block the bends,

372
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,460
and the current breaks.

373
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,330
In short,

374
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,250
water always seeks the low.

375
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,810
If the waters rise high enough,

376
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,530
the surge can

377
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,730
sweep away the stones.

378
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,770
We don't have the numbers

379
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,380
for a direct fight.

380
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,860
But if we use the terrain,

381
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,220
we might win with fewer troops.

382
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
But how exactly?

383
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,490
Grandfather once said,

384
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,700
to lower the water level,

385
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,620
block it upstream

386
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,250
or drain it downstream.

387
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,380
There is an upstream.

388
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,420
Wu Marsh is fed by the Yang River.

389
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,090
If we dam the junction

390
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,330
and block the Yang River,

391
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,220
the water level in Wu Marsh will drop.

392
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,250
Then we'll break the dam,

393
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,530
let Yang River

394
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,380
flood in,

395
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,620
and unleash a deadly surge.

396
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,420
By then, Liangya's troops will be like ants.

397
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,940
We overturn the soil,

398
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,980
and they scatter.

399
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,010
This way,

400
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,050
whether it's 20,000 or 100,000,

401
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,330
they'll all perish here.

402
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,420
Then let's go block the upstream.

403
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,330
How long to build a sand dam?

404
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,010
At best, a few days.
At worst, half a month.

405
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,730
Not enough time, My Lady.

406
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,330
Not enough time...

407
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,940
To manage water,

408
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,980
(Yanzhou)
one must move with its changes.

409
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,380
Clear its path.

410
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,730
Guide its flow.

411
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,730
Such is the way of both water and men.

412
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,530
We must adapt to change,

413
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,920
and find fulfillment
through each winding turn.

414
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,150
That too is wisdom.

415
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,050
We won't block the upstream.

416
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,810
We'll drain the downstream.

417
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,420
I remember Grandfather

418
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,900
once built a reservoir here.

419
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,810
We'll store the waters of Wu Marsh there,

420
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,660
(Wu Marsh)
lower the water level,

421
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,250
and make a fool of them.

422
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,420
My Lady, you never planned
to win with fewer troops.

423
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,570
You never planned to fight at all.

424
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,980
I have no other choice.

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,660
We still have 20,000 reinforcements
on the way.

448
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,420
Whoever brings back Wei Shao's head,

449
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,660
shall be named General of the Cavalry Guard!

450
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,620
Great!

451
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,530
Seize Wei Shao!

452
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,050
Strike!

453
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,810
All warriors,

454
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,180
twenty li from here,

455
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,940
on the plains outside Panyi City,

456
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,660
our Wei warriors are locked in fierce battle.

457
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,140
Though we haven't fought head-on,

458
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,180
if all goes as planned,

459
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,900
we may yet to turn the tide for Wei State.

460
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,810
You are the guards of Lord of Wei's mansion,

461
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,940
the finest warriors of the Wei State.

462
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
But now,

463
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,010
I must ask you to risk your lives,

464
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,460
and stake everything alongside me.

465
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,940
We follow your command, My Lady!

466
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,420
All warriors, heed my order.

467
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,860
Squad One and Squad Two,

468
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,570
cross the river to
the upper reaches of Wu Marsh.

469
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,660
Squad One, set up sulfur and rocks

470
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,330
along the path. Make it look like

471
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,180
we're preparing to dam and break the banks.

472
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,330
Squad Two, catch the wild birds.

473
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,330
Release them
once Liangya's reinforcements arrive.

474
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,140
They'll believe a large ambush
awaits them upstream.

475
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,730
The rest stay here with me,

476
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,460
lay out the sulfur

477
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,090
and open the reservoir.

478
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,140
Yes!

479
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,380
Squad One, follow me!

480
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,530
Squad Two, follow me!

481
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,530
Reporting!

482
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,870
My Lord,

483
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,900
Liu Shan, Liangya's Deputy,

484
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,030
led 5,000 armored cavalry

485
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,050
in a left-flank assault.

486
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,420
We've lost many cavalry.

487
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,770
Pass my command.

488
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,730
Crossbow units, prepare!

489
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,930
Yes.

490
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,700
Reporting, My Lord.

491
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,700
Liangya forces are pressing hard.

492
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,570
Our front lines

493
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,810
are sustaining heavy casualties.

494
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,420
Have the cavalry cover the retreat.

495
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,860
All troops fall back five li
and await orders.

496
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,700
Yes.

497
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,900
Reporting!

498
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,490
An urgent message from Panyi City.

499
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,660
The West Gate is weakly defended.

500
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,010
They request reinforcements.

501
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,940
By now,

502
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,620
Her Ladyship should've secured reinforcements

503
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,900
and be on her way from Boya to hold Wu Marsh.

504
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,330
I believe she'll come.

505
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,290
Be careful.

506
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,380
Here.

507
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,700
Alright, harder.

508
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,130
- Come on.
- Hold it tight.

509
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,060
My Lady,

510
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,420
though we're short-handed,

511
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,180
you don't have to do this yourself.

512
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,810
It pains me to see this.

513
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,850
I'm fine.

514
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,860
- Let me carry it.
- No need.

515
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,180
Chunniang, take the firewood.

516
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,020
Yes.

517
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,570
Move quickly.

518
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

519
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,710
My Lady,

520
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,730
Liangya's reinforcements will reach
Wu Marsh tomorrow.

521
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,020
Good.

522
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,900
My Lady,

523
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,180
everything is ready.

524
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,860
Light it!

525
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,570
We did it!

526
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,330
We did it!

527
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,730
By tomorrow morning,

528
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,250
the reservoir will be full.

529
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,140
Hurry and tidy up.

530
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,460
We're heading to Wu Marsh Ferry.

531
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,050
Tomorrow,

532
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,330
we'll strike from three fronts.

533
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,400
Wei Qu, you'll go with me.

534
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,380
We'll attack head-on

535
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,290
in a fish-scale,

536
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,140
trapezoid formation.

537
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,130
Yes.

538
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,220
My Lord.

539
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,660
The Wu Marsh water level is dropping rapidly.

540
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,140
Why is this happening?

541
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,860
No cause found yet.

542
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,660
Could the Liangya troops be trying

543
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,620
to cross the river?

544
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,010
If they plan to cross,

545
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,050
we must drive them back before

546
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,900
reinforcements arrive.

547
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,700
Pass my orders.

548
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,530
We ride out to battle at Yin hour tomorrow.

549
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,610
Fan,

551
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,610
I'm back.

552
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Fan?

553
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,490
Fan, what's wrong?

554
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,900
Is the baby giving you trouble?

555
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,460
No.

556
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,570
I was thinking of Manman.

557
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,380
When Her Ladyship left,

558
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,940
she was escorted by Wei guards.

559
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,420
You really don't need to worry.

560
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,220
By now,

561
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,290
she should have returned to Yujun.

562
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,450
Panyi is at war now.

563
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,490
Before Her Ladyship departed,

564
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,980
she told me to guard Boya well.

565
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,180
Otherwise,

566
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,050
I'd have escorted her back for you.

567
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,730
All warriors, heed my order!

568
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,420
The people of Panyi City,

569
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,570
whether from Yanzhou

570
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,860
or Wei State,

571
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,860
do not deserve this suffering.

572
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,460
The innocent of this land
deserve none of this.

573
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,290
Now that we are here,

574
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,770
we must defend Panyi at all costs.

575
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,180
For this battle,

576
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,220
we must win,

577
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,490
not lose!

578
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,620
We fight to the last breath!

579
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:45,660
Fight to the last breath!

580
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,500
Move out!

581
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,340
(Liancheng, Yanzhou)
Charge!

582
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,330
(Qiao)
Charge!

583
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,140
(Border of Panyi, Wei State)

584
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,820
(General Lin, from Liangya State)

585
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,620
Soldiers, check the water.

586
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,460
Yes.

587
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,220
General, there's someone across the river.

588
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,620
It's Lady Qiao, wife of the Lord of Wei,

589
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,660
the Lady of Wei State.

590
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,730
She stands there alone.

591
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,810
Capturing her

592
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,940
will earn us great merit.

593
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,700
- Soldiers!
- Yes.

594
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,540
Prepare to cross.

595
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,530
Seize Lady Qiao!

596
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,570
Follow me to slay Liu Yan! Hyah!

597
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,620

Reporting!

624
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,970
What is it?

625
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,210
My Lord,

626
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,570
over half our troops

627
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,650
have fallen.

628
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,380
You losers!

629
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,700
My Lord!

630
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,260
You're just in time.

631
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,530
Are the reinforcements here?

632
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,440
My Lord,

633
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,780
the reinforcements can't make it.

634
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,050
General Lin sent word.

635
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,380
They encountered Wei forces at Wu Marsh

636
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,260
and suffered a defeat.

637
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,260
They had to pull back.

638
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,170
What?

639
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,220
My Lord,

640
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,260
we're under attack

641
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,570
on all fronts.

642
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,650
Our men can't hold the line.

643
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,490
We must retreat.

644
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,140
My Lord,

645
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,130
withdraw the troops.

646
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,300
My Lord!

647
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,970
Let's go.

648
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,490
Back to Liangya!

649
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,260
Withdraw!

650
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,650
Back to Liangya!

651
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:58,300
Stop the pursuit!

652
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,050
Stop the pursuit!

653
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,210
Congratulations, My Lord.
That's a total victory!

654
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,690
Our warriors fought bravely.

655
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,530
My Lord,

656
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,980
this is a hard-won battle.

657
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,650
We split many forces

658
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,090
to Liancheng and Xiaogang,

659
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,570
leaving only a few here against Liu Yan.

660
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,610
It was tough.

661
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,260
Indeed.

662
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,420
Clear up the battlefield!

663
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,490
Yes!

664
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,980
My Lord.

665
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,210
Thankfully, Her Ladyship kept her word.

666
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,010
She brought reinforcements

667
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,490
from Boya.

668
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,130
They crushed 20,000
of Liangya's reinforcements

669
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,650
at Wu Marsh.

670
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,780
They won us the chance.

671
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,340
It truly is a fine opportunity.

672
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,210
However,

673
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,420
all it really did

674
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,860
was protect Yanzhou's interests.

675
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:48,850
My Lord,

676
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,210
though the Boya reinforcements came late,

677
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,650
they still made a difference.

678
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,650
Her Ladyship must

679
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,380
care about you.

680
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,860
She cares about what?

681
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
I've been away this long.

682
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,650
She didn't send me a letter.

683
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,130
Anyone would think

684
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,170
she's been so occupied in Yujun,
she found no time

685
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,690
to send a letter.

686
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,380
I'll settle this with her when I'm back.

687
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,170
Tell our men to rest.

688
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,690
We'll march to aid Liancheng later.

689
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,980
- Yes.
- My Lord,

690
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,260
we found a boat lantern in the river.

691
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,340
No wonder

692
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,940
the battle turned so quickly.

693
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,900
Her Ladyship must have

694
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,170
led Boya's reinforcements herself.

695
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,460
- We should...
- I'll go bring her back.

696
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,620
Hyah!

697
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
My Lord!

698
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,260
Hyah!

699
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,850
Hyah!

700
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,140
My Lord!

701
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,380
My Lord!

702
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,280
My Lord,

703
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,010
we've reclaimed Liancheng and Xiaogang.

704
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,980
We came to join forces.

705
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,300
Thanks to you, My Lord,

706
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,300
for holding off Liu Yan
and his reinforcements.

707
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,740
And General Wei Liang

708
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,490
brought most of the troops to Liancheng.

709
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,460
That's how we won so swiftly.

710
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,780
I appreciate it, My Lord.

711
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,740
You should thank your sister.

712
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,180
(Wei)

713
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,490
I'm not into this.

714
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,170
Sincerity brings miracles.

715
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,420
(Wei)

716
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,860
My Lord,

717
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,130
there's no need to worry.

718
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,090
Once the warriors are ready,

719
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,490
we'll set out and meet

720
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,570
Her Ladyship together.

721
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,900
Who says I'm thinking about her?

722
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,860
I'm just wondering

723
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,820
does Liu Yan still have a backup plan?

724
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,900
No, he does not.

725
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,010
For this battle,

726
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,650
Liu Yan was soundly defeated.

727
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,780
We won against the odds,

728
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
first, thanks to your skill and courage

729
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,090
in leading the troops;

730
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,900
second,

731
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,130
due to Her Ladyship's great contribution.

732
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,210
She drove off the reinforcements
from Wu Marsh to Panyi,

733
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,980
cutting off Liu Yan's support.

734
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,690
If not for that,

735
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,260
who knows how many would have fallen?

736
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,300
Because of this,

737
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,530
even as Advisor,

738
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,860
I feel ashamed.

739
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,130
Of course,

740
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,820
Manman is the smartest.

741
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,300
Smart?

742
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,860
She's just got a bit of wit.

743
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,690
Xiaotao told me to go to Liancheng,

744
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,090
saying Manman went to Boya

745
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,340
to seek reinforcements for you.

746
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,460
I thought she was bluffing.

747
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,940
Manman and His Lordship

748

750
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,170
Young Master Ci to help me for my sake.

751

Her Ladyship is even more
thoughtful and loyal.

Thoughtful and loyal? You say?

758
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,050
She only cares about her Yanzhou.
