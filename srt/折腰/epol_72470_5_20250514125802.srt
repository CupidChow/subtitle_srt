00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I failed to see my grandfather for the last time.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yu Lang, I'll go pack up now.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go back to the army now.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll go now to make up for the old woman's wish.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I can't go back to Qingwei City.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Master, I'll send out the bandits in the future.

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now that the bandits are dead,

18
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
how can you watch us conquer Yanzhou?

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
General Zhongwei, listen to me.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't always remember the hatred.

21
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to move the situation to change the situation.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What does Yanzhou mean by sending the report at this time?

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Isn't it just to make the female laborer's birthday?

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Can't you get married?

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pan Yicheng, Xiuqu, don't you want to buy these things?

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What is the Qiao family doing?

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know about this.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Master, Zhang Peng doesn't have a family.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It doesn't matter.

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I believe you've seen the letter.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Everyone says that the marriage can't be done.

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I just want to ask you one thing.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is it a family or not?

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I know what the Qiao family is doing.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But I don't know what the Qiao family is doing.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This marriage is what my grandfather wanted.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't think he'll blame me for this marriage.

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't know what the Qiao family is doing.

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But I just want to ask you one thing.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is it a family or not?

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't know.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I just thought I might let I go.

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,020
Do you really superイulang?

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
Then get too close,

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,920
And get away.

59
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,160
Get close again.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,940
How do you know Congratulations?

61
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,820
Hey,you!!

62
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,260
You are so cold.

63
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,060
Listen to me,

64
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,000
If you are not fighting for the mission of 준�ule,

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
You're not going to succeed.

66
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,960
Jingan.

67
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,900
Jingan.

68
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,440
Jingan.

69
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,960
Jing...

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,340
Jing...

71
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,320
Just one day after today

72
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,400
you'll be delivering Boris's men's remains

73
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,840
at the village's fi keys store.

74
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,280
The Chaparritashanica,

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,620
the Auld Lang Syneaphobe has forgotten

76
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,420
essa sought carnally.

77
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,540
Elixir.

78
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm the most annoying when I'm not silent

79
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,900
But everyone is so obsessed with me

80
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,780
I really can't figure out what this man is thinking

81
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,660
He was hiding around a few days ago

82
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,300
and didn't want to get married

83
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,740
Now he's fine

84
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,540
He doesn't want to be the one at all

85
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,420
You won't blame me, right?

86
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm sorry

87
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
I'm sorry

88
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
I'm sorry

89
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm sorry

90
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
I'm sorry

91
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
I'm sorry

92
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I'm sorry

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm sorry

94
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540

I'm sorry

99
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm sorry

100
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
I'm sorry

101
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm sorry

102
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
I'm sorry

103
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
I'm sorry

104
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
I'm sorry

105
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
I'm sorry

106
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm sorry

107
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,540
I'm sorry

108
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm sorry

109
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm sorry

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm sorry

111
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
I'm sorry

112
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm sorry

113
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
I'm sorry

114
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
I'm sorry

115
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,540
Fire

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Ocean

117
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
It's Division 1

118
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
What could it be?

119
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:36,540
Fire

120
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,440
Yansin

121
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,540
Ememura

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Erlang

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,720
In the future you need to be alone

124
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,160
You must bury the true hope.

125
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,580
Master...

126
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,420
Red

127
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,980
Blue

128
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,580
Green

129
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,340
Still red

130
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,340
seem to sit with my stage tomorrow.

131
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,260
Thanks for the meal.

132
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,780
Have some soup.

133
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,600
This test is for

134
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,780

135
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
Just forward the ser bust.

136
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,160
Box divide it up.

137
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,980
We will wear it on our table

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,480
as miracle-like version.

139
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,000
This kind of peff Blade.

140
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,200
He domain control,

141
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,040
You Espa.

142
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,880
What are you?

143
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
What are you?

144
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Li Yuzheng

145
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Li Yuzheng

146
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Li Yuzheng

147
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,360
This thief Qiao died too cheaply

148
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Today is the day of the master's wedding

149
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Yes, today is the day of the wedding

150
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Don't think about that

151
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Come and drink

152
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Drink

153
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360

154
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Come and drink

155
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Drink

156
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Come on

157
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Hello

158
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
From today

159
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
I should miss Nanjun

160
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
You should get rid of these

161
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
You are tired today

162
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Go to bed early

163
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
From today

164
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
You and I are husband and wife

165
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
From now on

166
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
No matter what I do to the Qiao family

167
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
No matter what I do to the Yan State

168
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
I won't hurt you

169
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,360
And I won't let you have no place to hide

170
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Thank you Nanjun

171
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
But I only have one request

172
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
From now on

173
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,360
You can only be the husband and wife

174
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
I am no longer the Qiao family

175
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
No

176
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Come on

177
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Now the marriage has been done

178
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
The marriage has been decided

179
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Since Nanjun has made this promise

180
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Li Jun can be his wife

181
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
He is not a bad person

182
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
But I will always be the daughter of the Qiao family

183
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I will always think for the Qiao family

184
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
This is an irreversible fact

185
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Li Jun, watch the good news

186
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
In a few days

187
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
You will go with Nanjun to Yujin

188
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
I will go with Nanjun to Yujin

189
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
I will go with Nanjun to Yujin

190
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
When we are in the land of Wei

191
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,180
We can't be the

192
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,360
Sages of the Qiao family

193
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Here

194
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Here

195
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Li Jun, are you cold?

196
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
I will go to get some hot water

197
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
I will let you take it

198
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Take the umbrella

199
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
I am fine

200
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Xiao Tao

201
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Take the umbrella

202
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
You are a kid

203
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Li Jun

204
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,360
The cold rain will hurt you

205
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
It will affect your wound

206
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
You have been out for so long

207
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
You can understand the anxiety

208
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
When you get home

209
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
You can understand the anxiety

210
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
When you get home

211
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
You can understand the anxiety

212
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
When you get to Yujin

213
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
You can take a shower

214
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I don't know yet

215
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
What is the situation in Yujin

216
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I don't know yet

217
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Get in the car

218
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
On the way

219
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
The snake is on the road

220
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
The earth is covered with mud

221
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
There will be a storm in two days

222
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
There are many swamps ahead

223
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
It's too dangerous to wear a raincoat

224
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
We have been waiting for a few days

225
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:58,320
Since we attacked the

226
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Are you grateful or waiting for Yujin

227
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Keep going

228
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Soldiers, ready to go

229
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Yes

230
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
What?

231
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Put it down

232
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Thank you, General Wei

233
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Wait a minute

234
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
I saved your life on the beach

235
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Just this attitude

236
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
What's wrong with my attitude

237
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
The men's army has been equaled with the women's army

238
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
You are still here

239
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Tianjin is still here

240
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Ask for mercy

241
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Women and men have stopped fighting

242
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
You are the fierce one all day

243
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Why?

244
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Am I fierce

245
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
No

246
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Wait a minute

247
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
The master ordered to hurry up

248
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
It takes too much time to fight

249
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Do you make sense

250
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
It's so cold

251
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
What's wrong with me to get some hot water

252
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
A few days later

253
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,360
It's the ritual of General Wei

254
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Because you hit water

255
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
It's appropriate to delay the journey

256
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
How long can I waste water

257
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Just delay the journey

258
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Are you okay, Zhao Fan

259
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
It's on the road

260
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
Yes

261
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Do you hear me

262
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
No

263
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
You're upset

264
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Please

265
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,380
Don't mention it

266
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,440
I can't

267
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,080
ions

268
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,260
I just couldn't

269
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,740
smooth

270
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,520
Kun roughly

271
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,860
Да

272
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,600
ocused

273
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:07,980
Really

274
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,000
To crack open a way in which

275
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,540
one cannot have escaped death

276
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,160
As the urban

277
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,240
Gods in closing

278
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,920
monastery

279
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:33,460
drum

280
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,940
benefit

281
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,180
To the point

282
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,460
She didn't even come here.

283
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,700
She did it on purpose.

284
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,980
Isn't Qiao Nu going to enter the city with you?

285
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,540
I've left her outside the city.

286
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,740
But after the ceremony,

287
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
I'll have to ask my cousin to bring her back.

288
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,140
Wei Liang, Wei Xiao, Wei Qu, Wei Duo,

289
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,860
you stay here.

290
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
The rest of you, go into the city.

291
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,820
Yes.

292
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,460
Thank you for your hard work, General.

293
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,660
I used to hear a lot about this idea.

294
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,420
Zhanglian is back to join the tribes.

295
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,700
He's making lots of progress.

296
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,820
He recently intelligence company

297
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,700
threw a landslide YouTubers channel.

298
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,820
Not many people know about it.

299
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,380
Why are they going after Maちi other than the ambassador?

300
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,580
It's перекl

301
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,740
W bare!

302
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,420
what are you going to do if I go?

303
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,380
Do you really sorry for it?

304
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm willing to accept it.

305
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,220
Don't!

306
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,060
Stop!

307
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,180
Why did you just leave

308
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,260
our Women facilities

309
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,420
out in the desert?

310
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,620
He thought för he took us back to the 一 holiday

311
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,780
to extend the message among us.

312
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,660
When he demanded a ending for us,

313
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,500
we agreed.

314
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,340
This happened

315
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,140
as a symbol of an underling.

316
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,740
It's not suitable for us to stay here.

317
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,220
Li Ying is staying outside the city.

318
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,420
Spare me.

319
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,140
Spare me.

320
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,460
How physics can we...

321
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,140
ground up our Ch голов?

322
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
We don't even have much space.

323
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,540
Do we have to use the board?

324
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,180
I may climb a little bit high.

325
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,460
Just why you...

326
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,140
You're dead.

327
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
A child who cries when he sees blood

328
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
How to lead the army in the future

329
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
When can the blood of Wei be avenged

330
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
That's right. The child sees blood and cries

331
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
How can I avenge the child in the future

332
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Son

333
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Yes, what's wrong with him

334
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,140
When can the blood of the blood be avenged

335
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Mrs. Xu is here

336
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Have you had enough

337
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,140
We pay respect to Mrs. Xu

338
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Although Wei Shao is very old

339
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,140
He will inherit the family

340
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,140
I pay respect to the Master

341
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,140
Pay respect to the Master

342
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
Everyone, make a pledge to the God

343
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Zhu Li Su destroy the Qiang State

344
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Zhu Li Su destroy the Qiang State

345
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Zhu Li Su destroy the Qiang State

346
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Zhu Li Su destroy the Qiang State

347
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Please

348
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
Stop

349
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Lord Bo, Lord Bo

350
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,140
Why did you leave me early

351
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
These years

352
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,140
I didn't think about revenge for you

353
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,140
One day I avenged the blood

354
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,140
I went to the underground to make a promise with you

355
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
But today Zhong Lin

356
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,140
I have to marry the enemy woman

357
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,140
I have no face to see you

358
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
I was the one who took the Qiao family

359
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
It has nothing to do with Zhong Lin

360
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
It's okay to get married

361
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
But Zhong Lin

362
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,140
You didn't kill that Qiao Zui yourself

363
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,140
And let him earn money

364
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Come, take the food and rest

365
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
In case you feel sad

366
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Wait

367
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
Mrs. Zhu is right

368
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,140
Why doesn't Mrs. Zhu finish her words

369
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Lord Bo, you are late again

370
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
The Han Dynasty is complicated

371
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
So I'm late

372
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,140
I believe the old man will not blame you

373
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,140
His niece married the daughter of the enemy

374
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,140
You let him be the emperor

375
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't forget who shouted that year

376
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Zhu Li Su destroyed the Qiang family

377
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,140
General, the master has taken back Xin Du

378
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
The first Li Su

379
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
So what

380
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,140
The Qiang family is more ruthless than Li Su

381
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Lord Bo

382
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
Don't forget the man in Xin Du

383
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
You saw his miserable state

384
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
But now

385
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
You married the daughter of the enemy

386
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,140
How do you want the old man to live

387
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Look back

388
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Who is here

389
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
The father, the brother, the son

390
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
The position of the Wei State

391
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:45,980
The young people in Yan State are never

392
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
What

393
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
The seal of the plate

394
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,140
This plate is the door of the Yan State

395
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
The master married the Qiao family

396
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Not a soldier can get the plate

397
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,140
After that, the door of the Yan State is open

398
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,140
In the future, it is like a charcoal basket to take the item

399
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
It's not a waste of the power to blow it back

400
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Well said

401
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Since you got the plate

402
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,140
Why don't you take the opportunity to take the iron

403
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,140
Where is Kang Jun

404
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Uncle Hang asked me this

405
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
I want to ask you

406
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
You are the leader of the Han army

407
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
After I took over Xin Du

408
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Immediately, the Bai Li family arrived

409
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Ask you to help me

410
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,140
But I waited in Xin Du for a few days

411
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,140
Accompanying the reinforcements to escape

412
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
I have to do something

413
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
You can't talk nonsense

414
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Everyone, I didn't receive a letter of letter

415
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Otherwise, it's impossible not to go to Chiyuan

416
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,140
OK

417
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
I will find out this

418
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
I am a soldier this time

419
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Just to complete the last wish of the headquarters

420
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Repair the Yongning District

421
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
Reconstruct the people

422
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
I have never forgotten the blood of the two families of Qiao Wei

423
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
Just that I can wait for 14 years

424
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Naturally, I can wait another 10 years

425
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
It's too much

426
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
It's raining so hard

427
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Let men come here

428
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
They said they wouldn't let the female army enter the city

429
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
Didn't you say you wouldn't let the female soldiers enter?

430
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
I'll find them

431
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,140
Don't be impulsive

432
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,140
We are too sensible

433
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Just here

434
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,140
When did the female army suffer this kind of grievance

435
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
I'm sorry

436
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm sorry

437
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm sorry

438
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,140
I'm sorry

439
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
The male army hasn't come to pick us up

440
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
It should be that it hasn't been handled properly

441
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
The relationship between the two tribes has not been fully resolved

442
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,140
I suffered this grievance

443
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
I've thought about it a long time ago

444
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
It will be more difficult to marry back

445
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
I didn't expect it to be so difficult

446
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,140
This is not good

447
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,140
Let's go down and hang the rain cloth

448
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Go

449
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Take an umbrella

450
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Let's go

451
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Harder

452
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Let go

453
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,140
I'll help you

454
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
Come on

455
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Harder

456
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
Harder

457
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
You can't pull the umbrella

458
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Come on, hard

459
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Let go

460
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Come on, one, two

461
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Harder

462
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
Don't let go

463
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
One, two, three

464
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
This way

465
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
Duoer, go get a torch

466
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
You sweep the floor

467
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
I go

468
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
Okay, okay, okay

469
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
Okay, okay, okay

470
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

471
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,140
You put that in the middle

472
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Over there

473
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
I'll come over

474
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Don't let go

475
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Okay

476
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140
The moon shines like a deep sea

477
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
But it's dark

478
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,140
How lucky to light up the dream

479
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
And admit

480
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
No, I'll go out and ask

481
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Before I pass

482
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
A small light shines on the dream

483
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
But it's dark

484
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
How lucky to light up the dream

485
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,140
And admit

486
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
No, I'll go out and ask

487
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Before I pass

488
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
A small light shines on the dream

489
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,140
But it's dark

490
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
The moon shines like a deep sea

491
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
But it's dark

492
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,720
Withering in the fire

493
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,000
We are clocked under pavilion

494
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,180
The night

495
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,780
The fourth boor

496
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,660
How can I forget

497
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,420
I'm willing to put on the cap for you

498
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,660
With refueling adapter

499
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,740
Visiting you the Bright rése

500
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,780
Draw all your petals

501
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:24,140
TO

502
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,060
This Japanese throw us away from title Xindu

503
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,060
What does it mean?

504
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,120
less than throwing us to the arrangement

505
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:51,880
At least it's a little close to the

506
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
You're here to take the women's army to the city?

507
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
We're here to send you to Yanzhou.

508
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
To Yanzhou?

509
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
Yes.

510
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
What are you talking about?

511
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Whose life are you taking?

512
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Our women's army and men's army are now a couple.

513
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Now, it's a fair and just military army.

514
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Now, it's not.

515
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Hurry up.

516
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Be quick.

517
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
You're so rude.

518
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Be careful.

519
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Get down.

520
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Get down.

521
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
What are you doing?

522
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Get down.

523
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Get down.

524
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
What are you doing?

525
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Get down.

526
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,160
If you can't take the women's army in the

527
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,140
clothes of the main force,

528
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
you won't be able to take the women's army in the army.

529
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Don't touch me.

530
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
You're being so rude.

531
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Get down.

532
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
What are you doing?

533
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Don't touch me.

534
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
We're here to send you to the city.

535
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
We're here to send you to the city.

536
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Wei Liang, you go to the city and ask the main force to come here.

537
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Get down.

538
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
What are you doing?

539
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,140
General Wei Liang and General Wei Liang are asking for an audience.

540
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,140
They have urgent news.

541
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
Why is Wei Liang outside the city?

542
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
I forgot.

543
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,140
These days, General Wei Liang is still outside the city to take care of the women's army.

544
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,140
I heard that the women's army has been sick for several days

545
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
after the storm and stormy rain.

546
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
The ceremony has been completed for two days.

547
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Why didn't anyone invite them in?

548
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,140
I don't know.

549
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Cousin,

550
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I have something to report to you.

551
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Something big happened suddenly.

552
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
I came here to break the rules.

553
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
Please don't blame me.

554
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
Say it.

555
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
A few days ago,

556
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,140
Cousin ordered me to take you to the mansion.

557
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,140
I was prepared.

558
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
I was not.

559
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,140
But I have another plan for this.

560
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
I love my son.

561
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,140
I think for Cousin no matter what.

562
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,140
I just do what you want.

563
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,140
But I think this is not necessarily my intention.

564
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,140
So I should tell Cousin

565
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
to be relieved.

566
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
What do you want to say?

567
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,140
I'm afraid that you will confuse people's hearts

568
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
and harm Cousin.

569
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,140
The moneyman sent a divorce letter to Qiao Ni.

570
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,140
What?

571
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Please don't blame me.

572
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,140
Nonsense.

573
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
What are you doing?

574
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Get out of the way.

575
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
What are you doing?

576
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Help me.

577
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Stop.

578
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Stop.

579
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
Stop.

580
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Li Jun.

581
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Li Jun.

582
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Say something to Zhiniang.

583
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Say something to Zhiniang.

584
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Stop.

585
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
General.

586
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Please.

587
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Please.

588
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,140
General.

589
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
General.

590
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
General.

591
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Hurry up.

592
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
Hurry up.

593
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,140
Li Jun.

594
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Here.

595
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
General.

596
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Please.

597
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Please ask Nan Jun again.

598
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,140
There must be some misunderstanding.

599
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Why did Nan Jun drive her away?

600
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Please.

601
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Don't do this.

602
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Get up.

603
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Please.

604
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Please.

605
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Enough.

606
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
You usually don't treat us well.

607
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Why are you doing this?

608
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Li Liang has already reported to the master.

609
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
There is no action.

610
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
I'm afraid that the master has already given up.

611
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,140
I was the one who was crazy before.

612
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
You can punish me however you want.

613
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,140
But your father didn't harm you.

614
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
He was already injured.

615
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Now he has a high fever.

616
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
He has a high fever.

617
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
If you keep touching him,

618
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
you will die.

619
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Right?

620
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
You are wrong.

621
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
In order to help you,

622
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
he injured his arm.

623
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,140
He hasn't recovered yet.

624
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
You are not kind.

625
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
Nan Jun is so heartless.

626
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,140
He wants to save you.

627
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
You can't kill him.

628
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Hurry up.

629
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Go.

630
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Hurry up.

631
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Go.

632
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
No.

633
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,140
No.

634
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,140
You can't run.

635
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,140
Go.

636
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
Hurry up.

637
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Don't run.

638
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
You can't run.

639
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Go.

640
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
What should we do?

641
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
At most, we should send a squad to go there.

642
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
It's a big deal.

643
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
At least 40 squads.

644
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Then...

645
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Don't go.

646
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
Get out of my way.

647
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Don't go.

648
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
You can't go.

649
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
You can't go.

650
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
I will find you.

651
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
I will find you.

652
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
Go away.

653
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
Stop the car.

654
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
Go.

655
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
Go.

656
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Zhuo.

657
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Who told you to come?

658
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,140
It's Mrs. Zhu.

659
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
Come here.

660
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Yes.

661
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Nan Jun.

662
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Your wound is very serious.

663
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Please save your mother.

664
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Please, Nan Jun.

665
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
Go.

666
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
Go.
