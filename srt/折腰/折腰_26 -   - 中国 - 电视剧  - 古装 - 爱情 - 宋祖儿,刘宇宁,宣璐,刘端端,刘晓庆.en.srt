=The Prisoner of Beauty=

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 26=

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,650
Back then,

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,900
I was forced to marry Chen Xiang.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,700
It was the same situation.

33
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,290
I was too young then

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,210
to decide for myself.

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,490
But now,

36
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,340
I no longer wish

37
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,260
to be a puppet used for gain.

38
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,900
For the sake of Bogong,

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,340
Zhonglin,

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,580
may I stay in Yujun for a while

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,300
to hide away?

42
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,300
Why are you asking me?

43
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,020
Is it because you feel

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,340
something is not right

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,540
but can't quite tell what?

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,540
Last time she came to Yujun,

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,660
she had a falling-out with you over Ci.

48
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,740
So keeping her here

49
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,020
is indeed not right.

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,860
But she is the one

51
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,540
your brother entrusted you to care for.

52
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,100
If you turn her away,

53
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,060
you won't feel right about it.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,780
Shall I find her

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,460
another place to stay?

56
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,300
No need for that.

57
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,980
Just have her stay at the post house.

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
Alright, I'll go to work.

59
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,700
Why do you want to
let Lady Yulou stay, My Lady?

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,260
Perhaps I feel the same as His Lordship

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,500
that something isn't right,

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,220
but I can't quite tell what is it.

63
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,940
Ehuang.

64
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,780
I drew out a maid from the Wei Mansion

65
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,020
and, with a hint of flirtation,
got her to open up.

66
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,340
Outwardly, the Lord of Wei
accepted Lady Qiao,

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,380
but they never consummated the marriage.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,140
Really?

69
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,700
They say

70
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,340
it's a mourning for Qiao Gui.

71
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,260
Wei Shao?

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,140
Mourning for Qiao Gui?

73
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,940
Few men can resist beauty.

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,740
That so-called mourning

75
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,100
is just for show.

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,260
If they got married

77
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,900
but never consummated it,

78
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,100
maybe they don't love each other.

79
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,220
I've found a few fine books.

80
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Go invite the Lord of Wei

81
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,820
for a word.

82
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,980
Yes, Ehuang.

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,700
Lord of Wei.

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,180
Lady Yulou, you called me here
so late at night.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
May I ask the reason?

86
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,980
I heard you've been troubled

87
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,900
by the Yongning Canal.

88
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,500
I thought,

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,780
perhaps I could help in some way.

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,940
How can you help, Lady Yulou?

91
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,540
At the Deer Hunt,

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,900
you promised

93
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,540
to provide 100,000 elite troops
to help dig the canal.

94
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,700
I know you're righteous,

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,180
but I admire

96
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,420
Her Ladyship even more.

97
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,660
I heard she, too, made great

98
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,900
contributions to the canal.

99
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,020
So I thought

100
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,340
maybe I could help, in my own way.

101
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,580
These past few days,

102
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,020
I've spent quite a bit of money

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,900
to have people find some ancient texts

104
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,820
on advanced

105
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,420
water management.

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,140
I thought Lady Qiao

107
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,060
might find them useful.

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,060
Perhaps I've read them so often

109
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,380
that they carry my scent.

110
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,140
I've even added my notes.

111
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,180
Thank you, Lady Yulou.

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,100
I only skimmed through them.

113
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,980
I still can't quite understand

114
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,620
some parts.

115
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,620
"Book of Canals", for example,

116
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,060
covers the history of hydrology.

117
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,780
Many river names

118
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,580
are hard to recognize.

119
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,900
The annotations are complex,

120
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,300
not something learned in a day.

121
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,900
How about this?

122
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,500
I'll take it back

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,940
and study it with Her Ladyship.

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
Thank you, Lady Yulou.

125
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,620
My Lord.

126
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,120
Where is Her Ladyship?

127
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,980
My Lord,

128
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,420
Her Ladyship went to freshen up.

129
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
She'll be right back.

130
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,100
Put this away.

131
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,180
Yes.

132
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,380
You're back, My Lord.

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
What's this?

134
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,820
Texts on water management,

135
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
from Lady Yulou.

136
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,580
Hope you'll find them useful.

137
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,580
(Geography Book)

138
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,740
My Lady, Master Zhenshi
requests to see you outside.

139
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,300
Didn't he go to Yunzhong

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,060
to see the Moya Inscriptions?

141
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,340
He's back so soon?

142
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,420
I went to view

143
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,020
the Moya Inscriptions in Yunzhong

144
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,380
at the arrangement of the Lord of Wei.

145
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,060
Please, My Lady.

146
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,340
I've brought you

147
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,500
a small gift.

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,460
I hope you'll like it

149
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,620
and not mind,

150
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,900
My Lady.

151
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,500
Here.

152
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,900
(Poetic Exposition of Dongdu)

153
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,540
You even made a rubbing

154
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,420
of the Moya Inscriptions!

155
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,420
My Lady, I know

156
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,820
you love the inscriptions.

157
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,060
The mountain path is treacherous,

158
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,940
so I could only

159
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
make this rubbing

160
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,820
and present it to you.

161
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,860
But this rubbing

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,300
(Poetic Exposition of Dongdu)
can't

163
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,140
to witnessing them with your own eyes.

164
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,540
This is wonderful.

165
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,940
That's very kind of you.

166
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,900
If I get the chance,

167
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,220
I'll go see it for myself.

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,140
Great.

169
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,140
I'd be honored

170
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,820
to accompany you personally

171
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,380
as your guide.

172
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,300
My Lord,

173
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,700
Master Zhenshi has arrived in Yujun.

174
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,020
He returned

175
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,860
quite soon, huh?

176
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,220
By the way,

177
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,300
don't tell Her Ladyship any of this.

178
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,180
She already knows.

179
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,380
Master Zhenshi invited Her Ladyship out

180
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,900
as soon as he arrived in Yujun.

181
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,740
He even brought her
rubbing of Moya Inscriptions

182
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,740
and suggested
they go to view the inscriptions

183
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,660
to Yunzhong together.

184
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,940
It just hit me.

185
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,860
Bandits are causing trouble in Yunzhong.

186
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,700
We need to deal with it.

187
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,700
So,

188
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,340
I'll have you

189
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,780
take care of both of them.

190
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,020
Bandits in Yunzhong? Already?

191
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,860
Absolutely.

192
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,620
(Wei Mansion)

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,100
My Lady.

194
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,900
What is it? Why such haste?

195
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,220
You'd better go take a look.

196
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,220
His Lordship had someone

197
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,860
bring an item back from somewhere.

198
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,500
He insists you come take a look.

199
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,660
My Lord?

200
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,540
What is this?

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,380
Exactly,

202
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,900
it's the Moya Inscriptions.

203
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,140
You like it, don't you?

204
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,620
I brought the whole slab back.

205
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,180
Go on, have a look.

206
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,500
- This is...
- Exactly,

207
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,260
it's the Poetic Exposition of Dongdu,

208
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,820
the one you've talked about.

209
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,260
"Keep the lands within at peace,

210
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,460
and maintain harmony with...

211
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,380
(The Barbarians)

212
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,140
the barbarians."

213
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,460
I know you mean well,

214
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,700
but the inscriptions...

215
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,620
Don't you like it?

216
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,020
It's a cultural atrocity!

217
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,580
It's a cultural...

218
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,780
A cultural atrocity...

219
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,500
It's a cultural atrocity!

220
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,540
- Why is he here?
- It's a cultural atrocity!

221
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,980
It's a cultural atrocity!

222
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,140
Lord of Wei, you're being reckless!

223
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,500
What are you doing here?

224
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,860
This is

225
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,300
an ancient precious relic.

226
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,180
How can you just destroy it?

227
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,260
Destroy it?

228
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,740
I brought it back

229
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,860
to keep others from destroying it.

230
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
These inscriptions were

231
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,140
part of a greater whole.

232
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,180
Once damaged, they're nearly

233
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,580
impossible to restore.

234
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,860
I only brought one piece.

235
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,380
A complete slab!

236
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,300
What is this?

237
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,340
Tell me, what is this?

238
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,860
Yunzhong is far.

239
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,060
It was a long journey.

240
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,420
I didn't damage it on purpose.

241
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Besides, here in Yujun,

242
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,620
we have many skilled craftsmen.

243
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,220
I'll just have them fix it.

244
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,020
This piece was inscribed

245
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,220
by a famed scholar

246
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,820
from a former dynasty.

247
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,780
The brushwork

248
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,300
and energy in the strokes
are extremely refined.

249
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Ordinary craftsmen

250
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,740
can't restore that.

251
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,420
You are absolutely right, Master Zhenshi.

252
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,540
How about this?

253
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,060
Please restore

254
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,940
the inscriptions yourself.

255
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,220
You possess deep knowledge of inscriptions

256
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,140
and fully understand
the Moya Inscriptions in Yunzhong.

257
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,340
Only if you restore it

258
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,260
can future generations

259
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,180
truly appreciate this remarkable work.

260
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,100
If it's not too much trouble,

261
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,500
I humbly ask you to take on this task.

262
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,500
My Lady,

263
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,420
your wisdom is admirable.

264
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,060
How generous of you!

265
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,900
Even...

266
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,460
Even men

267
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,100
feel ashamed in your presence.

268
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,980
In that case,

269
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,740
I'll accept this task

270
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,260
and do my utmost.

271
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,500
No, you don't have to...

272
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,500
I appreciate it, Master Zhenshi.

273
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,140
But restoring the inscriptions

274
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,020
will take time.

275
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,860
I may need to stay longer.

276
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,980
Stay longer?

277
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,660
Please stay as long as you need.

278
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,020
I'll personally bring you
your meals every day.

279
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,940
No, you really don't have to...

280
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,460
Much obliged, My Lady.

281
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
Thanks, Master Zhenshi.

282
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,700
Actually, there's no need.

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,900
We have experts here...

284
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,380
Wait...

285
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,020
I don't need him. I can...

286
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,580
Zhonglin?

287
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,140
Sit and have a drink with me.

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,780
Something is bothering you, isn't it?

289
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,700
Would I come to you

290
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,740
if I wasn't?

291
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,380
It's all because of Gao Heng.

292
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,900
He suddenly came back

293
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,660
and wants to stay longer here in Yujun.

294
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,380
I'm pissed off here. Why are you laughing?

295
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,700
I told you earlier,

296
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,340
if you truly like Lady Qiao,

297
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,140
you should be honest with her.

298
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,620
- Otherwise, you...
- Yan,

299
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,140
I...

300
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,180
I've confessed to her.

301
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,820
We both feel the same.

302
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,380
I just haven't told you yet.

303
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,380
Well, that's great.

304
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,180
You should be happy,

305
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
but why do you look...

306
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,300
Yes, it is great.

307
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
But...

308
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,060
Even though she knows how I feel about her,

309
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,700
she's still so close to Gao Heng.

310
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,140
Gao Heng has no boundaries, always

311
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,220
hanging around with her.

312
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,260
It really annoys me.

313
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,780
There's always some outsider

314
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,220
who doesn't know when to back off
in matters of the heart.

315
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,220
Gao Heng isn't that bad.

316
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,820
He just admires

317
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,260
Her Ladyship's talent.

318
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,340
But what if

319
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,340
someone tries

320
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,780
to force their way in?

321
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,820
What would you do?

322
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,620
Who would dare?

323
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
I heard

324
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,500
Lady Yulou confessed to you.

325
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,100
You fell for her,

326
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,460
so you want her to stay in Yujun.

327
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,220
Who told you that nonsense?

328
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm only helping her for my brother's sake.

329
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,780
- No way I'd...
- There are plenty of ways to help.

330
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,540
Sending her home

331
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,300
and visiting her
during the holidays is one way.

332
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,460
Keeping her in Yujun

333
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,860
and treating her like family,

334
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,180
that's another.

335
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,060
Or

336
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,340
marrying her for your brother's sake

337
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,180
is also a way.

338
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,500
Are you serious?

339
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,340
I'm just helping her

340
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,140
for my brother's sake.

341
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,260
There's nothing going on between us.

342
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,100
I invited you here to have a drink,

343
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
but now I'm even more annoyed.

344
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,820
Zhonglin, calm down.

345
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,700
I'll take care of

346
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,660
Gao Heng.

347
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,420
True.

348
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
Some feelings just need

349
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,220
to be cut off

350
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,340
if they're not right.

351
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm the one in a bad mood.

352
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Why are you sighing over there?

353
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,580
I heard

354
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,260
you plan to stay longer in Yujun.

355
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,460
Once I finish restoring the inscriptions,

356
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,380
I'll take my leave.

357
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,500
The Central Plains

358
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,020
is such a vast and rich land.

359
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,460
If I don't go see

360
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,660
those amazing sights,

361
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,060
would I really want to spend

362
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,900
my whole life stuck in Yujun?

363
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,140
Clear and bright, this winding brook;

364
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,580
Deep and still, the southern peak.

365
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,980
Like bamboo, lush and green;

366
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,700
Like pine, broad and strong.

367
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,650
For a true gentleman,

368
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,420
there's no need
to see each other all the time.

369
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,380
It's so late.

370
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,540
What are you doing out here?

371
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,380
I'm waiting for you, My Lord.

372
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,220
Why bother waiting for me?

373
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,700
You're a tall and upright man.

374
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,180
Why are you acting so petty?

375
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,620
How am I being petty?

376
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,180
Any man in the land,

377
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,860
seeing the woman he loves

378
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,660
happily chatting with another man,

379
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,340
I doubt many could stay as calm as I have.

380
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,860
I love you, darling,

381
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,380
because we are kindred spirits.

382
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,980
We speak our minds, act as one,

383
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,540
and stay truly open with each other.

384
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,940
In this life, you are my only

385
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,300
true confidant, My Lord.

386
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,460
So,

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm your confidant.

388
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,460
What does Gao Heng mean to you?

389
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,140
Master Gao Heng is a man of great talent.

390
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,380
His name is known
throughout the Central Plains.

391
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,260
If someone like him serves Wei,

392
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,580
it would boost your reputation

393
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,740
as well.

394
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,060
So, by that logic,

395
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,980
you're doing all this for me?

396
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,740
But now, I suddenly realize

397
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,580
I was wrong before.

398
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,220
Wrong? How so?

399
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,940
You value me,

400
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,460
so you don't want me
getting too close to others.

401
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,420
Even if it's just about art

402
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,740
and official matters,

403
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,460
crossing the line

404
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,140
would still pain you deeply.

405
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,860
It's not quite as painful
as you make it sound.

406
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,340
I was careless before.

407
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,980
But now,

408
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,300
I just need to

409
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,740
find a way

410
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,860
to send Master Gao Heng away.

411
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,060
Can you bear to part with the rubbing

412
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,100
and his travel tales?

413
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,180
I treated Master Gao
with courtesy for your sake.

414
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
If it makes you unhappy,

415
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,260
wouldn't that defeat the purpose?

416
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,940
Since you said it's for official matters,

417
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,020
if I keep fussing about it,

418
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,780
wouldn't that just make me look petty?

419
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,060
I...

420
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,220
I don't mind that much.

421
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,420
If you keep holding things in

422
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,740
whether it's for pride or for duty,

423
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,140
bottling up all

424
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,300
your jealousy and frustration,

425
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,900
then over time,

426
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,060
we'll stop

427
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,580
speaking our minds, acting as one,

428
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,500
and staying truly open

429
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,660
with each other.

430
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Even if you say you don't mind,

431
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,100
I should be more thoughtful

432
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,140
and careful.

433
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,300

My Lord, Lady Yulou requests your presence.

454
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,220
So late? What for?

455
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,340
Lady Yulou said she found

456
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,100
more texts on water management.

457
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
It's urgent, so she had

458
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,540
no choice but to call you now.

459
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
There are plenty of ways to help.

460
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,860
Sending her home

461
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,540
and visiting her
during the holidays is one way.

462
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,780
Keeping her in Yujun

463
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,340
and treating her like family,

464
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,540
that's another.

465
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,380
Or marrying her

466
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
for your brother's sake

467
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,580
is also a way.

468
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,700
Go tell her

469
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I'll meet her tomorrow.

470
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,550
Also,

471
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,740
help me prepare a few things.

472
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,460
Yes.

473
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,660
(Virtuous Words)

474
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Zhonglin, no need to be so formal.

475
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,220
I just found a few more ancient texts

476
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,460
and invited you to review them.

477
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,560
I brought

478
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,540
these as a small gift in return.

479
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,260
Take a look. Do you like them?

480
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,900
There's no need
for such formality between us.

481
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,700
Speaking of which,

482
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,700
Brother asked me
to look after you before he died.

483
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,220
But Wei affairs have kept me too busy

484
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,140
to be thorough.

485
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,980
So, I think

486
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,300
it's best to send you back to Wushan.

487
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,980
Let your family care for you.

488
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,860
That would be better.

489
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,220
Zhonglin, you're...

490
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,140
sending me away?

491
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,340
I know you have your concerns,

492
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,980
afraid of having no one to rely on.

493
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,310
That's why

494
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,420
I've prepared these gifts
for you to take home,

495
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,900
as a gesture of

496
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,540
Wei State's respect.

497
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
On every festival,

498
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,820
we'll continue to send gifts

499
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,180
to show our regard

500
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,540
and ensure

501
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,300
no one dares mistreat you.

502
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,700
I was wrong.

503
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,660
When I came seeking protection,

504
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,140
I believed our childhood bond

505
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,380
still meant something.

506
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,340
But how long can that really last?

507
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,860
The Su Clan is convinced
I carry an empress's fate,

508
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,940
that I'll lead Su Clan
in Wushan State to rise again.

509
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,820
Lord of Wei, your careful plans

510
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,020
still pales in comparison to
the allure of Liangya's royal power.

511
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
My clan will surely cast me aside.

512
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,860
Everyone says

513
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,900
the Lord of Liangya is refined

514
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,140
and powerful. He'd be a perfect match.

515
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,740
But Zhonglin, do you know

516
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,140
why I refuse to marry him?

517
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,620
Because he knows of my bond
with the Wei Clan.

518
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,020
He would surely use my status and family

519
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,300
to strike at Wei State.

520
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,460
I understand your struggle.

521
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,340
After the Deer Hunt,

522
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,660
you outshone every rival.

523
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,700
Now, Wei is standing
at the center of the storm.

524
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,700
People like Liu Yan,

525
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,860
jealous of

526
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,780
your potential to lead the Central Plains,

527
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,460
will stop at nothing to block your path

528
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,780
and set themselves against you.

529
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,460
If I can't escape

530
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,980
marrying the Lord of Liangya,

531
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,620
then

532
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,020
I'm willing to offer myself

533
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,580
as your eyes and ears

534
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,340
to aid Wei State

535
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,900
in its rise to greatness.

536
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,860
It'll be my way

537
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,940
to repay the kindness

538
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,820
the Wei Clan has shown me.

539
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,180
That won't be necessary.

540
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,580
Since I'm sending you back to Wushan State,

541
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,340
I'll announce it to the realm.

542
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,140
If anyone

543
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,380
dares trouble you,

544
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,260
they'll be my enemy.

545
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,580
My lady!

546
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,220
Her headache flared up.
She must be heartbroken.

547
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,020
Lord of Wei, please come another day.

548
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,060
Her headache?

549
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,340
When you were young,
after your family's misfortune,

550
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,900
Lady Yulou stayed up for days

551
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,660
taking care of you.

552
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,540
That's how her condition started.

553
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,020
Then, please take

554
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,340
good care of yourself.

556
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,900
(Poetic Exposition of Dongdu)

557
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,420
Lord of Wei, I'm glad you're here.

558
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,020
After so many days,

559
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,980
I've finally fulfilled my duty

560
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,020
and restored it!

561
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,180
Please put it back

562
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,260
where it belongs.

563
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,620

566
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,380
can it display

567
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,100
its true grandeur!

568
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,140
Of course, I know that.

569
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,260
No need to remind me.

570
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,940
Just wanted to see if you're done.

571
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,420
Now,

572
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,980
you finally don't have to stay in Yujun.

573
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,180
Are you talking about

574
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,780
the stone slab,

575
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,340
or

576
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,400
me?

577
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,900
Of course

578
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,260
I'm talking about the stone.

579
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
But

580
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,380
your style name is Zhenshi.

581
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,140
What a refined name.

582
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,060
So,

583
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,500
I'd say you should be

584
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,580
like this stone slab

585
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,420
and embrace a reclusive life in nature.

586
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,980
Master Zhenshi.

587
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,020
Have you ever trained in martial arts?

588
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,980
Never trained.

589
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,580
I can't even hurt a fly.

590
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,580
Really? Not even a fly?

591
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,380
That's true.

592
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,420
I've never trained in martial arts.

593
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,740
What is it?

594
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,980
My Lord,

595
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,940
someone wants to see you.

596
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,330
Have him wait a moment.

597
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,980
Two hundred and one!

598
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,420
Hurry, get up.

599
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,290
Let me do two more.

600
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,660
- Two hundred and...
- Get up.

601
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,540
And...

602
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,090
Master Zhenshi,

603
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,380
what brings you here?

604
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,490
I plan to personally return

605
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,770
the inscriptions to Yunzhong

606
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,010
to avoid any mishaps.

607
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,140
If you're going...

608
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
I can rest easy.

609
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,220
I appreciate it, Master Zhenshi.

610
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,860
May I ask one more thing?

611
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,660
When will you

612
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,180
come back?

613
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,250
I don't think I'll be back.

614
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,810
I love traveling.

615
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,900
If not for the damaged inscriptions,

616
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,220
I would've left long ago.

617
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,460
That's really...

618
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,090
a pity.

619
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,370
How about this?

620
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,660
Tomorrow,

621
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,420
I'll see you off at the city gates.

622
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,420
Thank you,

623
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,700
Lord of Wei.

624
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,570
Thank you.

625
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,780
Lord of Wei,

626
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,620
I actually know

627
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,490
a few techniques for lifting heavy things.

628
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,010
I can share it with you.

629
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,860
Broaden your shoulders a bit.

630
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,980
That might help.

631
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,620
There's one move

632
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,180
that could work.

633
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,020
Come.

634
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,650
Ready?

635
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,530
Do a lateral raise.

636
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,980
Go on, lift it up.

637
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,620
Here, elbow like this.

638
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,010
You have grasped the essence.

639
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,980
Let's go back to

640
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,330
the move you did just now.

641
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,170
Please, have a seat.

642
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,210
Rest your elbow

643
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
on your knee,

644
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,570
so you won't use extra force.

645
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,090
Now, lift it up!

646
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,420
Very good.

647
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,620
Master Zhenshi, you...

648
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,980
You've never trained martial arts, have you?

649
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,170
No, I haven't.

650
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,620
I can't even hurt a fly.

651
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,640
But how can you...

652
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,740
Do you have any plans

653
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,060
for your journey, Master Zhenshi?

654
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,020
No specific plans.

655
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,260
I just want to

656
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,020
explore the many wonders

657
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,300
of the Central Plains.

658
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,140
But there is one place I must visit.

659
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,420
Yongning Canal.

660
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,860
Why do you want to visit Yongning Canal?

661
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
Master Zhenshi?

662
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,180
This land

663
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,900
has long suffered from flooding.

664
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,180
Lord of Wei,

665
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,900
your work will bless the people

666
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,340
for generations.

667
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,540
I am

668
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,620
deeply grateful.

669
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,020
You don't blame me for
damaging the Moya Inscriptions.

670
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,780
And for that, I'm already grateful.

671
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,180
In this carriage,

672
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,980
I've prepared some books

673
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,860
and a few valuables.

674
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,220
I hope you will accept them.

675
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
Thank you.

676
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,700
I've heard your name for a long time,
Mr. Gao.

677
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,180
I was unwell a few days ago,

678
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,660
so I couldn't visit you.

679
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,900
Today, I came to see you off

680
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,340
with a small gift.

681
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,660
Please accept it, Mr. Gao.

682
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
You flatter me.

683
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,460
It's nothing compared to
how thoughtful Zhonglin is.

684
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,060
I'm not being that thoughtful.

685
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,380
These were

686
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,260
prepared by Her Ladyship.

687
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,060
Well then, it's time for me to set out.

688
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,180
Everyone,

689
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,220
farewell.

690
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,760
Farewell.

691
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,820
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

692
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,580
Lady Yulou,

693
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,420
Yan,

694
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,420
Her Ladyship and I shall take our leave.

695
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,340
That's interesting.

696
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,660
What's wrong?

697
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,820
I can't find my handkerchief.

698
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,340
Did you see it, My Lord?

699
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,460
Weren't you holding it just now?

700
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,020
Yeah, I was.

701
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,540
Nowhere to be found.

702
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,740
Alright,

703
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,820
it's okay.

704
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,940
It's just a handkerchief.

705
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,940
I'll buy you new ones.

706
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,180
Stop it.

707
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,820
(Government Office)

708
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,420
Liangya State controls the water source.

709
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,140
They won't give it up easily.

710
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,780
That's a major geographical advantage.

711
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,660
My Lord, they still refuse to
allow the canal work.

712
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,420
Do we have to change the route?

713
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,940
That would be a huge undertaking,

714
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,780
possibly double the workload.

715
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,380
My Lord,

716
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,260
with our current strength,

717
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,780
I'm afraid we can't bear it.

718
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,340
Why not join forces with Bianzhou?

719
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,340
They're wealthy.

720
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,500
If we can reach an agreement,

721
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,700
it could halve the effort.

722
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,140
Now you're giving advice too?

723
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,460
Bianzhou?

724
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,660
That's our enemy.

725
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,780
A big one.

726
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,340
What do you suggest we do?

00:39:57,947 --> 00:40:00,777
