Then,

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,040
what's his true nature?

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,320
Tough on the outside,
soft on the inside.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,350
Big-hearted.

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,720
Otherwise,

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,800
he wouldn't have allowed you
to stay in Yujun.

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,070
If that's the case,

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,350
I've misjudged him.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for your advice.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,630
Your Go skills are truly remarkable.

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,890
I gladly admit defeat.

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,910
Greetings, Mother.

42
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,120
Mother, you asked for me.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
What would you like me to do?

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,950
I heard from the accountant

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,790
that you changed the candle expenses.

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,350
We're using yellow candles now.

47
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,790
I'd prefer beeswax candles.

48
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,440
They burn brighter

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,510
and produce less smoke.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,470
Nonsense!

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,470
Zhonglin works tirelessly out there,

52
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,720
while you lounge around in here?

53
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,840
You don't care for him, fine.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,670
But now you're making

55
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,840
all kinds of demands?

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,720
Clearly,

57
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
no daughter-in-law can ever match a mother.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,350
Only a mother

59
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,720
can truly love her son.

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,160
Mother,

61
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,230
I've checked the household accounts.

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,670
We're under budget
on candles every month.

63
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,670
No extra costs.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
My Lord!

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
Her Ladyship wrote to Yanzhou again.

66
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,440
She didn't ask you.

67
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,320
I held it back.

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Have a look.

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,040
Aunt, I've been scared of the dark lately

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,120
and having trouble sleeping.

71
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,880
Could you please copy me

72
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,350
the calming and mind-clearing
remedy from Yanzhou?

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
That's it?

74
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,880
All for nothing.

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Wait.

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,670
There's a hidden message.

77
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,160
You all are way out of line.

78
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,470
Do what you gotta do.

79
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,440
A hidden message.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
Only a few shops in Yujun sell candles.

81
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,110
Big, small, thick, thin,

82
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,080
we've got them all here.

83
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,790
My Lady, we have plenty of
candles here already.

84
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,640
Why do you have to do this?

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,600
This candle won't do.

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
It smokes too much.

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Try this one.

88
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,720
Careful, it's hot.

89
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,040
But this one flickers too much.

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,470
Can't sleep well at night.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Well,

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
it could be.

93
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,760
- You're back home.
- My Lord.

94
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,310
What are you doing?

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,670
The candles we have give off thick smoke,

96
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,640
harsh on the nose,

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,080
and strain the eyes when reading at night.

98
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,520
So I wanted to replace them.

99
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,640
We are not an ordinary couple.

100
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,400
Just keep up appearances.

101
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,310
Don't play clever tricks,

102
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,760
trying to snoop into my affairs

103
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,400
and cause a stir in the whole household.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,400
I only changed the candles.

105
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,640
I wasn't trying to snoop into your affairs.

106
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,400
That's for the best.

107
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,760
Her Ladyship

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,280
paid for the candles herself.

109
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,670
She didn't cost you a coin.

110
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,760
I'll have the accountant
send some silver tomorrow.

111
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,550
I rule Wei, a great state.

112
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,200
Do I lack money for a few candles?

113
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,200
I've heard Boya

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,110
used to be part of Wei's holdings.

115
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
But because of Qiao's tricks,

116
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,400
the Qiao flag now flies there.

117
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,910
Lady Xu is furious.

118
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,230
She lectured Lady Qiao

119
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,600
for quite a while.

120
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,110
That's right.

121
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,640
Since she acted without
considering the household,

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Mother certainly

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,160
won't let her off easily.

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,870
Besides,

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
it's been over three months

126
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,470
since Zhonglin and she got married.

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
They're no longer newlyweds.

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,910
Taking a concubine now

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
is definitely not

130
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
seen as disobedience.

131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,160
Actually, Shao approved

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,960
taking a concubine.

133
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,840
Aunt, why not

134
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
go straight to Lady Qiao

135
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,870
and get her to agree to the match?

136
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,400
If she refuses, go tell Lady Xu herself.

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,600
Lady Qiao is clearly in the wrong.

138
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,720
I guess

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
she doesn't even dare to refuse.

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,780
(Betrothal Letter)

141
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,520
This is Zhonglin and Chuyu's
Betrothal Letter.

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,280
The 5th of next month is an auspicious day.

143
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,160
Hurry

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
and prepare for the betrothal.

145
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,790
This matter is of great importance.

146
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,870
I need to ask His Lordship first.

147
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,760
I can't decide on my own.

148
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,990
Is it that you can't decide,

149
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,990
or that you don't want him
to take a concubine?

150
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,790
Zhonglin is

151
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,790
the last of the Wei line.

152
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,230
Everyone in this family is waiting his heir.

153
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,080
But you are still in mourning.

154
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,600
How is our Wei family

155
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,910
supposed to carry on?

156
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,110
Then I'll be direct.

157
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,400
I already asked His Lordship

158
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,160
about taking a concubine.

159
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,720
Neither he

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,910
nor Grandmother

161
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,760
agreed to it.

162
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,710
You...

163
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,910
You're using them to pressure me again?

164
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,620
Fine.

165
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,520
I'll speak plainly today.

166
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,640
Don't think I don't know

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
it was you who egged Zhonglin

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,870
on not to take a concubine.

169
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,310
I won't argue with you

170
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,640
over all your little schemes.

171
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,910
As long as Zhonglin

172
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,230
takes Chuyu as his concubine,

173
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,230
you can take charge of

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
everything else.

175
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,520
You're clever, Mother.

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
That's true. I did try to

177
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,910
dissuade His Lordship.

178
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
When I first met him,

179
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,400
I was struck by his masculinity.

180
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,870
He set aside our families' old feud

181
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
and treated me kindly in Xindu.

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,310
From then on, I saw that

183
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,110
he carried the world in his heart.

184
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,470
He's a truly broad-minded man.

185
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,470
Later, in Panyi,

186
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,280
he saved me from danger.

187
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,640
From that moment,

188
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,230
I swore to myself

189
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,670
I would stay by his side forever.

190
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,430
Enough, stop it.

191
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,550
No one wants to hear
your sentimental rambling.

192
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,630
Mother,

193
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,160
it's all my fault.

194
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,120
I love His Lordship too deeply.

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,550
I can't bear to share him with other women.

196
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,670
You can call me jealous,

197
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,910
or say I'm harsh,

198
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,240
but what new bride,
just months into marriage,

199
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,360
can bear watching

200
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,790
her mother-in-law arrange
a concubine for her husband?

201
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,590
Punish me if you must.

202
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,310
Even if it costs me my life,

203
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,480
I will never accept

204
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,710
Zheng Shu as a concubine in my home.

205
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,710
Enough. That's enough.

206
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,240
You want to see me, My Lord?

207
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,070
I heard you told Mother

208
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,790
you have feelings for me.

209
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,310
Is that true?

210
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,910
I only said that

211
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,120
to go along with your wish.

212
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,640
I had no other choice.

213
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,120
You needn't take it seriously.

214
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,160
My wish?

215
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Aren't you afraid Mother will blame you?

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,710
I just don't want you

217
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,430
to do anything you don't want to.

218
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,550
As the master of this household

219
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,830
and ruler of Wei,

220
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,430
you should make your own decisions.

221
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,280
If you want to take Zheng Shu
as your concubine,

222
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,590
I won't stop you.

223
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
But if you don't want to,

224
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,160
I won't let anyone else

225
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,880
force you into it.

226
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,190
Your words can cut deep,

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
but sometimes they're comforting.

228
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,400
I'll take that as a compliment.

229
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,950
But remember this.

230
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
We are not an ordinary couple.

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,590
From now on, never...

232
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,000
Never try to seduce you with my beauty.

233
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,360
I know that.

234
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Very well.

235
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,160
Well, you should head back.

236
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,240
Alright.

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
Lady Qiao truly has no shame,

238
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,520
using that excuse to brush me off.

239
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,950
Aunt, please,

240
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,590
marry me off to someone else.

241
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,310
Chuyu...

242
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll never forget you,

243
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,670
and I'll come visit you often.

244
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Chuyu!

245
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,360
Chuyu!

246
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,670
Once you're gone, I'm left alone.

247
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,760
It's bad enough dealing with
my mother-in-law,

248
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,310
and now I have to face Qiao too.

249
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,430
How can I handle all this?

250
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Tell me, how am I supposed to live like this?

251
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,360
Now that it's come to this,

252
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,640
do you have any ideas left, Aunt?

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
No, we can't do that.

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,400
Chuyu,

255
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,710
I know

256
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,480
this

257
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,910
is hard for you.

258
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,310
But now,

259
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,310
there's no other way.

260
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,710
If you refuse,

261
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,830
even I can't help you anymore.

262
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,910
Well, Aunt,

263
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,430
I'll do as you say.

264
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,160
Let me propose a toast first.

265
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,240
Son,

266
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,710
I was born clumsy

267
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,520
and reckless.

268
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,240
I've caused you much trouble.

269
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm sorry for that.

270
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,000
Let me have three cups to apologize.

271
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,950
No need, Mother.

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
Please take it easy.

273
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,790
Drink up.

274
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,040
How many cups have I had?

275
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,930
Three.

276
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,070
Three, huh?

277
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,720
No problem.

278
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Here, I'll top off your cup, son.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,790
Eat and drink up.

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
- Thank you, Mother.
- Shall we?

281
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,240
Sure.

282
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,360
Ma'am, it's time for your decoction.

283
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,120
What's wrong, Mother?

284
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,190
I've had headaches recently.

285
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,950
I asked the physician for some decoction.

286
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,590
I was too happy today

287
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,240
and forgot to take it. Let's go.

288
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,400
Shall I come with you?

289
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
No, you stay.

290
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Watch your step.

291
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,480
My Lord.

292
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,550
Lady Zhu

293
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,880
was planning to come

294
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,280
after taking her decoction,

295
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,910
but somehow,

296
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,520
her headache got worse.

297
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,880
Even the decoction didn't help.

298
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
Please, go check on her.

299
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,430
- Lead the way.
- Yes, My Lord.

300
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
My Lady?

301
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,070
His Lordship is here to visit you.

302
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
Mother?

303
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,670
Shao.

304
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,960
Mother?

305
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,400
How does my dress look?

306
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,480
Does it look good?

307
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,400
Shao.

309
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,190
Are you not feeling well?

310
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,830
Shall I

311
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,520
help you rest inside?

312
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,200
Go away.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
I said go away.

314
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,190
- Shao...
- Put on your robe.

315
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,630
Shao,

316
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,070
I have no choice.

317
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,360
Now, I just want

318
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,520
to ease your pain.

319
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,360
Shao, please don't go.

320
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,550
Go away!

321
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,760
Shao!

322
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,280
- My Lord!
- Zhonglin.

323
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,710
- Where are you going?
- Zhonglin.

324
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,550
Go away!

325
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,400
Zhonglin! Zhonglin!

326
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,670
I...

327
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,550
You plotted with an outsider

328
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,190
against your own son?

329
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,310
Zhonglin.

330
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,590
Zhonglin, please.

331
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,790
I can explain.

332
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,720
Look away!

333
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,350
His Lordship is just angry.

334
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,350
Say one word and I'll tear your mouths apart!

335
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,600
Chuyu.

336
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,480
My Lord?

337
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,590
Are you alright?

338
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,960
Shall I call the physician?

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
No.

340
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't let anyone see me like this.

341
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,520
Get me more water!

342
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,630
Water.

343
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,720
So the one closest to you

344
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,920
should be someone

345
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,550
who sees what you see,

346
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,520
and feels what you feel.

347
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,310
I just don't want you

348
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,920
to do anything you don't want to.

349
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,350
If you want to take Zheng Shu
as your concubine,

350
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,550
I won't stop you.

351
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,310
But if you don't want to,

352
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,040
I won't let anyone else

353
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,760
- force you into it.
- My Lord?

354
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,280
Things you don't want to tell others,

355
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,630
you can tell her.

356
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,480
- Leave what you don't want others
- My Lord,

357
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,040
- to handle to her.
- are you alright?

358
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,280
Shall we call the physician?

359
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,720
And you can show

360
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,310
your vulnerability to her.

361
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,280
No need.

362
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,830
Your robe is soaked.

363
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,070
Go change it, or you'll catch cold.

364
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,280
I've told you before,

365
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,520
whatever happens with the Qiao family,

366
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,040
I will never let you be without a home.

367
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,630
Do you remember?

368
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,110
Yes.

369
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,870
You said so, My Lord.

370
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,790
My Lord, let go of me.

371
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
Let go of me!

372
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,360
Your Lordship!

373
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,150
What's wrong?

374
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,630
Are you drunk?

375
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,630
I'm still in mourning.

376
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,830
If I've done something wrong,

377
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,630
just tell me directly.

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
My Lord, you promised me

379
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,200
on our wedding day in Panyi

380
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,350
that I could mourn Grandfather for a year.

381
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,280
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,280
I had something dirty at Mother's.

383
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,520
Bring me some ice.

384
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,920
Mother...

385
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,050
Bring me some ice!

386
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,280
Here's the ice.

387
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,910
Is that enough?

388
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,360
Yes.

389
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,110
My Lord,

390
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll stay right here.

391
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,520
If you need anything,

392
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,070
just say the word.

393
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,910
Alright.

394
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,870
I want some water.

395
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,390
Water.

396
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,630
Here's your water.

397
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,920
I'll get you another cup.

398
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,790
Here.

399
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Bring me my clothes.

400
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,110
Did you get those wounds

401
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,000
in Xiaogang?

402
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,310
Just minor injuries.

403
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,390
Nothing serious.

404
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Are you feeling better now, My Lord?

405
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,060
If you are,

406
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,660
I... I'll take my leave.

407
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,580
Thank you.

408
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,540
His Lordship caught a chill last night.
He's not feeling well.

409
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,180
Keep it down while you're working.

410
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,380
Don't wake him up.

411
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

412
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,460
My Lord, are you feeling better?

413
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,540
No idea what you're talking about.

414
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Last night,

415
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,820
your old wound flared up, so you used

416
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,340
crushed ice to ease the pain.

417
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,580
I've already ordered the maids

418
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,940
to make ginger tea for you

419
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,340
to drive out the cold.

420
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,140
Thank you, My Lady.

421
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,380
Zhonglin,

422
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,100
it was my fault

423
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,940
for what happened last night.

424
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,540
How could I have been so foolish

425
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,900
to do that?

426
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,660
After you left last night,

427
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,180
I thought you'd never accept me

428
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,540
as your mother again.

429
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,460
Zhonglin.

430
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,700
I suppose

431
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,340
your grandmother knows about it now.

432
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,380
Yes, it's all my fault.

433
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,340
I'll go to Mother

434
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,700
and ask her to punish me.

435
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,700
Mother, don't worry.

436
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,060
Grandmother knows nothing of this.

437
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm not going to tell her

438
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,740
and make her worry.

439
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,020
However,

440
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,100
there's one thing I hope you'll agree to.

441
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,540
Zhonglin,

442
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,860
go on and tell me.

443
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,780
Send Zheng Shu away.

444
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,540
She is never to set foot
in the Wei household again.

445
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,700
But...

446
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,780
I...

447
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,700
I understand. I understand.

448
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,540
It's just that

449
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,380
Chuyu has been

450
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,620
with me all these years.

451
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,140
She has no one else to rely on.

452
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,660
If I suddenly send her away,

453
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,740
where else would she go?

454
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,700
Zhonglin,

455
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,540
over these years

456
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,340
you've been busy with state affairs,

457
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,540
and it was Chuyu who stayed by my side

458
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,700
and took care of me.

459
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,900
I don't mean anything else.

460
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,940
I just want

461
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,140
to prepare more for her

462
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,620
and find her a good husband.

463
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
It's my way

464
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,860
of thanking her

465
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,660
for the filial care

466
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,420
she's given on your behalf.

467
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,900
No, I...

468
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
Please, son.

469
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,100
Three days.

470
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,100
I'll give you three days.

471
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,300
I just hope

472
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,860
you learn your lesson

473
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,540
and never act so foolishly again.

474
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,660
That would be

475
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,060
the greatest blessing for me, as your son.

476
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,660
Zhonglin!

477
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,500
Are you speaking the truth?

478
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,260
I dare not lie, Ma'am.

479
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,380
Ma'am, Her Ladyship is here.

480
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,100
Greetings, Grandmother.

481
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,100
I'm sorry I got up late today

482
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,660
and kept you waiting.

483
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,860
I deserve punishment.

484
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,660
You may all leave.

485
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,580
Come here.

486
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,900
Sit.

487
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,230
I called you here

488
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,820
to ask about something.

489
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,380
I heard last night

490
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,980
Zhonglin got angry at Lady Zhu

491
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,780
and Zheng Shu in the east wing

492
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,170
and even kicked down the doors.

493
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,780
I honestly don't know

494
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,100
what happened in the east wing.

495
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,100
You're a sensible girl.

496
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,060
Zhonglin finds it hard

497
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,620
to speak openly with me now,

498
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,580
so I'm asking you.

499
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,380
What exactly happened

500
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,700
last night?

501
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,140
Grandmother,

502
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,220
I really don't know.

503
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,220
What about him asking

504
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,740
for ice in the middle of the night?

505
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,510
You don't know that either?

506
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,220
Lately, while caring for His Lordship,

507
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,580
I noticed new wounds on his back,

508
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,740
probably from the Xiaogang battle.

509
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,020
They haven't fully healed yet.

510
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,020
I presume

511
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,180
he used ice to ease the pain.

512
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,020
But please don't worry, Grandmother.

513
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,660
I've asked the maids

514
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,220
to prepare more ginger tea
for him to drive out the cold.

515
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,420
He should be fine.

516
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,460
Alright,

517
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,300
I see.

518
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
You've stayed up all night tending to him.

519
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,620
You must be tired.

520
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,020
Go back and have some rest.

521
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,700
Then I'll take my leave.

522
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,540
Very well.

523
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Ma'am,

524
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,420
it seems Her Ladyship

525
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,860
doesn't know about this.

526
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,420
Luckily,

527
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,420
we got the truth

528
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,780
from the east wing maids.

529
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,940
That's some clever talk.

530
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,420
She's usually sharp-tongued,

531
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,780
witty and eloquent.

532
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,460
She knows how to say nothing

533
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,060
when things get sensitive.

534
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,580
If you push her too hard,

535
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,620
she'll just make something up to fool you.

536
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,180
She's so tight-lipped.

537
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,500
So,

538
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,700
Her Ladyship deceived you, Ma'am.

539
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,300
Yet somehow I feel

540
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,900
you're not angry with her.

541
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,980
She was preserving Zhonglin's dignity

542
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,780
by covering for his mother.

543
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,580
Ma'am,

544
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,940
just admit it.

545
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,380
At this point,

546
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,900
no matter how you look at it,

547
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,740
you've grown fond of Her Ladyship,

548
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,980
haven't you?

549
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,860
I only care because she cares for Zhonglin.

550
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,380
Since she holds him dear,

551
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,860
I can't help but care for her too.

552
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,940
I truly hope she and Zhonglin

553
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,700
can be a loving couple.

554
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,540
Indeed.

555
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,540
That foolish Zhu

556
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,780
isn't even a match for a young girl.

557
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
She is utterly ignorant!

558
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,140
Aunt.

559
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,220
If Lady Qiao

560
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,540
had even half your thoughtfulness,

561
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,300
I wouldn't have been

562
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,100
humiliated in front of my own son.

563
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,140
You two make such a devoted aunt

564
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,700
and niece.

565
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
Mother.

566
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,020
Mother...

567
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,980
Ma... Ma'am.

568
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,100
What brings you here?

569
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,340
If you need anything,

570
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,300
have a servant call me.

571
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,580
I'll be right away.

572
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,860
- Maids.
- Yes, Ma'am.

573
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,780
Send Zheng Shu away immediately.

574
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,420
I don't want to see her again.

575
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,420
Mother!

576
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,100
- Ma'am...
- Please, show mercy.

577
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,380
- Aunt!
- Mother!

578
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
Ma'am!

579
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,540
- Aunt!
- Mother!

580
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,380
- I know you and your niece are close.
- Aunt!

581
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,140
- I won't let her suffer.
- Ma'am, I admit my fault!

582
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,340
Though Zheng Shu

583
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,540
is an orphan,

584
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,700
she still has uncles.

585
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,540
Ma'am has

586
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,940
prepared a dowry for her

587
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,820
and will find her a good husband.

588
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,580
Lady Zhu,

589
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,220
are you satisfied?

590
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,540
Mother, I will

591
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,220
follow your arrangements.

592
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,780
My Lord, let go of me.

593
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,500
Let go of me!

594
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,620
What is it?

595
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Her Ladyship worried
the chill might make you sick,

596
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,220
so she sent some decoction.

597
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,210
She hopes you feel better.

598
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,500
Anything happened

599
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,820
in the household today?

600
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,540
Her Ladyship visited Lady Xu,

601
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,220
and then Lady Xu went to see Lady Zhu.

602
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,980
That's all I know.

603
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,340
I heard Lady Xu scolded Lady Zhu
in the east wing today

604
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,060
and sent her to meditate
at the ancestral hall.

605
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,020
But I don't know what really happened.

606
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,940
What could it be?

607
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,260
Mother must've upset Grandmother again.

608
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,420
That's not unusual.

609
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,660
I hope she learns her lesson this time.

610
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,180
But it won't be easy.

611
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,420
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

612
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,260
My Lord, please have a seat.

613
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,580
I heard

614
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,740
Grandmother called for you early
this morning.

615
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,620
Yes.

616
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,940
But don't worry, My Lord.

617
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,020
I didn't tell Grandmother a single word

618
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,060
about what happened last night.

619
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,420
No one else knows either,

620
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,580
not even Chunniang.

621
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,900
Let's eat.

622
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,500
(Healing Powder)

623
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,780
My Lord.

624
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,420
Are you afraid of me?

625
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,820
I just...

626
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,340
I'm just worried about your wound.

627
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,860
(Healing Powder)

628
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,860
Don't worry.

629
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,900
What happened yesterday

630
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,660
won't happen again. I promise.

631
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,260
We need to supervise
the Yongning Canal in a few days.

632
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,100
Whose turn is it?

633
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,980
I'm too young. I'm not going.

634
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,540
I can't leave the tavern maid
at Luozhong Tavern.

635
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,980
Wei Xiao, you should go.

636
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,900
Let's draw straws.

637
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,220
What? Again? No way.

638
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,100
You only draw straws when no one wants to go.

639
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm not drawing.

640
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,980
Just get it over with, so we...

641
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,500
What are you mumbling? So annoying!

642
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,340
My Lord,

643
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,780
what's wrong?

644
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,900
He said he's staying at
the Government Office for now.

645
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,620
Probably had another fight with Her Ladyship.

646
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,780
Finished the military embezzlement case?

647
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,100
Yes, the ringleader's caught.

648
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,220
He'll be executed soon.

649
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,620
Then you're just idling around here?

650
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,860
No, we're not.

651
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,380
The Yongning Canal is almost finished.

652
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,740
We were talking about

653
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
who should go inspect it in a few days.

654
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,580
It's not a big deal.

655
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,060
Advisor said

656
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,740
it doesn't matter who goes.

657
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,620
Just bring a few men and make it official.

658
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,820
Since it's not a big deal, why's it

659
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,660
taking so long?

660
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,260
I'll go myself.

661
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,700
It's just a routine check to Panyi.

662
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,820
You don't have to go...

663
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,660
Enough!

664
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,380
I said I'm going. That's final.

665
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,020

His Lordship said he caught a chill.

688
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,460
But why hasn't he come back for days?

689
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,060
Hiding from me, I guess.

690
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,300
He's hiding from you, My Lady?

691
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,100
Afraid I'll catch his illness.

692
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,500
That's rather considerate of him.

693
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,620
Quite the planner.

694
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,060
Planner?

695
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,460
What plan?

696
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,700
Nothing.

697
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,420
I just think he's trying to balance

698
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,460
his mother's dignity and his filial duty.

699
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,940
I feel a bit sorry for him.

700
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,060
Go tell him

701
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,260
to come home later.

702
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,380
I'm not afraid of chills.

703
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,980
Greetings, My Lady.

704
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,500
Why are you packing so much?

705
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,860
His Lordship has official duties?

706
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,540
In two days, His Lordship will go to Panyi.

707
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,940
He asked us to get his things packed.

708
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,460
What's the trip to Panyi about?

709
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,460
The Yongning Canal project is almost done.

710
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,740
Someone needs to inspect it.

711
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,060
His Lordship insists on

712
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,140
going himself.

713
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,460
Just a routine inspection?

714
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,740
Why not let Wei Liang go?

715
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,060
Now he's going to Panyi to hide from me?

716
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,380
Any other orders, My Lady?

717
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,740
There you are, My Lady.

718
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,620
I've been looking everywhere.

719
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,020
Lady Zhu said

720
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,220
since she went to meditate
at the ancestral hall,

721
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,620
she hasn't seen you for days.

722
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,860
She asks you to come, My Lady.

723
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,940
I should visit Mother.

724
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,620
Chuyu's been

725
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,220
by my side all these years.

726
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,860
Now that I'm sending her away,

727
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,540
it should be done with dignity.

728
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,540
If you hadn't tattled,

729
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,220
why would Lady Xu

730
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,700
have ordered Chuyu

731
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,740
to leave with no delay?

732
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,460
Is stealing my Zhonglin not enough?

733
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,860
Now you're driving away

734
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,300
my only niece, aren't you?

735
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,940
You're being way too cruel.

736
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,940
Did your father teach you of this?

737
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,180
Grandmother ordered you
to kneel in the ancestral hall.

738
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,020
You must be exhausted.

739
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,420
I shall take my leave.

740
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:47,860
Stop right there!

741
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,660
Did I say you could leave?

742
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,420
If it weren't for your meddling,

743
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,740
Zhonglin would've married Chuyu long ago.

744
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,260
But now, he's lost face

745
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,460
with both his family

746
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,780
and ancestors.

747
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,560
Seems like your time kneeling
in the ancestral hall

748
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,620
hasn't taught you Grandmother's wishes.

749
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,460
Insolence!

750
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,500
How dare you talk back?

751
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,220
Of course you're the enemy's daughter.

752
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,780
You don't even come close to my Chuyu.

753
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,900
True.

754
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,020
You've always wanted Zheng Shu
to marry His Lordship.

755
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,340
Despite all his refusals,

756
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,220
you still pushed on.

757
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,660
You even schemed just to make it happen.

758
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,820
Now that everything's come to light,

759
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,780
all you care about is Zheng Shu.

760
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,900
What about His Lordship's dignity?

761
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,340
Everyone says you love your son,

762
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,660
but do you really?

763
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,380
You want Zheng Shu to be his concubine.

764
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,140
You tampered with the box

765
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,660
for her sake.

766
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,020
You even drugged His Lordship,

767
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,420
all for Zheng Shu.

768
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,940
His Lordship is the ruler of Wei.

769
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,780
His marriage should serve the greater good.

770
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,740
The marriage alliance is taking effect,

771
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,180
but you keep interfering.

772
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm afraid you don't want His Lordship

773
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,540
to truly take the throne!

774
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,700
