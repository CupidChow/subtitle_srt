00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop!

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Master.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Brother.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Finally you're here.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Then tell everyone

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
why I'm protecting the spy.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why does the border state want me to be a hostage?

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Am I a citizen of the border state or a citizen of the border state?

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Put the case here.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No matter who you are,

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you're my cousin.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But in this world,

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
there shouldn't be a cousin who likes his cousin.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You don't have to say that.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll find out the real murderer.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll give you a clear explanation.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'll tell everyone.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm the son of Chen Pang, the son of the border state.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We're from the Chen family.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From now on,

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm no longer your cousin.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We've been brothers for more than 20 years.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I only ask you one favor.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me go.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let me go.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
From now on,

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll leave Yu Jun today

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and return to the border state.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
From now on, you don't have to see me off.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Go.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Cousin.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've decided.

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Zhong Li, don't stop me.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Believe me.

41
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll find out the real murderer.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Even if you find out the real murderer,

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
there's still someone who doesn't believe it.

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can only protect yourself and the ground

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
by pushing everything on me.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You and I are family.

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why do you have to make a decision?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But what if I want to go back to my other family?

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't tell me that.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Go back and tell your grandmother.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Zhong Li, do you expect me to go back to the Chen family

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and make you the enemy

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so that you won't let Qian Lu go?

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm from the Wei State.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Zhong Li,

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I beg you.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me find my own way.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've been with you for more than 20 years in the Wei family.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have a revenge.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now the opportunity is in front of me.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want to fight.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you think

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you can do whatever you want

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
when you go back?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can be the king.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll be the king.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you don't do what I want,

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you'll regret it.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Zhang Xiu!

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Come on.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I swear,

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
as long as you're here,

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I won't be the chief of the border.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll break into your Wei State

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and take you as my master.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is called the incense.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I wanted to take it away.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But when I think about it,

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been living a life of poverty.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where did I get this home?

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll take it as the farewell wine

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
between you and me.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't cry.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Take care of me.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll be back.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Take care of your grandfather.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yang Xiu!

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll never give up.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll never give up.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What happened last night?

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why did you suddenly hit your head?

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The army came to bid farewell last night.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Bid farewell?

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The female army is in a bad situation recently.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But how could grandma

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
let him go?

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't stop him.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Think of a way.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let grandma have a meeting anyway.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think it's hard.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It hasn't been good since last night.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not good?

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why not good?

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where did grandma hit?

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
She hit her head.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Head?

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Grandma, grandma.

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm so scared.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Grandma.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Grandma, you're always in a bad mood.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Grandma.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why didn't you hit it?

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why did you hit your head?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Grandma.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was late.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hurry, hurry.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Go to my room

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and get the important item back.

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What item?

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The green jade clothes.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I feel bad about this.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You don't feel good?

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Grandma.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll go and get it.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry to make it hard for you.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I just

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
got a bit of a headache.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You actually prepared the coffin.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I...

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You've been waiting for this day

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
for a long time, right?

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I heard the servant's voice.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He said you had a headache.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I thought there was an accident.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So I couldn't help it.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Grandma, don't mind it.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was afraid that

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
it was hard to get that thing.

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I prepared it in advance.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I prepared it for myself.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Grandma, you must have a lot of it.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're filial.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Grandma, talk to grandma.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sun Xi is leaving first.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You guys can leave too.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Grandma, have a good rest.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll go and get it.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I've made the tombstone.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I still

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
can't keep it at my age.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm thinking

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I should

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
leave it

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and go to the tomb.

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not sure

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
if I can keep it

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and if the people I care about

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
will leave me in the end.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I understand.

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I have a family to take care of.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm determined to resign.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you still have me,

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
grandma,

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
grandma,

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and grandma.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They're all your family.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll always be with you.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Recently, the rumors have spread.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Other cousins have left home.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Grandmother is seriously ill.

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
After the end of the year,

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
it seems that someone is manipulating the whole situation.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But don't worry,

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
we will definitely

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
catch the poisonous scorpion.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We'll clear Wei's family's name.

184
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
After the end of year,

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Wei's family's name

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
will be cleared.

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
for asking you to meet me.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Did you know anything?

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Has Zixin not come back

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
from the Lan's?

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I remember doing this

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
so I took the risk

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'd rather let go

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
than lose everything.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can also get

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
what that strong woman can get.

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You have something to discuss with me?

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I have a mysterious case

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that I want you to see.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you know Si Ni?

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You look a little like

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Qiao's sister.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, right.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I heard a rumor a few days ago

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that maybe it's about this woman.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is there nothing else to say?

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know what Zhong Lin is talking about.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He has already confessed.

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He said you asked him

212
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
to take me to see the painting.

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Then he spread the rumor

214
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that my cousin was angry with me.

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Is Zhong Lin a man of faith?

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What do you think?

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's right.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was wrong about this.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But I should think for the Wei family.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I should have been more careful

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to not let Yanzhou's sister

222
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
use Qiao Ni to hurt you and Shiyan.

223
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How could you tolerate her?

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Wei Liang.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Zi Xun.

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Zi Xun.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
At first, he didn't confess anything.

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I ordered someone to make him confess.

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He said that at the grand mother's birthday banquet

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
he was going to report to the pulse.

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I ordered someone to change his history.

232
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He said that he was trying to frame Qiao Ci.

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When I ordered someone to change his history again,

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
he said that the rumor that my cousin was angry with me

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
was made by him.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I thought about the pain of my cousin's finger.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Fortunately, his finger was broken and his finger was returned.

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I...

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Zi Xun.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What's wrong?

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Zi Xun.

242
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Zi Xun.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's him.

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Everyone saw him.

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Everyone saw him.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He's here.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's going to frame the Wei family.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He's going to frame the Wei family.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He can do anything.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He can do anything.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Everyone saw him.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Drag them out.

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Kill them now.

254
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wei Lu.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Wei Lu.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let me go.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me go.

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Save me.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me go.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why did you let me go?

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let me go.

263
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let me go.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let me go.

265
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let me go.

266
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why?

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Zheng Ling.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm willing to do anything for you

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and for the Wei family.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I have no regrets.

271
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You have no regrets.

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
When the pulse was strong,

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I was the female king of Bianzhou.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I had to be controlled by Chen Xiang.

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He was afraid that the Wei alliance

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
would be in danger

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
when the pulse was strong.

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So he ordered me to come to you.

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It was the director of the force.

280
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I had no choice.

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But I'm against the female king.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm afraid I've never done

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
such a cruel thing to you.

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How can I compare with Qiao Ni?

286
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
She was born in Yanzhou.

287
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She has been loved by her family since childhood.

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The people are kind to her.

289
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I was born

290
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
as a daughter of the Su family.

291
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
My family is kind to me.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
My life is miserable.

293
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
My situation...

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
My situation is much worse

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
than Qiao Ni's.

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're too delusional

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
to understand.

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you had gone back to Wushan Valley earlier,

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
how could you fall into my hands?

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm too delusional.

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If I had a good luck like Qiao Ni,

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I would have a man like that

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
who is kind to her.

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why should I

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
have such a bad luck?

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why is it me?

307
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why is it me

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
who has this peony flower?

309
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why is it me

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
who wants to be with the Duke of Bo?

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why can't I

312
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
get married

313
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and have a child?

314
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Am I delusional?

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I just want to be a poor man.

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Zhou Lin.

317
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Do you remember

318
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
when I lived in your family,

319
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we were supposed to be a family.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But the Qiao family didn't do it.

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If it weren't for the Qiao family,

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Duke of Bo wouldn't have died.

323
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The Qiao family did harm to Duke of Bo.

324
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Shut up.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They did harm to us.

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You still have the nerve to mention my elder brother.

327
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You said no one in this world cares about you.

328
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But my elder brother loves you.

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He cares about you.

330
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When he was about to die,

331
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
he asked me to take care of you.

332
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Chen Xiang

333
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
really treats you well.

334
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He built a building for you.

335
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He allowed you to work for Wushan State.

336
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You ignored all the good things

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
of others.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You blamed the world

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
for being unfair to you.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why don't you think about

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
why you don't care about others

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and just ignore them?

343
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No.

344
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not.

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm really not.

346
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I don't want to hear your explanation.

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now,

348
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you hurt Wei State's interests

349
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and killed my family.

350
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Li Ying.

351
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
My Lord.

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The spy of Kagu

353
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Li Ying was killed.

354
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Li Ying was killed.

355
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Zhou Lin.

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Zhou Lin.

357
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't kill me.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm telling you.

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You're the emperor.

360
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Zhou Lin.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Look at me.

362
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not a man.

363
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not a man.

364
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm a hostage.

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You can use me

366
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to collect the people's information.

367
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can also use me

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
to kill the enemy.

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Zhou Lin.

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm a man.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

372
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm a man.

373
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't need this for Wei State.

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And Brother Zhang

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
knew your flower shop was fake.

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But he still contacted you

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and wanted to marry you.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a pity.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You're not qualified.

380
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm not.

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm not.

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm not.

383
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm not.

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm not.

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm not.

386
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not.

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm not.

388
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm not.

389
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For Brother Zhang's sake,

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll spare you.

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How?

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But according to military law,

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we'll do as you say.

394
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

395
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,640
No.

396
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,080
Just kill me.

397
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,440
Otherwise, I'll never

398
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,880
let you and Qiao Yu marry.

399
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Do you think Qiao Yu is true to you?

400
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
All the women in the world

401
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,160
can't get away from the man.

402
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,720
Either they don't care or they're just trying to get something out of him.

403
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
The most important thing in his heart

404
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
will always be Qiao Qiao.

405
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,640
I'll wait for you to be separated from him.

406
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,520
Dai Yu.

407
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,320
Dan Xiao.

408
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,840
Dan Xiao.

409
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,680
Dan Xiao.

410
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,680
I don't know what to do with me.

411
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm not going to

412
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,240
protect you by idiots like you.

413
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,920
I also don't want to

414
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,120
be your shoes.

415
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,520
We're not OVER VOTE product either.

416
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Are you feeling guilty about your brother?

417
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,240
That's true.

418
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,260
He should feel sorry for his brother.

419
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,340
So this garden

420
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,100
is his garden?

421
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,180
Of course not.

422
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,280
Due to what happen right now,

423
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,720
he failed infocused.

424
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,720
볼íll?

425
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,020
is so hard to understand.

426
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
Downtown li Jewel Town

427
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,560
He's so loyal to me.

428
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
He deserves it.

429
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,640
I believe that the Suo King who is loyal to you

430
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,600
is innocent and beautiful.

431
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
At least he didn't let me down.

432
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Besides,

433
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,320
he may not be a fake

434
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
even if he says he's loyal to you.

435
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
What are you talking about?

436
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Wei Shao is the ruler of Wei State.

437
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,800
He's leading thousands of soldiers

438
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,760
and he's helping people to build the Yongning Qu

439
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,200
and water the state.

440
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,160
He's the leader of the Suo State.

441
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
It's not surprising that he likes Wei Shao.

442
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,680
You're talking nonsense

443
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,520
about Wei Shao.

444
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,520
I mean,

445
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,240
people change.

446
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,080
He's been through his own hardship

447
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,640
and that's why he's like this.

448
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,080
So, you don't have to feel sorry for him.

449
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,320
At least it's a good thing

450
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,120
that Bai Yu is back to you.

451
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,320
Yes.

452
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,560
People change.

453
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
What about you?

454
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
Will you change

455
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,720
your feelings for me?

456
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,880
Of course not.

457
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,360
Because I have a husband

458
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,960
who truly cares about me.

459
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
Tell me

460
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
what you wanted to say to him.

461
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,840
He's dead.

462
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,960
It's not your birthday today.

463
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,240
Of course I didn't hear it.

464
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
We met a few days ago.

465
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,660
Verdun is the name of our family.

466
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
The name sutra looks like your family magic.

467
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,680
Are you'!

468
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,040
Yes.

469
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm Yuan Zhicheng's brother.

470
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,120
I met him earlier.

471
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,800
Is that right?

472
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,700
Yes.

473
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,100
I just saw Madam Yulou's face.

474
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,500
It's so horrible.

475
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,100
We should just run away.

476
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,700
Madam Yulou has already gone back to her old self.

477
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,300
The next week, she's willing to go.

478
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,500
If we follow her,

479
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
we won't have any future in the future.

480
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,300
It's all because she offended the Marquis of Wei.

481
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Even the mother's life contract is fake.

482
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,500
What should we do?

483
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Mother, find a chance.

484
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,300
Take her money and leave together.

485
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
The refrigerator is not whole yet.

486
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,380
I can see the

487
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,980
temperature is hitting everywhere.

488
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,020
Out of the house?

489
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
There's one.

490
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,180
Another woman?

491
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,940
How could she bear the味� aprender

492
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,860
of the Wu's general family?

493
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,660
Just find some ways to make her a house wife.

494
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,900
Your flower business is just

495
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Chen Xiang is weak.

496
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,900
She needs your support.

497
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,900
Be cautious.

498
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,900
You're the one who should take responsibility for the Su family.

499
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,460
Mrs. Xu Liu is no longer the leader of the whip.

500
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,020
Don't make trouble for the Su family.

501
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,500
Brother Leng Changxin loves you.

502
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,540
He's in love with you.

503
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,620
When he was dying,

504
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,220
he asked me to take care of him.

505
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,140
Chen Xiang treats you with all his heart.

506
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,540
He's proud of you.

507
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,220
He even allowed you to fight for Wushan Kingdom.

508
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,580
You can't do anything for the good of others.

509
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,340
Because you love yourself more.

510
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,580
You dare to hurt me?

511
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,740
If I live,

512
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,180
I'll send you to hell.

513
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,180
Mrs. Xu Liu is pregnant.

514
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,860
There will be no family who will marry her.

515
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,660
If we follow her,

516
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,580
we'll have no future.

517
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,380
I'll get her money.

518
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,460
We'll die together.

519
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,260
Okay.

520
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,740
Here.

521
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,580
Hurry.

522
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,460
Let's go.

523
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,300
What's this?

524
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,140
It's valuable.

525
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Hurry.

526
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Hurry.

527
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,020
Mrs. Yu Long.

528
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
Mrs. Yu Long.

529
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,900
Mrs. Yu Long.

530
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,500
You want to leave me?

531
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,100
You think I'm worthless

532
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,300
and can be sent to hell?

533
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,700
Please spare me.

534
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,820
Please spare me.

535
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,220
Please spare me.

536
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,860
I've been carrying the Pellet of Mutinous Fate since I was born.

537
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,100
But I can't live with mortals.

538
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,060
I can't live with mortals.

539
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,020
I can't live with mortals.

540
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,100
I can't live with mortals.

541
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,260
But mortals can't suppress my nobility.

542
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,180
I have to be a woman.

543
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,060
You choose to follow me.

544
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,580
I'll keep this love.

545
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,100
Mrs. Yu Long.

546
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,620
Remember.

547
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,460
I'm not the one who wants to marry the emperor.

548
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,140
But the emperor who I, Su E, marry.

549
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,220
Who is the emperor?

550
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,220
I'm here to see Mrs. Yu Long.

551
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,780
Send my order.

552
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,580
Ask General Xue Tai to come.

553
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,820
We'll go to Liangya.

554
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,460
There are many official documents today.

555
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,780
The master is going to be late.

556
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,980
Master is young.

557
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,780
If he gives it to me, he'll be mad.

558
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,860
Even if he doesn't give it to you, he'll be mad.

559
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,460
Come in.

560
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,180
What's the matter, Master?

561
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,460
My neck is not feeling well.

562
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,780
I'll call the doctor.

563
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,140
No need.

564
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,220
I'll press it down.

565
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,900
Okay.

566
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,820
Press it down.

567
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,740
Here.

568
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,020
Okay.

569
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,500
Okay.

570
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,420
You have to press it down.

571
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,420
I don't know how to do it.

572
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,740
That's right.

573
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,420
You haven't married yet.

574
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,500
You don't even have a person to love.

575
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,340
It's not your fault.

576
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,900
Okay, you can go.

577
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,420
See you.

578
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,140
Master wants to ask Ge Zhou Jun to go to the bathroom.

579
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,540
He has sent the order.

580
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,300
I'll go to the bathroom.

581
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,580
I want to ask Ge Zhou Jun to go to the bathroom.

582
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,540
He has sent the order.

583
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,580
It's not a big deal.

584
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,700
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

585
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,580
Do you have any snacks?

586
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,420
I'll go to the kitchen.

587
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
No need.

588
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,460
Just give me something you usually eat.

589
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Meat.

590
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,300
Try it.

591
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,900
Steamed buns.

592
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,060
You can't eat this all the time.

593
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,820
I used to eat this a lot.

594
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,620
It's not the past.

595
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,380
It used to be the past.

596
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,940
Now it's the present.

597
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,060
I'm telling you.

598
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,300
You can only live with these rough people

599
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,700
because you don't have a wife.

600
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,380
This is not enough to eat.

601
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,820
Get out.

602
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,700
Do you want to stay?

603
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,460
No, thanks.

604
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,180
Master, Wei Xun asked you to wait.

605
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,580
He wants me to send you a dress.

606
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,860
Okay.

607
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,380
You don't wear much.

608
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,700
It's May now.

609
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,980
But it's still cold.

610
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll go to the neighbor's house later.

611
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,740
They said they sewed new clothes for me.

612
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,420
The clothes are made of paper.

613
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,860
It doesn't fit.

614
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,780
How about this?

615
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,380
I'll ask Chunniang to change your clothes later.

616
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,140
No need.

617
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
I can just wear it.

618
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,100
What do you mean you can just wear it?

619
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,940
Look at me.

620
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,020
The women changed my clothes.

621
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,620
It's more comfortable to wear like this.

622
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,860
Master, it's late.

623
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,140
You should go back.

624
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,980
No hurry.

625
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,740
I'll tell you a few things.

626
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,500
Tomorrow...

627
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,020
Wei Xun just came to see you.

628
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,220
Wei Xun came to see me?

629
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,460
Master, don't you have something to say?

630
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,980
You can say it. I'll listen.

631
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,220
It's not an important thing.

632
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,380
We can talk about it another day.

633
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,260
Master, I'm sorry.

634
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,540
I'm sorry.

635
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I'm sorry.

636
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I'm sorry.

637
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
I'm sorry.

639
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
I'm sorry.

640
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,260
Master always values ​​the public affairs.

641
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,740
When you go back, the women can wait.

642
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,780
I told you.

643
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,300
It's not an important thing.

644
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,340
She can wait. You can wait.

645
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
We'll talk about it later.

646
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,380
Master, you look busy.

647
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,140
Maybe it's because I'm busy

648
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,780
that we're happy.

649
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,700
Are we that happy?

650
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Except you.

651
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,780
You're talking about women.

652
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,300
Why don't you go back earlier?

653
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,940
You're trying to show off.

654
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,660
You're humiliating me.

655
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,100
Now the relationship between women and masters

656
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,660
is getting better and better.

657
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,620
It's like a new marriage.

658
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,780
Women are happy when they get married.

659
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
It's a new marriage.

660
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,620
Don't listen to him.

661
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,500
If you want to fight against Wei,

662
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,700
you must attack Pan Yi first.

663
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
If you attack Pan Yi,

664
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,300
you must go through Boya,

665
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,900
Xingdu, and Xiaogang.

666
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,300
These three brothers

667
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,100
have a lot of military forces to help.

668
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
It's hard to attack with one hand.

669
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,300
Liancheng is located in the border of Yan State.

670
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
It's a good place to attack.

671
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
It's a good place to attack.

672
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,500
It's located in the border of Yan State.

673
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
It's a good place to attack.

674
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,700
You can attack Liancheng first

675
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,300
and then attack Xiaogang.

676
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,700
It's a good time to attack.

677
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,900
You're being too kind.

678
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,300
Xiaogang is a tough opponent.

679
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,900
Not to mention Liancheng and Xiaogang.

680
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,300
There's a mountain in the distance.

681
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,900
If we run here,

682
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,500
we'll be exhausted.

683
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Then the odds will be even lower.

684
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,700
The key to this battle

685
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,300
is the mountain in the distance.

686
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,300
I've been looking for it in the border of many countries.

687
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
I found that the mountain in the distance

688
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,100
was hidden by a secret passage

689
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,900
that connected Liancheng and Xiaogang.

690
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,500
After I asked,

691
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
I found out that it was the handwriting of the commander of the troops in Boya.

692
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,900
It was dug up in secret here.

693
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
You're smart.

694
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,900
You must know who wrote it.

695
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,300
My cousin

696
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
is really a woman who can predict people.

697
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,500
It's good that she married Wei Shao.

698
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,100
I'm grateful for her plan

699
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,300
that made you succeed.

700
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,900
Your Highness,

701
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,900
I'm giving you the way to win.

702
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,500
Do you know my sincerity?

703
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Do you remember when Madam Yulou

704
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,300
was in love with Yu Jun and wanted to be with me?

705
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,100
I don't know why you changed your mind.

706
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,500
I cried and felt sad.

707
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,900
I had the fate of the peony.

708
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,700
The one who gets me can get the loyalty.

709
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Everyone wants to borrow my poem.

710
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
But they have the heart of a wild bird,

711
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,300
but they're not real birds.

712
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,100
I thought you were like that,

713
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,100
but after you left, I realized

714
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,700
that the Chijun is my home.

715
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,300
Your strong will

716
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,100
made me feel sad.

717
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,900
I'm willing to follow Madam Yulou's will.

718
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,500
Follow me.

719
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Don't misunderstand, Your Highness.

720
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
I'm not here to get the loyalty.

721
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
I'm here to ally.

722
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,100
Ally?

723
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Do you want to use your secret information

724
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
or your fake peony

725
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,100
to get the loyalty?

726
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,700
With my husband's order,

727
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
with my command of General Xue,

728
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
with my personal information,

729
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,300
do I have the ability to kill 50,000 soldiers?

730
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,900
Your Highness,

731
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,100
the most ungrateful person in the world.

732
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,300
I'm not the one who follows the master of the world.

733
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,100
I'm the one who chooses the best.

734
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,100
I'm the one who takes care of the family.

735
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,700
Your Highness, do you think

736
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,300
this alliance is a coincidence?

737
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,500
I heard that Lord Liangya has gathered his men

738
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,700
and is preparing to send out his troops.

739
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,700
It seems that the first step is done.

740
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,500
Madam Yulou.

741
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,700
Madam Yulou, His Highness wants to ask you to go over and talk.

742
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,900
But the matter of sending out the troops...

743
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,700
It's not that.

744
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,100
It's the Su family from Wushan State.

745
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
His Highness wants to ask you to go over and talk.

746
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,300
Your Highness.

747
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,100
Madam Yulou, Your Highness,

748
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,300
I'm here on the order of my master

749
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,700
to ask for Madam Yulou's marriage.

750
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,500
Taoism Tree went over in person.

751
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,100
It used to have a million, a hundred and a hundred,

752
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,300
92 pots,

753
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
and a variety of grains.

754
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,900
It has been in the two counties of Taoism for 20 years.

755
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,100
It wants to marry Madam Yulou from Wushan State.

756
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Impudence!

757
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,300
I have 50,000 soldiers of the Jue County.

758
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,900
I have no intention of being close to anyone.

759
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,500
Madam Yulou doesn't know.

760
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Taoism Tree is thinking about the 50,000 soldiers of the Jue County

761
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,100
and is willing to cut off the supply of the two counties.

762
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,300
Otherwise, you will be married again.

763
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,900
How can you get these dowry?

764
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,300
It's just that my master recently learned

765
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,700
that Madam Yulou is living in Liangya State.

766
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
He thinks that maybe His Highness

767
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
also wants to achieve good things with Madam.

768
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,700
He wants to get rid of the Su family.

769
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,900
If he wants to achieve good things with Madam,

770
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,300
he won't see Lord Liangya give you a title.

771
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,700
The master is confused,

772
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,500
so he sent me to greet you.

773
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,700
If His Highness only wants to talk with Madam,

774
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
without any intention of taking you in,

775
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,100
then let Madam Yulou come home with me

776
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,300
and get married as soon as possible.

777
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,500
I indeed have no intention of taking you in.

778
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,300
Then let Madam Yulou come home with me.

779
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,700
I want to directly turn both sides into the seal of Mrs. Yulou

780
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,700
and give the second-time title to Mrs. Yulou

781
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
in the name of the two-fold reputation of the Taozhou Tomb.

782
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,700
I, Liu Yan, sincerely wish to marry Mrs. Yulou as my wife.

783
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

784
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

785
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

786
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

787
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

788
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:02,700
The Taoism Grandmaster
