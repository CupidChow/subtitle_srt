1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and your kindness

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and your kindness

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget your kindness

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and your kindness

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and your kindness

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and your kindness

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your kindness

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and your kindness

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and your kindness

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and your kindness

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and your kindness

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and your kindness

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and your kindness

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and your kindness

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and your kindness

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your kindness

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and your kindness

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and your kindness

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Will you blame me?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do you say that?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When you were in your home

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you were like a treasure

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but in Weiguo

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you were careful

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Weiguo is not a cage

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for you

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it is no different from a cage

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and I have never seen you

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so free

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I did wrong

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Nanjun is my family

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am happy

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to be with Nanjun

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ok

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Kangjun is your home

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yujun is also your home

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's go

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is my favorite place

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now it is the time to enjoy the night

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I dance

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and play the zither

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can live like this

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
there is more

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nanjun

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
meet your family

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss, I am here

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Miss, I am here

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am here

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I am here

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Nanjun

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is a great man

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He is good at playing the zither

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He is good at playing the zither

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He is good at playing the zither

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I am sure

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I play the zither for you

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
I'll talk to you about it today.

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I'll go over there.

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Man Man.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't get up.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're pregnant.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why are you running around alone?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're still treating yourself as a woman.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're going to be a mother.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not going to be a mother.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to be a mother.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I won't.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,500
If the baby polar bear were born later,

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,700
we would live together longer

85
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,000
than the baby polar bears.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't let it go.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,100
You and I have been apart for a long time.

88
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,000
It's rare to see you again in Kang County.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
I've been waiting here for you for a long time.

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,760
Stop!

91
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,400
Stop!

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
Let her go!

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
Let her go!

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,120
I never took this zither away when I left.

95
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,620
Now,

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,500
I do feel like I could use it.

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,920
I want to hear you play the zither too.

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
It's good that you don't mind.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,880
Concubine,

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,080
enjoy the zither.

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,480
OK.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But it's not a promise

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The moon is drifting away

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The love is gone

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Only the wind and the moon are right

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Who is the one who is the most faithful

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Looking back at the past

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The moon is drifting away

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The love is gone

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Only the wind and the moon are right

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,440
I want to see the old time

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,920
It's hard to see each other

113
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
What's wrong?

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
I and Man Man

115
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
What is our identity?

116
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
It will be fine

117
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Why are you unhappy?

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I just think

119
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm not as good as before

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,920
That day, the new capital was surrounded by the Yan State

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I went to ask for help

122
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
He told me

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You know that the front is in danger

124
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Do you want him to die?

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
You have talent and responsibility

126
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
You can save the people of the world

127
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
But I'm really different

128
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I'm just a woman without a vision

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
No male heart

130
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I tried my best

131
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I can only protect one person

132
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm not like you

133
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
You can do it for the Qiao family

134
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
For the people of Yan State

135
00:08:47,920 --> 00:09:06,180
You want to be a

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I don't care about your death

137
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
In that case

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
You have to do that

139
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
I know

140
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,920
My mother is different from other women

141
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
She loves me

142
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Also loves her family

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Love the people of the world

144
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
So you didn't do anything wrong

145
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
And

146
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I am willing to be your Maoyun

147
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
I will do everything for you

148
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I will fulfill all your wishes

149
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I will fulfill all your wishes

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I will fulfill all your wishes

151
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I have another wish

152
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
What?

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,020
I'm willing to lead the style

154
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Mu Zike

155
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I am willing to lead the beauty

156
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
People say

157
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
My wish will come true

158
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
I am willing to lead the world

159
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Don't worry

160
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,260
I will

161
00:10:37,820 --> 00:11:04,740
The

162
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
This one.

163
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
This one.

164
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
This one.

165
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
Take a look.

166
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Thank you.

167
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
It's pretty.

168
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
Isn't it pretty?

169
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Does it smell good?

170
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
It smells good.

171
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
It smells so good.

172
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Look.

173
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
It looks like you.

174
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
This one?

175
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
It looks like me?

176
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Does this little fat guy look like you?

177
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
What's wrong?

178
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
I'm far away from you.

179
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
I'm so fat that I can't hold you.

180
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
You're so happy.

181
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Everyone,

182
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,740
we've been running all the way here.

183
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
We can only

184
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,740
stay here for now

185
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
to avoid cold.

186
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
The head of the army is here.

187
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I didn't expect

188
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
that there's a place to stay.

189
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
The head of the army

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
doesn't dislike

191
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
us, the Liangya people.

192
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
We'll do more

193
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,740
for the head of the army in the future.

194
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Thank you, head of the army.

195
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Thank you, head of the army.

196
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Don't be so polite.

197
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Don't be so polite.

198
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
Please get up.

199
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Please get up.

200
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
We're going to eat.

201
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Mother.

202
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
It's okay.

203
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Master,

204
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
we don't have much food left.

205
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,740
I'm afraid we don't have enough now.

206
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
Tell them

207
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
not to make wine for now.

208
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Save the food first.

209
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Yes.

210
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Marquis Wei,

211
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
why are you here?

212
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
What's the matter?

213
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
These are the military supplies

214
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
that you brought.

215
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I hope I can help some of the people.

216
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
And the food from the capital

217
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
will arrive in a few days.

218
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Marquis Wei,

219
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
you're really a good friend.

220
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
Then,

221
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I want to thank you

222
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
for the people.

223
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Please get up.

224
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
You're welcome.

225
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
You're grateful to me,

226
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
but I have a question

227
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
to ask you.

228
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Now, because of the cold weather,

229
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
the city of Yanzhou

230
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
is in a mess.

231
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Why do you

232
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
want to take in

233
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
these scattered soldiers?

234
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Why do you want to take in

235
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
these scattered soldiers?

236
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Moreover,

237
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,740
they may also

238
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,740
take part in the battle

239
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
of the Liancheng.

240
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
These people

241
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
are just poor people

242
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
who are lost

243
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
because of the war.

244
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Do you still care

245
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
where they come from?

246
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
People

247
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
don't want to fight.

248
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
They just want to

249
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
take a break.

250
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
Just like Marquis Wei,

251
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
who is the best in the world,

252
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
who has given up his army

253
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,740
and doesn't care

254
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
about hatred and resentment,

255
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
he is still

256
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,740
a kind and kind man.

257
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
He does it for the people.

258
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Indeed.

259
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
If one day

260
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
there is really peace in the world,

261
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
I will work hard

262
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
to make it last for generations.

263
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Even if it's just

264
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
a momentary peace,

265
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
as long as you work hard,

266
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
you can last for generations.

267
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
If all the states and armies

268
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
can be like Marquis Wei,

269
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
we can use our hearts

270
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
to eliminate hatred

271
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
and return to the peace of the world.

272
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
The Qiao's Academy has helped the South Army

273
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
to complete the big task.

274
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
The same thoughts are full of difficulties.

275
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
The water is painful.

276
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
The ice is solid.

277
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
We will eliminate hatred

278
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
and return to the peace of the world.

279
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
I hope that day will come.

280
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
To be honest,

281
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
since they came to Yan State,

282
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
I can't just

283
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
watch them starve to death.

284
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,740
But I have to trouble Marquis Wei.

285
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Marquis Wei

286
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
doesn't have to

287
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
work for the country.

288
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,740
You are welcome.

289
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
The people are innocent

290
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
in the current situation.

291
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I have the same thoughts

292
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
as Yue Zhang.

293
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
I want to

294
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
make an exception.

295
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
I want to make an exception.

296
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
What's your name?

297
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
I'm Yue Zhang.

298
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
I've been married to the female army for a long time.

299
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
But I've been through difficulties.

300
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Now I have the opportunity

301
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
to talk to Yue Zhang.

302
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Yue Zhang cares about the people.

303
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,740
He is no different from the female army.

304
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
I hope that Yue Zhang

305
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
will not be too serious

306
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
and come late.

307
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
I can't stand

308
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Marquis Wei's gift.

309
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
This gift

310
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
is not Marquis Wei's gift

311
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
to the Yan State's military.

312
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
It's the gift of your son-in-law

313
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
to Yue Zhang.

314
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I'm so sorry

315
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
for Zhong Lin.

316
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
I feel even more

317
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
guilty.

318
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
We are a family.

319
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
We don't say anything.

320
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
The night is about to start.

321
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
I'll go with

322
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Yue Zhang.

323
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
I'll go with

324
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Yue Zhang.

325
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
I'll go with

326
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Marquis Zhong.

327
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Of course.

328
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Of course.

329
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Please.

330
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Zhong Lin is not worthy of the title.

331
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
But our Qiao family

332
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,740
is sorry for the Wei family.

333
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Yue Zhang.

334
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
I'll give you a toast

335
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
on behalf of the female army.

336
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Thank you for your kindness.

337
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
Speaking of kindness...

338
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Yes.

339
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Brother and sister-in-law

340
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
will be treated like a son-in-law.

341
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Especially sister-in-law.

342
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
She should drink

343
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Zhong Lin's wine.

344
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Cheers.

345
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Mother-in-law, I'll give you a toast.

346
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Thank you for raising Yuzhen.

347
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
I'll drink with Zhong Lin

348
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
to celebrate the reunion of Yongning District.

349
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
Come on.

350
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Toast to you.

351
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
Toast.

352
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
But

353
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,740
though you're a husband-in-law,

354
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
you're still

355
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
a member of Yan State and Wei State.

356
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
You should call yourself

357
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Marquis Wei.

358
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Marquis Wei.

359
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
My son-in-law means

360
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
he's my personal friend.

361
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740
My brother is his friend.

362
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740
We can be friends.

363
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Well, well, well, son-in-law.

364
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
Zhou Mu.

365
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Call me Marquis.

366
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Marquis.

367
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
I heard that you've been

368
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
wronged many times.

369
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,740
You're a capable man.

370
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,740
But we lack generals in Yan State.

371
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
It seems that you're destined

372
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
to be a member of our Qiao family.

373
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
You're flattering me.

374
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,740
Call me Marquis.

375
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Marquis.

376
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
I've fought with Xuetai several times.

377
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
But I'm a horse slave.

378
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I don't know anything about other things.

379
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
It's just a show.

380
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Fan said that

381
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Xuetai was separated from Marquis Wei and the female army.

382
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
So he didn't dare to send troops to fight me.

383
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Toast to Marquis Wei.

384
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Come on.

385
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Since you and Fan have gone home,

386
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,740
you should stay at home.

387
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
I'll send people to take care of Boya.

388
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
Thank you, Marquis.

389
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Do you really

390
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
think that I have Fan?

391
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Boya is a small place.

392
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,740
You can manage it better than here.

393
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
Besides, I'm used to living here.

394
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
I'm going back after all.

395
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
That's my home.

396
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Manman asked for your help, but you didn't answer.

397
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,740
No wonder Wei Shao lost the battle with me.

398
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Don't worry, Father.

399
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Marquis Wei didn't mind.

400
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:50,760
He's willing to be the

401
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Lianjing.

402
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Naive.

403
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
He just thinks that the writing is good.

404
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
He's just polite to you.

405
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,760
I've told Manman about this.

406
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
I really don't want to take the risk

407
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
to help him.

408
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Manman understands that.

409
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
You're just a girl.

410
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Other people's daughters know how to

411
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
support their mothers.

412
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
My daughter only fights with people.

413
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
You're such a coward.

414
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,760
You even went to the south for a man.

415
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Father,

416
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm not Manu anymore.

417
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
I know.

418
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
The commander of Boya's army.

419
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,760
The army is just a mess.

420
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
You think it's a good name.

421
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,400
I will segue his life

422
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,340
You must

423
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,820
tell him

424
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,300
you are going back to put upту

425
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,860
with Ertai

426
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,100
I'm not

427
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
I'm not.

428
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
What did you say?

429
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,760
Since Father thinks that

430
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Bizhi is Ma Dong,

431
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,560
he won't accept

432
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,760
her as his son-in-law.

433
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,160
Bizhi and I live in Boya.

434
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
It's better

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,560
if we don't interfere.

436
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
You...

437
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,760
Do you know what you mean?

438
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,560
I'm just a girl

439
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
who would leave with Ma Dong.

440
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,960
When Bizhi was in the most difficult time,

441
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,360
my father never helped her.

442
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,960
Now Bizhi is the leader of the opposition.

443
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,160
You want to use me to manipulate her.

444
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I don't agree.

445
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,960
And...

446
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,760
The news of the attack

447
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,760
on Bizhi is my idea.

448
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,560
I never helped my family.

449
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,160
I don't want her to work for my family.

450
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,560
I'm not to blame for this.

451
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Mr. Zhou Mu is not qualified.

452
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm not filial to my mother.

453
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm not filial to my brother.

454
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm not filial to my father.

455
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,960
You...

456
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
Zhou Mu!

457
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,560
Father wants Boya

458
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,760
unless he sends troops to fight.

459
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:44,080
Black

460
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,600
But I have a second thought

461
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,000
You say

462
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,360
Where is the root

463
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,640
Reply to the Lord

464
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,520
Kang Jun came a lot of refugees recently

465
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm afraid the king's reputation

466
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,720
Has already been covered by the Lord

467
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,660
Why should the God take a third step

468
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,760
Fan,

470
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,440
you'd rather

471
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
turn against my father.

472
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't want to,

473
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
but I'm happy.

474
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,200
You're a fool.

475
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,880
You're not turning against him.

476
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Father is a soft-hearted man.

477
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
I can't be a blind man

478
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,240
who has no bottom line

479
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,960
because of him.

480
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
Remember,

481
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,400
in this world,

482
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,520
no one can use me

483
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,480
to manipulate you.

484
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,840
Fan,

485
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm not afraid.

486
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I'm here today

487
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,560
to make you happy.

488
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm the happiest person

489
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,920
by your side?

490
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,040
I just hate myself

491
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,360
for not being like Empress Wei

492
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,680
and making you look good.

493
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
If I care about those things,

494
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,280
I wouldn't have left with you.

495
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,080
I don't hate you.

496
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,520
You're my block of support.

497
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
I value

498
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
your offering.

499
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
It's me,

500
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
groups with people with backgrounds too.

501
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,500
I do like this house.

502
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,180
I smell like you.

503
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,420
There're your perfume smells all over my room.

504
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,680
Do you smell perfume?

505
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,920
Don't touch me in the rises

506
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,760
We'll have a meal with Pori

507
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,600
Then I'll act on my own

508
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,360
Well

509
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,320
We have Юne

510
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,580
We have to follow the rules

511
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,280
So we have to eat in each other's heart

512
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,620
We don't have get things done

513
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,940
Yea

514
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,100
можем

515
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,160
ma'am

516
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,500
yew

517
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,580
I got it

518
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,100
So

519
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,680
Is there anything else you want to do?

520
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,160
Tell me.

521
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,640
I'll go with you tomorrow morning.

522
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,120
Is there anything else?

523
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,520
I can't imagine

524
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,720
what would happen today.

525
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,240
You're not making a joke

526
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,880
for me, are you?

527
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,560
If I say no,

528
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,360
you won't believe me.

529
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,400
If you want to make up for me,

530
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,640
why don't we

531
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
have an exchange?

532
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
If you have anything to say,

533
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,560
just say it.

534
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,320
As long as I can do it,

535
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
I'll do my best.

536
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,400
Then,

537
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,720
I don't have any children.

538
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,360
You really want my child?

539
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,280
What do you mean by your child?

540
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,520
It's our child.

541
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,480
And

542
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,760
I want it now.

543
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,520
I'll definitely give you a new home.

544
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
A home with a firm heart.

545
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
I'll definitely give you a new home.

546
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
A home with a firm heart.

547
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
A home with a firm heart.

548
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
A home with a firm heart.

549
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
A home with a firm heart.

550
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
A home with a firm heart.

551
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
A home with a firm heart.

552
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
A home with a firm heart.

553
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
A home with a firm heart.

554
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
A home with a firm heart.

555
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
A home with a firm heart.

556
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
A home with a firm heart.

557
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
A home with a firm heart.

558
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
A home with a firm heart.

559
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
A home with a firm heart.

560
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
A home with a firm heart.

561
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,520
A home with a firm heart.

562
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
A home with a firm heart.

563
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
A home with a firm heart.

564
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,520
You still have to go back to Yujin in a hurry.

565
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
I can't force you.

566
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,520
I just hope you can stay for a few more days next time.

567
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Have a nice weekend.

568
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
Mr. Yue, we'll leave now.

569
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,520
I hope you can take care of yourself in the future.

570
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I still have something to say.

571
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Of course.

572
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
This is the direction of Weiguo.

573
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
That's right.

574
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
That's right.

575
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Yuanzhang.

576
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
Father.

577
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Yuanzhang.

578
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Father.

579
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Yuanzhang.

580
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Father.

581
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Yuanzhang.

582
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Father.

583
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Yuanzhang.

584
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
Father.

585
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Yuanzhang.

586
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Father.

587
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Yuanzhang.

588
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Father.

589
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Yuanzhang.

590
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Father.

591
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Yuanzhang.

592
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Father.

593
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Yuanzhang.

594
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Father.

595
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Yuanzhang.

596
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Father.

597
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Yuanzhang.

598
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Father.

599
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Yuanzhang.

600
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Father.

601
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Yuanzhang.

602
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Father.

603
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Yuanzhang.

604
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Father.

605
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm taking the Qiao family

606
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
to thank you,

607
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
your father,

608
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
and your elder brother,

609
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
for your help.

610
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I don't want to ask for mercy.

611
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I'm very grateful.

612
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Thank you, Madam Xu.

613
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

614
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Datu.

615
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
The battle of Xindu

616
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
was the fault of the Qiao family.

617
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
I feel guilty

618
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,520
for the three generations of Li Nan.

619
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Our grudges

620
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
were caused by our grandmother.

621
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
I've already made up my mind.

622
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Marquis Wei doesn't mind.

623
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
But I can't pretend to be confused.

624
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
I was just hoping that

625
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
I could marry a good-hearted woman

626
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
and have a husband

627
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
to spend the rest of my life with.

628
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
But I had no choice.

629
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
My father was in danger

630
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
before he died.

631
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
He had a marriage with Marquis Wei.

632
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
If the Qiao family

633
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
is in danger,

634
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
I'll ask myself.

635
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
If I can't do it,

636
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I'll marry a bad-hearted woman.

637
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,520
But Madam Xu is kind and generous.

638
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
She's very kind to me.

639
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
But Marquis Wei is too kind.

640
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
He's too weak.

641
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
I'll ask him to

642
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
let go of his wife

643
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
and take her home.

644
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
I'll take her home

645
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
and live in Yanzhou.

646
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I feel more ashamed.

647
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,520
I was just being doubtful.

648
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,520
I was just being selfish.

649
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Li Cheng,

650
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
I feel ashamed too.

651
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,520
I've made it hard for you

652
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
and treated you badly.

653
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
When will you treat me?

654
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
I'm useless.

655
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm just a fool.

656
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
The only thing I can't rest assured

657
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
is my daughter.

658
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
I'll take this opportunity

659
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
to entrust Marquis Wei with everything.

660
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Please treat me

661
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
and protect me

662
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
with your heart.

663
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
I'll never

664
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
see you again.

665
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
I promise you,

666
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
I'll love you more

667
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
and more in the future.

668
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Please trust me.

669
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I will.

670
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
I will.

671
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Li Jun,

672
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
this is the medicine and weapon

673
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
for tomorrow's ritual.

674
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
It's prepared and

675
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
used for thousands of years.

676
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
What do you mean?

677
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
The medicine and weapon

678
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
are used for thousands of years.

679
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
You'll never know

680
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
how much time it'll take

681
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
to prepare it.

682
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
You'll never know

683
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
how much time it'll take

684
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
to prepare it.

685
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I'll be waiting

686
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
for you

687
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
to get the reward.

688
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
You'll remember your father.

689
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
You've worked so hard.

690
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
I wonder if you can

691
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
get the imperial edict.

692
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
Don't think about it.

693
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
When we were in the fishing village,

694
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
we were thrown out of the city

695
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
to avoid the ritual.

696
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Logically,

697
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
if the bride and groom

698
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
don't attend the imperial edict,

699
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
they won't be accepted

700
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
and accepted.

701
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
It's up to you

702
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
to decide.

703
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
You'll know it

704
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
when you see your husband's attitude.

705
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Besides,

706
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
if you want to

707
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
let my grandparents,

708
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
my mother-in-law and my husband

709
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
allow me to enter the ancestral hall,

710
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
it's too hard for you.

711
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Why bother

712
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
with your own worries?

713
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Li Jun,

714
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
this is the medicine

715
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
for thousands of years

716
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
for the ritual

717
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
for the man who asked his wife

718
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
to do the ritual.

719
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Li Jun,

720
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
this is the wedding dress for the ritual.

721
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Nan Jun.

722
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Let's go.

723
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Let's go.

724
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Put down the wedding dress.

725
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
Put down the wedding dress.

726
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
Grandfather,

727
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
father,

728
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,520
and elder brother.

729
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
This is my wife,

730
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Qiao Shi.

731
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm sorry.

732
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
I'm sorry.

733
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I'm sorry.

736
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm sorry.

740
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
I'm sorry.

741
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
I'm sorry.

742
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I'm sorry.

746
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
I'm sorry.

754
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,520
I'm sorry.

755
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
I'm sorry.

757
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm sorry.

758
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm sorry.

759
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
I'm sorry.

760
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm sorry.

761
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I'm sorry.

762
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
I'm sorry.

763
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I'm sorry.

764
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
I'm sorry.

765
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
I'm sorry.

766
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
I'm sorry.

768
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
I'm sorry.

769
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
I'm sorry.

770
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
I'm sorry.

771
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
I'm sorry.

772
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
