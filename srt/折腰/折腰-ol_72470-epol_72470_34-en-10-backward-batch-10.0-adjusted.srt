I...

31
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,740
It's you?

32
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,740
My Lord.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
It's been a long while.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,130
So, he's the one you spoke of?

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,500
Do you know, months ago,

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,410
he attacked Yanzhou,

37
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,610
causing us tens of thousands of casualties?

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,380
I offended you before.

39
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,730
But may I now have
the chance to redeem myself?

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,500
If we join hands this time,

41
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,660
we could help you reclaim true authority,

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,940
and take back Panyi for Yanzhou.

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,100
Panyi?

44
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,260
Governor, you're a man of great talent,

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,410
wise and formidable in battle,

47
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,130
much like the late Lord Qiao.

48
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,100
But Prefect

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,890
has long coveted your position.

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,290
He has plotted carefully.

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,940
Now he controls the troops,

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,820
and has Wei Shao as his son-in-law.

53
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,450
As the Lord of Yanzhou,

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,690
do you truly accept being beneath him?

55
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,060
What's the point of these words?

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,100
If Wei Shao falls,

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,690
Yanzhou will be the strongest force.

58
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,570
Qiao Ping will be left without support.

59
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,170
If you will not submit to him,

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,010
why not take a chance?

61
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,850
You want to kill the Lord of Wei?

62
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,380
Wei State now draws strength
from regions to build the canal.

63
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,130
Soon, their strength will be unstoppable.

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,380
If we do not act now,

65
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,100
there may never be another chance.

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,100
Over the past months,

67
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,690
I've reached out to many forces,

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,010
rallied troops to resist Wei State.

69
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,260
Xue Tai, a valiant warrior,
has also pledged support.

70
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,100
We'll strike from two fronts.

71
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,340
Everything is ready,

72
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,730
except your resolve

73
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,100
to cast off Wei State's yoke.

74
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,890
So, you've come to persuade me?

75
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,890
I have come today,

76
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,060
only seeking a powerful alliance with you

77
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,290
to crush Wei State

78
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,380
and divide its lands.

79
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,250
Ping, my brother.

80
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,220
It's been a long time
since we had an evening like this,

81
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,660
just sitting and drinking together.

82
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,410
Let me take this chance

83
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,020
to toast you first.

84
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,460
Bottoms up.

85
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,980
I know I'm mediocre.

86
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,700
All these years,

87
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,340
it's you who held everything together.

88
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,930
I'm proud of you,

89
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,730
but also ashamed that I've done so little.

90
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,610
Here's a second cup

91
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,490
to show my respect.

92
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,540
Yue,

93
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,250
please don't put me on a pedestal.

94
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,410
If not for you,

95
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,580
who always showed such grace,

96
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,410
what could I

97
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,850
have done alone?

98
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,730
I should be the one

99
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,460
to toast you.

100
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,900
Very well.

101
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,340
As long as we stand united,

102
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,050
there's nothing we can't overcome.

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,620
Cheers.

104
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,140
I have something

105
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,980
to tell you, Ping.

106
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,730
Please go on.

107
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,140
I've decided

108
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,850
to lead Yanzhou

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,780
in allegiance to Liu Yan, Lord of Liangya,

110
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,490
and sever all ties
with Wei Shao of Wei State.

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,090
Why?

112
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,420
No...

113
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,620
wait.

114
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,980
Why didn't you

115
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,250
say a word of this beforehand?

116
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,340
Ping, what do you mean?

117
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,540
Must I seek your permission

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,730
for every decision?

119
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,930
That's not what I meant.

120
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,250
Right now,

121
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,490
the realm is in turmoil
and its future uncertain.

122
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,980
Yanzhou, for the moment,

123
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,050
can still hold its own.

124
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,410
In my view,

125
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,140
we should wait and observe.

126
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,410
It's unwise to turn to Liangya so hastily.

127
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,460
Yue,

128
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,700
have you ever considered

129
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,250
our Qiao Clan has an in-law relationship

130
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,660
with the Wei Clan.

131
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,540
If one is in trouble,

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,930
the other should come to its aid.

133
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,540
Even if not,

134
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,540
we shouldn't betray them.

135
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,050
So in the end,

136
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,250
you just want to tie Yanzhou's fate

137
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,250
and the Qiao Clan's

138
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,930
to Wei Shao?

139
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,730
Am I right?

140
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,220
Back then,

141
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,850
when our families allied by marriage,

142
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,610
Yue,

143
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,250
you supported it too.

144
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,020
But now,

145
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,340
at the first sign of trouble,

146
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,700
you're ready to turn your back!

147
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,850
How is this

148
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,610
any different

149
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,540
from being a turncoat?

150
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,490
How dare you speak to me this way.

151
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,490
Do you still see me as your elder brother?

152
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,460
Remember, I am the Lord of Yanzhou!

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,540
I have no sons.

154
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,700
I treat Ci as my own.

155
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,020
Why do you think I'm doing this?

156
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,780
Do you really believe it's for myself?

157
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,610
I'm doing this for Yanzhou's future!

158
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,930
Know this,

159
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,580
my alliance with Liangya

160
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,340
is not open to your objections!

161
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,450
You...

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,220
You drugged my wine!

163
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,370
No, I didn't.

164
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,410
- I didn't.
- My eyes...

165
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,180
You traitor!

166
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Traitor...

167
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,690
Is he dead?

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
He's still breathing.

169
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,370
What did you give him?

170
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,770
Why can't he see anything?

171
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,530
I don't know.

172
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,100
Liu Shan gave me the drug.

173
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,650
He said it's much stronger
than ordinary knockout drops.

174
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,060
It must be

175
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,010
his rage.

176
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,650
It triggered temporary blindness.

177
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,250
He might recover in a few days.

178
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,970
My Lord,

179
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,250
our top priority must be
to seize control of Prefect,

180
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,940
take back command of the troops,

181
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,340
and take charge of the situation.

182
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,580
How is Ci right now?

183
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,010
Wait.

184
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,850
Only restrain him. Do not harm him.

185
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,180
Rest assured, My Lord.

186
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,820
I've sent trusted men to guard him closely.

187
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,260
(Boya)

188
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,940
Look over here,

189
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,980
Li.

190
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,970
Ma'am,

191
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,610
here's a letter from Kangjun.

192
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,420
Is it from Ci?

193
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,340
(I heard you had a son.)
What does it say?

194
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,900
(I hope you and Bi Zhi return to Kangjun
to enjoy family time.)

195
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,610
It's from Father.

196
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,580
He heard

197
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,220
I have a son

198
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,490
and wants to meet Li.

199
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,940
He hopes we bring him back
to Kangjun for a while.

200
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,580
I know grandparents have a special bond

201
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,610
with their grandkids.

202
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,940
Father must be so happy

203
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,180
to be a grandfather now.

204
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,420
He must have forgotten past arguments.

205
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,700
I hope so.

206
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,820
But Father

207
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,420
really does love children.

208
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,010
When we were young,

209
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,530
he treated us so well.

210
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,650
He's fallen asleep.

211
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,420
I'll go find some fast horses.

212
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,580
We'll set out at once.

213
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,370
No rush.

214
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,650
We're going back to Kangjun.

215
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,340
(Kangjun)

216
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,370
There they are.

217
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,820
Whoa.

218
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,580
Fan, get down.

219
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,460
- Father.
- Father.

220
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,490
We've waited so long for you.

221
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,180
Where are Mother, Uncle, and Ci?

222
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,940
They're all waiting in the mansion.

223
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,770
I heard you've been good to Fan.

224
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,460
You often pick sour plums for her?

225
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,300
Yes.

226
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,340
I learned the recipe

227
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,980
to pickle them from a kitchen maid.

228
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,650
She loves them.

229
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,700
What a coincidence.

230
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
The plums in Kangjun are ripe now.

231
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
They're in the West Hill.

232
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,730
Go pick some for her.

233
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's have a taste as well.

234
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,730
- Yes.
- Father.

235
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,010
We've only just arrived.

236
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,340
Don't send Bi Zhi

237
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,980
off on errands right away.

238
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Besides,

239
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,100
back when Mother was in Boya,

240
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,010
I stopped him from picking sour plums.

241
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,890
He's a respected leader now.

242
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,340
Since he's my son-in-law,

243
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,610
he ought to show some filial piety.

244
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,580
Earlier,

245
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,220
I acted rashly driven by
anger toward Wei Shao.

246
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,700
I did something inappropriate.

247
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,530
You and I share the same blood.

248
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
I should treat Bi Zhi well.

249
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,180
The two of you should hold

250
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,770
a proper wedding ceremony.

251
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,010
Now that you have a son,

252
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,980
it's time to make it official.

253
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,460
Father, I'll be right back.

254
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,220
Good, don't be long.

255
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,980
- Bi Zhi...
- Don't worry.

256
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,060
I'll be right back.

257
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,420
Come to the mansion with me.

258
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,770
Li is still in the carriage.

259
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,890
We'll fetch him in a moment.

260
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,890
Bi Zhi! Come back!

261
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,490
Father, what are you doing?

262
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,090
- Gag her.
- Let me go!

263
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,650
What are you doing?

264
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,530
Bi Zhi!

265
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,090
Bi Zhi,

266
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,650
stop right now,

267
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,250
or she'll get hurt.

268
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,610
So, you're Bi Zhi, the green-eyed stableman.

269
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,650
Just as Xue Tai said, you're hard to handle,

270
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,580
but you love your wife deeply.

271
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,850
All the better.

272
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,130
You'll make a fine weapon

273
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,300
against Wei Shao.

274
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,580
I once swore an oath.

275
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,530
I will never harm Lord of Wei
or Her Ladyship.

276
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,850
In that case,

277
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,370
she'll get hurt.

278
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,690
Stop!

279
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,060
Kneel.

280
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,300
Kneel!

281
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,300
From this day forth,

282
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,010
be you a stableman

283
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,370
or my slave,

284
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,610
stay by my side,

285
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,820
and obey my command.

286
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,940
If not...

287
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,660
Well then,

288
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,890
you can try and see

289
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,820
whether you're faster

290
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,100
than my blade.

291
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,140
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

292
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,250
- Whoa.
- Stop.

293
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,460
State your name and purpose.

294
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,490
I'm Wei Liang from Wei State,

295
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,500
here on Lord of Wei's orders

296
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
to invite Prefect of Kangjun.

297
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,490
General Wei, please wait a moment.

298
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,130
General, Wei Liang has arrived.

299
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,970
Shall we let him in?

300
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,770
General Wei,

301
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,640
you may enter.

302
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Giddy-up.

303
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,860
(Kangjun Wharf)

304
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,930
Shopkeeper,

305
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,460
do you have any fine orchids from Yanzhou?

306
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,100
The fine ones are back at my home.

307
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,010
They're costly, though.

308
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,980
Still want them?

309
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,060
Price is no issue.

310
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,010
Give me the best.

311
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,490
Sure. Follow me.

312
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,130
Move aside!

313
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,980
Out of the way!

314
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,940
Move it!

315
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,500
Shopkeeper,

316
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,330
has Kangjun been peaceful lately?

317
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,180
Thanks to Prefect,

318
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,140
every home sleeps with their doors wide open.

319
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,860
But why are there

320
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,490
so many patrols on the street?

321
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,460
I don't know why.

322
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,090
There are more patrols lately. That's true.

323
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,050
Let's go.

324
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,980
Governor.

325
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,330
General, your arrival is sudden.

326
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,530
May I ask what brings you here?

327
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,620
Her Ladyship misses her father,

328
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,250
so His Lordship sent me here
to invite Prefect Qiao

329
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,770
to stay in Yujun for a while

330
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,490
until Her Ladyship gives birth.

331
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,010
They can enjoy some family time.

332
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,090
To invite Prefect?

333
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,530
Manman is about to give birth.

334
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,380
He is a man, after all.

335
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,250
He can't help much there.

336
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,050
He'd only cause trouble for the Lord of Wei.

337
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,920
How about this?

338
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,490
Once Manman gives birth safely,

339
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,570
I'll visit them with Ci.

340
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,290
Governor, you're overthinking.

341
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,810
It's no trouble at all.

342
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,050
How about we ask Prefect

343
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,660
and hear his thoughts?

344
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,250
My brother hasn't been well lately.

345
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,980
He's resting at home now,

346
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,420
not seeing guests.

347
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,330
Prefect is sick?

348
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,730
Then I should visit him

349
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,460
to show His Lordship's filial piety.

350
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,290
I'll go right now...

351
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,090
He just took some herbal soup and is asleep.

352
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
I'll send someone to check if he's awake.

353
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,900
Mr. Zhang,

354
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,900
go and take a look.

355
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,930
Yes.

356
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,050
This kind of small thing

357
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,620
should be left to servants.

358
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,090
Why trouble Advisor

359
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,330
with such things?

360
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,380
Zhang Pu is more thoughtful.

361
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,460
Where's Young Master Ci?

362
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,730
I haven't seen him in a while.

363
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,860
I truly miss him.

364
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,380
Ci went hunting in the hills.

365
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,570
It's getting late,

366
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,860
and he's not back yet?

367
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,730
He's still a kid

368
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,700
and really playful.

369
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,090
By the way,

370
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,010
I heard in Boya

371
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,490
that General Bi Zhi and Ma'am

372
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,050
were invited here in Kangjun too.

373
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,330
Did they bring their child?

374
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,810
May I visit them?

375
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,860
General, must you ask about

376
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,420
every single member of my family?

377
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,090
General,

378
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,730
was Ma'am's delivery smooth?

379
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,060
General,

380
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,090
you...

381
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,570
Governor,

382
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,940
you want to side with Liu Yan?

383
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,770
Since Wei Shao's lackey is here,

384
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,460
there's no way you'll make it back alive.

385
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,890
Bi Zhi,

386
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,250
you green-eyed scum!

387
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,570
You'd betray Lord of Wei too?

388
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,060
Bi Zhi,

389
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,570
what are you waiting for?

390
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,570
Don't you care about your wife and son?

391
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,540
Go get him!

392
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,900
Hurry! Go get him!

393
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,130
My Lady.

394
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,770
I've prepared some food for Ci.

395
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,220
By His Lordship's order,

396
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,330
no one is allowed inside.

397
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,170
Insolence!

398
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,940
How dare you speak to me like this?

399
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,860
Am I not the Lady of Yanzhou?

400
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,660
I need to

401
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,010
check the food box, My Lady.

402
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,770
Do you need to search me as well?

403
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,810
I wouldn't dare.

404
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,850
Let her in.

405
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,300
- Aunt.
- Ci.

406
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,490
- Ci.
- Aunt.

407
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,250
What happened out there?

408
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,330
How is my father?

409
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,290
Why did Uncle lock me up?

410
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,050
Don't call him Uncle anymore.

411
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,250
He's allied himself with Liu Yan

412
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,730
and is plotting against the Lord of Wei.

413
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,090
Your father and Cousin are locked away too.

414
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,380
Even Bi Zhi is being forced

415
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,730
to serve them now.

416
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,770
General Wei Liang came unexpectedly,

417
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,770
and they attacked him.

418
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,250
We don't even know if he's still alive.

419
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,860
Ci, your top priority now

420
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,140
is to get out of here,

421
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,180
rescue General Wei Liang,

422
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,530
and inform Lord of Wei.

423
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,850
My Lady!

424
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,570
Step aside!

425
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,460
Young Master Ci, calm down.

426
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,380
Step back!

427
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,290
- Step back!
- Make...

428
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,290
Make way!

429
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,900
Ci! Ci!

430
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,700
Get out of the way, you all!

431
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,220
If anything happens to Ci,

432
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,860
how will you explain to Governor?

433
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,140
Move!

434
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,820
Ci?

435
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,020
Move aside!

436
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,500
Ci?

437
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,940
Young Master Ci, please stay calm.

438
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,380
Don't follow me.

439
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,620
Aunt,

440
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,300
take care.

441
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,140
- Go get him!
- Ci!

442
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,620
Ci! Ci!

443
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,530
Are you alright, My Lady?

444
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,730
Ci...

445
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,570
My Lady.

446
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,980
Stop right there!

447
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,460
Go after him!

448
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Don't run!

449
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,570
Stop!

450
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,110
Stop!

451
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,330
- Don't run.
- Don't run.

452
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,500
Go get him!

453
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,660
Bring the orchids to Wei and tell them,

454
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
Boya has rebelled!

455
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,050
Kangjun has rebelled!

456
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,890
General!

457
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Tell Xiaotao

458
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,010
not to wait for me!

459
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,620
Xiaotao,

460
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,250
don't wait for me.

461
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,220
My Lord, be careful.

462
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,940
Where is Ci?

463
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,810
He escaped.

464
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,220
I've sent men after him.

465
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,250
He escaped?

466
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,290
Whatever happens, don't take his life.

467
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,180
My Lord.

468
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,380
In this case,

469
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,900
our secret plans

470
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,530
will likely be exposed.

471
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,180
Then we don't hide it.

472
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,330
Let's start the war.

473
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,290
Attack Panyi

474
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,730
and catch them off guard.

475
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,330
If we control the Yongning Canal,

476
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,900
we control the lifeline of every region.

477
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,940
Seriously?

478
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,570
Panyi is heavily guarded.

479
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,900
It's not so easy to take.

480
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,980
Exactly.

481
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,980
That's up to you, Governor.

482
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,050
Can you find a way

483
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,050
to knock the gates of Panyi open?

484
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,540
Well...

485
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,530
Yang Feng, Mayor of Panyi,

486
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,290
once served my father closely.

487
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,940
He's a slippery one, though.

488
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,570
Let's hope he doesn't stop us.

489
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,860
(Panyi City, Wei State)

490
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,860
(Panyi)

491
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,140
(Wei)

492
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,010
Open the gates!

493
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,660
Open the gates now!

494
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,980
Open the gates.

495
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,860
Open the gates now!

496
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,420
What's going on, General?

497
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,220
Lord Yang, look.

498
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,050
Why would they suddenly show up like this?

499
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,530
Both Governor of Yanzhou

500
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,570
and Commander of Boya Forces

501
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,730
come here together.

502
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,460
General, let me ask them.

503
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,490
Governor,

504
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,860
why have you

505
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,250
brought troops here?

506
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,140
Yang Feng,

507
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,090
Liu Yan attacked Kangjun.

508
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,290
Luckily, Bi Zhi saved us.

509
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,140
Open the gates quickly. I seek refuge.

510
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,900
Please wait a moment, Governor.

511
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,080
General,

512
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,620
Wei State and Yanzhou are bound

513
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
by both marriage

514
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,770
and alliance.

515
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,900
Please allow the family of the late Lord Qiao

516
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,140
to take shelter in the city,

517
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,010
and send a message to Yujun

518
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,980
without delay.

519
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,620
Well...

520
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,010
Thank you very much, General.

521
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,130
Alright.

522
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,510
Open the gates!

523
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,810
Open the gates now!

524
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,570
Governor,

525
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,810
please enter quickly.

526
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,330
General... General Bi Zhi,

527
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,050
what are you doing?

528
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,330
Yang Feng,

529
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,570
I've allied with Liangya

530
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,700
to resist Wei State.

531
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,460
From this day on,

532
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,460
Panyi returns to Yanzhou's rule.

533
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,810
You once served my father closely

534
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,220
and are a man of wit.

535
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,700
I trust you know

536
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
what must be done,

537
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,060
don't you?

538
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,650
Yes, I do.

539
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,740
Governor,

540
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,490
your march here with so many troops.

541
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,180
Has Xindu noticed?

542
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,140
Xindu?

543
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,330
In this realm,

544
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,700
who could possibly rival Bi Zhi?

545
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
True.

546
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,180
And what about Zhen Zhi?

547
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,980
Bi Zhi.

548
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,810
He lacked your subtlety

549
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,940
and tried to stop us.

550
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,620
He fell in the line of duty.

551
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,530
Governor.

552
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
My Lord.

553
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,660
Mayor Yang, please

554
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,380
inform all regions.

555
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,900
The watergate at Yongning Canal

556
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,330
is now under my control.

557
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,620
All forces and nobles must reconsider

558
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,810
where their loyalties lie.

559
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,890
Yes,

560
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,740
I understand.

561
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,300
(Panyi, Wei)

562
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,460
(Qiao)

563
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,290
You fell in the line of duty?

564
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,700
If I had known sooner,

565
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,010
I would've had a drink with you

566
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
back in Rongjun.

567
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,700
Liu Yan's evil heart never dies.

568
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,250
If such a warmonger gains control of

569
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,620
(Governor of Yenzhou)
the water source,

570
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,220
how can the realm ever find peace?

571
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,050
Want me to join him?

572
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,210
Never!

573
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,050
I told them to follow the Lord of Liangya,

574
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,380
(Governor of Taozhou)
but they wouldn't listen.

575
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,380
Luckily, we chose our side early.

576
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,460
We might yet claim

577
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,770
a share of the spoils.

578
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,770
Wei State is too strong.

579
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,140
(Governor of Yaozhou)
I agreed to help build the canal

580
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,940
only as a temporary move.

581
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,530
If Liangya State

582
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,330
really defeats Wei State,

583
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,980
that will be a good thing.

584
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,090
Let's wait and see.

585
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,260
(Proclamation: Liangya now
accepts Panyi's surrender.)

586
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,900
My Lord, your asthma is acting up again.

587
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,250
Shall I call for the physician?

588
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,530
Liu Yan...

589
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,700
He is dead set on mutual destruction.

590
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,180
We cannot let Shiyuan

591
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,490
get dragged into this mess.

592
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,610
Yes.

593
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,820
Young Master.

594
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,260
Shiyuan, you're back.

595
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,300
Son, you've been
guarding the border for a while.

596
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,900
You've done well.

597
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,530
It's time you came home.

598
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,610
You've been away too long.

599
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,530
I do miss you.

600
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,260
Governor, I'd like to request command

601
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,740
of a military unit.

602
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,740
Is there any unrest at the border?

603
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,260
Are you hurt, son?

604
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,100
No, it's fine.

605
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,740
So,

606
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,090
you want to reinforce Yujun?

607
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,010
Liu Yan caught us off guard.

608
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,740
I just need to help out for a few days

609
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,900
to ease Zhonglin's troubles.

610
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,820
Shiyuan!

611
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,530
Given the current situation,

612
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,690
I've held back from attacking Wei State

613
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,530
out of respect for your ties with the Weis!

614
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
As for the rest,

615
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,380
don't bring it up again.

616
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,700
Governor!

617
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
- Guards.
- Yes, My Lord.

618
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,690
Escort Young Master to his chambers.

619
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,530
You must be tired from the journey.

620
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,380
Rest in your chambers for the next few days.

621
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,860
Young master,

622
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,140
this way, please.

623
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,180
(Zhongzhou Post House, Zhongzhou)

624
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,420
My Lady, General Xue Tai has arrived.

625
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,620
My Lady,

626
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,490
the Lord of Liangya has announced

627
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,050
he has taken Panyi.

628
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,380
Our plan has succeeded.

629
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,780
Very well.

630
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,610
In that case,

631
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,820
I need Governor of Zhongzhou to meet me.

632
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,010
Zhongzhou is

633
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,210
a thousand li from Panyi.

634
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,530
Even if they gather troops,

635
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,070
their aid would be slow.

636
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,690
Who said I plan to attack Panyi?

637
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,490
What's your plan, My Lady?

638
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,780
Since Liu Yan took Panyi

639
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,860
and the Yongning Canal,

640
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,420
Wei Shao surely won't sit still.

641
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,820
The moment he moves,

642
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,010
I'll strike straight for Yujun

643
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,980
and wipe out the Wei Clan.

644
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,340
I didn't expect that to be your plan.

645
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,460
The Lord of Liangya attacks Panyi

646
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,170
to rule the realm,

647
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,380
but what I seek

648
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,610
is so much more than that.

649
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,980
I will walk over the bones of the Wei Clan,

650
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,340
wade through their blood,

651
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,010
and rise to the top, step by step.

652
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,090
The humiliation the Weis inflicted on me,

653
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,130
I shall return it in full.

654
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,300
Who's there?

655
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,380
(Yujun, Wei State)

656
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,300
Who are you?

657
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,610
My brother-in-law...

658
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,380
Young Master Ci!

659
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,460
Inform His Lordship!

660
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,220
Ci.

661
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,610
- You're awake.
- Manman.

662
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,380
My Lord.

663
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,900
I sent Wei Liang

664
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,340
to invite you and Father.

665
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,690
Why are you the only one back?

666
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,340
Xiaotao.

667
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
General Wei Liang

668
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,170
asked me to give the orchids to you.

669
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,210
General Wei Liang...

670
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
He died fighting.

671
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,420
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,380
Did you hurt your head or something?

673
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,420
He's a stand-up man.

674
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,170
You say he's dead and that's it?

675
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,740
We waited all night for you to wake up.

676
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,210
What do you do?

677
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,780
The first thing you say is
that Wei Liang's dead?

678
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,940
Can you think before you speak?

679
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,420
He has that huge shield.

680
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,940
How could he die just like that?

681
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,980
You're still alive,

682
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,820
but why isn't he?

683
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,570
Believe whatever you want.

684
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,900
I'm going to do the laundry.

685
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,260
Ci,

686
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,970
what exactly

687
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,780
do you mean by that?

688
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,890
Just say it.

689
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,050
Say it!

690
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,530
General Wei Liang

691
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
died fighting.

692
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,300
Uncle was incited by Zhang Pu

693
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,210
to ally with Liu Yan

694
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,940
and rebel against His Lordship.

695
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,900
Zhang Pu even drugged Father.

696
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,420
Now, Father is blind.

697
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,420
Uncle imprisoned me, Cousin,

698
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,980
and my nephew, and forced Bi Zhi

699
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,650
to turn against us.

700
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,490
I don't know why

701
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,170
General Wei Liang came to Kangjun

702
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,570
to see me and Father.

703
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,080
Out of fear that the truth
would come out,

704
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,610
Liu Yan ordered a siege.

705
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,380
We couldn't hold them off.

706
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
General Wei Liang fought to
get me out of there,

707
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
but he...

708
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,740
He...

709
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,460
It should've been me.

710
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,300
It should've been me.

711
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,210
Qiao Ci,

712
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,580
look at me.

713
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,780
Wei Liang went to fetch you, right?

714
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,450
Where is he now?

715
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,050
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

716
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,260
He went to Yujun.

717
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,420
Answer me. Where is he now?

718
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,050
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

719
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,740
Where is Wei Liang?

720
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,780
Where is he?

721
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,130
It should've been you.

722
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,530
Why did it have to be him?

723
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,460
Why not a Qiao?

724
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,300
Wei Xiao!

725
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,380
My Lord!

726
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,330
Reporting!

727
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,820
Liu Yan has taken Panyi with his troops.

728
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,210
Pass down my orders:

729
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,530
All troops, stay on alert.

730
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,420
Tomorrow,

731
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,420
we march on Panyi!
