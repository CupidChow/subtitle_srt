00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it true that love is the only thing that can make me live my life?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel more and more pained when I'm fighting?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I didn't get your ordinary care that I used to have

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I didn't get your ordinary care that I used to have

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I didn't get your ordinary care that I used to have

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I didn't get your ordinary care that I used to have

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm in your arms, not the wind

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm in your arms, not the wind

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm in your arms, not the wind

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only love can give me the sky and the sea

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Only love can give me the sky and the sea

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This meat is good

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This meat is good

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't eat that much

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is cooked by the kitchen

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You must eat more

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000

Invite you to watch Zhe Yao

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What do you think the male army is?

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hardest, softest, broadest

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Otherwise, you won't be allowed to stay in the female army

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's true that I'm mean

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you for your advice

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,100
Here

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's true I'm mean

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Of course amazement

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I admire you

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Greetings, grandma

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How can you order to ratt main house?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can hear that you've put it on fire

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's yellow in the room

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
odey

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,720
I want to change it to honey.

37
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,000
So that there's less smoke and light.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
Nonsense!

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Zhong Ling is working hard outside.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,560
She's just raising you here, right?

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,880
It's fine if you don't feel bad for her.

42
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,240
She's still here, taking care of the East, West, and the West.

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,800
It seems that a daughter-in-law is not as good as her mother.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,680
Her son should be the one who cares for her.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,800
Grandma, I've seen the accounts in the mansion.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,160
There's a cut in monthly rent for the house.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,680
There's no need to pay extra.

48
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
Master!

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
The maid wrote a letter to Yanzhou again.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
She didn't ask you to come.

51
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,960
I'll just take it.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
Look.

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
Auntie, Man Man is feeling sleepy and scared at night.

54
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,600
I'd like to ask you to copy the prescription for Yanzhou's tranquilizer.

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
This?

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
What's the problem?

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
No.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,360
There's a secret code here.

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,400
There's no rule for this.

60
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go.

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
There's a secret code.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll leave now.

63
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
washing hands

64
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
You can kitty-catty

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
more with the cat ым╝ыба

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,480
What are you doing?

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
It's too smoky.

68
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,360
Try this.

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
Be careful. It's hot.

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
But the fire is too strong.

71
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,160
You won't be able to sleep well at night.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,440
That's possible.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,960
Lan Jun is back.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,440
Lan Jun.

75
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,760
What are you doing?

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,480
The candles in the mansion are smoky.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
It's too smoky.

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
It's too smoky.

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,280
It's not good for your eyes

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
when you're studying at night.

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm thinking of changing a pair.

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
We're not a normal couple.

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
Just keep our relationship stable.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
Don't touch those smart kids

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
who want to take advantage of my privacy.

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,360
They're all smart

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,840
and all the people in the mansion know it.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,720
I just changed a pair of candles.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't take advantage of your privacy.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
That's the best.

91
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
These candles

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
were bought by our women's army.

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
We didn't take advantage of men's army.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll ask the accountant to send some money tomorrow.

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm a big man.

96
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,760
I need you to break the candles.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
I heard that the thin duck

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,360
is the most important thing in Weiguo.

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
But because of the history of Qiao's family,

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
it's not as good as the Qiao family.

101
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,080
Great Madam is very angry.

102
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
She asked Qiao Yu

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,880
to teach her a good lesson.

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,160
That's right.

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,160
Since she did

106
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
something that's out of the question,

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,880
her mother-in-law

108
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,160
must not tolerate her.

109
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
Besides,

110
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Zhong Lin has been married to her

111
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
for more than three months.

112
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
She's not married yet.

113
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
She's not married yet.

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
She's not married yet.

115
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
She's not married yet.

116
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
She's not married yet.

117
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640
It's been more than three months.

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
It's not a new marriage.

119
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,480
It's not a

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
treason against your mother-in-law.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
My cousin also

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
nodded to the matter of treason.

123
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,480
My aunt went to find Qiao Yu directly.

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,920
She asked her to accept the marriage

125
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
and told her to break up with her.

126
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Qiao Yu is now a loser.

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,200
Liang Da dare not refuse her.

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,520
This is Zhong Lin's marriage contract with Chu Yu.

129
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,320
It's a good day on the fifth of next month.

130
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,480
You should go and prepare for the ceremony.

131
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
This matter is important.

132
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,640
I still have to ask for your opinion.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
I dare not make a decision in private.

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
You dare not make a decision

135
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
or you don't want to accept the marriage?

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
The master of the Wei family

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
is only Zhong Lin left.

138
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Everyone in the family

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,960
is waiting for her to continue her business.

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
But you're in your infancy.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,480
How can you let our Wei family

142
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
to be open for three nights?

143
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
Then I'll be honest.

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
I've asked Nan Jun

145
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
about the marriage.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,440
He didn't agree

147
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480
with it,

148
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
not even Nan Jun's mother.

149
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,080
You...

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,520
You're using your mother and Nan Jun to pressure me again.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,040
Fine.

152
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll tell you frankly today.

153
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't think I don't know.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Zhong Lin didn't want to accept the marriage.

155
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,440
You're the one who's hiding behind it.

156
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,960
I don't want to argue with you.

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
You're the one who's hiding behind it.

158
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,640
As long as Zhong Lin accepts Chu Yu,

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,680
you can decide

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,280
other things.

161
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,040
You're smart.

162
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,520
It's true that I've been persuading Nan Jun.

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,160
You...

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,840
When I first met Nan Jun,

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
I was fooled by his man, the beggar.

166
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,360
He didn't care about the two families' feud.

167
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,280
He was just a good friend to me in the capital.

168
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
I knew

169
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,640
he was kind to everyone

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
and kind to everyone.

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Later, in Panyi,

172
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,800
he saved me from the fire.

173
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,160
At that time,

174
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,640
I swore to

175
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
spend my whole life with him.

176
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Stop talking.

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Who wants to listen to your daughter?

178
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Granny,

179
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,520
I can only blame Nan Jun for my deep love.

180
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
I really don't want to share it with others.

181
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
I can be kind to others

182
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,360
or I can be a bad person.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,800
I can't just

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
watch Granny

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,080
take the concubine for her.

186
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,920
You can punish me.

187
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,640
Even if I die,

188
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,840
I can't

189
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,960
let Zhong Shu enter my family.

190
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,240
Yue Milkmal

191
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,640
No, no!

192
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,480
Stop it!

193
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
What's up?

194
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,880
You told Mother

195
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,000
You're happy with me?

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Are you serious?

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
I just

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
wanted to satisfy your wish.

199
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,720
I had no choice.

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
You don't have to take it seriously.

201
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,200
My wish?

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,240
Aren't you afraid that your mother will blame you?

203
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,800
I just don't want Nan Jun

204
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
to do things he doesn't want to do.

205
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
As the head of the family,

206
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,920
and the head of the country,

207
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
you should make the decisions.

208
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,280
If Nan Jun wants to take the central office,

209
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
I can't stop him.

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,520
But if you don't want to,

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
I won't let anyone

212
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,080
force you to do things you don't want to do.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,080
You're good at

214
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,360
hurting people

215
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,520
but also at coaxing people.

216
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,600
I'll just take Nan Jun as complimenting me.

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,240
But you have to remember that

218
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,280
we're not a normal couple.

219
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,920
From now on, we can't...

220
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
We can't seduce you with your beauty.

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
I know.

222
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,800
That's good.

223
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,400
You can go back now.

224
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,440
Okay.

225
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
I'm so ashamed of myself.

226
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,540
How could you use this as an excuse to

227
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,200
make fun of me?

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
Chu Yu is so kind to you.

229
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,120
You should marry me.

230
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,720
Chu Yu.

231
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,200
Chu Yu will remember you.

232
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,280
He'll come back to see you in the future.

233
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Chu Yu.

234
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
Chu Yu.

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,680
Chu Yu.

236
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,760
Chu Yu.

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Chu Yu.

238
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Chu Yu.

239
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Chu Yu.

240
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Chu Yu.

241
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Chu Yu.

242
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Chu Yu.

243
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Chu Yu.

244
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
Chu Yu.

245
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Chu Yu.

246
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
After you leave,

247
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
just leave me alone.

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
I can face my mother-in-law all day.

249
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Now, with Qiao Yu,

250
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
how can I handle it alone?

251
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,760
How should I live my life?

252
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
What else can I do

253
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
in this world?

254
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Lu Ke, aunt.

255
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Chu Yu.

256
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
I know

257
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,760
it's hard for you.

258
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Now,

259
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
there's only one way left.

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
If you don't leave,

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I can't help you.

262
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I'll listen to you.

263
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Lu Ke.

264
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'll propose a toast.

265
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Mother is a fool.

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,760
She's reckless.

267
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
She's put you in a lot of trouble.

268
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll drink three cups of wine.

269
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
No, mother.

270
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Be careful.

271
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
Drink.

272
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
How many cups did I just drink?

273
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Three cups.

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Three cups?

275
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I see.

276
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Give me more.

277
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
I'm full.

278
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Eat more.

279
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Drink more.

280
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Thank you, mother.

281
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Come on.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
It's time to take medicine.

283
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
What's wrong, mother?

284
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I've had a headache these days.

285
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I asked Shiyi to get some medicine.

286
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
You're so happy today.

287
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm so happy.

288
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
I forgot to take the medicine.

289
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Come on.

290
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Do you want me to go with you?

291
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
No, no.

292
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
In the next episode

293
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Lan Jun.

294
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Lan Jun, Lan Jun.

295
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
After taking the medicine,

296
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I wanted to come here.

297
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
But I don't know why,

298
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
my head hurts more.

299
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's no use taking medicine.

300
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
You should go and have a look.

301
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Da Lu.

302
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Lan Jun.

303
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Madam.

304
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Lan Jun is here to see you.

305
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Mother.

306
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Brother Liang.

307
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Mother.

308
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Do I look good in this dress?

309
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
Brother Liang.

311
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Are you not feeling well?

312
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
How about

313
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
I help you to go in and have a rest?

314
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Go away.

315
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Go away.

316
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Brother Liang.

317
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
Put on the dress.

318
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
I want to go outside.

319
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
I can't leave here.

320
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I'll go with you.

321
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Go away.

322
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I can't go.

323
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
You can go.

324
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Brother Liang.

325
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,760
I was forced to stay here.

326
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
I just got out of the hospital.

327
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
I'm willing to suffer for you.

328
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Brother Liang, don't go.

329
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Go away.

330
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Zhong Li, where are you going?

331
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Go away!

332
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Zhong Li, Zhong Li

333
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I...

334
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
You dare to cheat on your son with an outsider?

335
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Zhong Li, Zhong Li, listen to me

336
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
What are you looking at?

337
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Nan Jun is just angry

338
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
If you say it out, I will tear your mouth apart

339
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
I will tear your mouth apart

340
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Chong Yue

341
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
Nan Jun

342
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Nan Jun

343
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
What's wrong with you?

344
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Do you need me to call the doctor for you?

345
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Don't call

346
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Don't let anyone see my bad character

347
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Give me water

348
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,760
What the master thinks is what the enemy thinks and what you think

349
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,760
I just don't want Nan Jun to do what he doesn't want to do

350
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,760
If Nan Jun wants to sell Uncle Zhou, I can't stop him

351
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
But if you don't want to, I will never let others take you away

352
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
Nan Jun

353
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,760
You can tell others what you want to tell others

354
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't want to tell you anything else

355
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Nan Jun, are you really okay?

356
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Let's call the doctor

357
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
If you call the doctor, you will be afraid of being seen by him

358
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
No

359
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Your clothes are wet

360
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Change your clothes quickly, or you will catch a cold

361
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Nan Jun

362
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I told you

363
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,760
No matter what I do to Qiao Jia, I won't let you go to the hospital

364
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Do you remember?

365
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Yes

366
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Nan Jun said

367
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Nan Jun, let me go

368
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Let me go

369
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Nan Jun

370
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Nan Jun

371
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Nan Jun, what's wrong? Are you drunk?

372
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
No, I'm still laughing

373
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
If I do something wrong, you can tell me directly

374
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,760
When I was pregnant with Yixing, Nan Jun promised me

375
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,760
He said I would give my grandfather a year of mourning

376
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry

377
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I ate something dirty at my mother's

378
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Get me some ice

379
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Grandma

380
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Get me some ice

381
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Here you are

382
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Is it enough?

383
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Enough

384
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Nan Jun

385
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Nan Jun

386
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm just standing here

387
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,760
If you have any orders, just call me

388
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
The water is boiling

389
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Water

390
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Here you are

391
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Here comes the water

392
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I'll have another cup

393
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Here

394
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
Here you are

395
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Here you are

396
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Give me my clothes

397
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Did Nan Jun's wound stay in the school?

398
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
It's all small wounds

399
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
It's nothing

400
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Is Nan Jun better?

401
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
If he's better, I'll leave first

402
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Thank you

403
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Nan Jun was cold last night

404
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Be careful with what you do

405
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Don't wake him up

406
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Yes

407
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Is Nan Jun better?

408
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I don't know what you're talking about

409
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Last night, Nan Jun's old wound re-emerged

410
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
He had a broken ice pain

411
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,760
I've already ordered the servants to boil some water

412
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
To cool Nan Jun

413
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Thank you

414
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Chong Lin

415
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,760
What happened yesterday was my fault

416
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
It's not right

417
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,760
How can a mother do something like this?

418
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
After you left last night

419
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I thought you would never let me be a mother

420
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Chong Lin

421
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
I think my mother-in-law knows about this

422
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Yes, it's all my fault

423
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
I'll go to my mother-in-law's house

424
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Let her punish me

425
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Mother, don't worry

426
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Grandmother doesn't know about this

427
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
I don't want her to know

428
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
I'll do whatever I can

429
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
But

430
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I hope you can promise me one thing

431
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Chong Lin, you say

432
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Send Zheng Shu away

433
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
Never allow him to enter the Wei family

434
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
But

435
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
I know

436
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
But

437
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Chu Yu has been by my side all these years

438
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Suddenly he wants to kill me

439
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
I'm sorry

440
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
He has been by my side all these years

441
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Suddenly he wants to send him away

442
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
He has no one to rely on

443
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Where can I send him?

444
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Chong Lin

445
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
You've been busy with business all these years

446
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
It's all Chu Yu who stays by my side and takes care of me

447
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
I didn't mean anything else

448
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,760
I just want to give him more things

449
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Let him marry a good family

450
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Thank him for all these years

451
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
For your filial piety

452
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
No, no, no

453
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
I'm begging you

454
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Three days

455
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I'll give you three days

456
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,760
I just hope you can remember this lesson

457
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Don't do such a stupid thing again

458
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,760
This is the greatest blessing for being a son

459
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Chong Lin

460
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Are you telling the truth?

461
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I dare not lie

462
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Madam, you're here

463
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Madam, you're here

464
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Grandma, how are you?

465
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
I slept today

466
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm sorry to have you wait here

467
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
You can leave

468
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Come here

469
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Sit here

470
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
I want to ask you something

471
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
I heard that last night

472
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
Chong Lin had a fight with Zhu Shi and Zheng Shu in the Eastern House

473
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
and broke the door

474
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,760
I really don't know what happened last night

475
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
You're a sensible person

476
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,760
It's not convenient for you to say something now

477
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
I'm sorry

478
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm sorry

479
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
You're a sensible person

480
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,760
It's not convenient for you to say something now

481
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
That's why I'm asking you

482
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
What happened last night?

483
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,760
I really don't know what happened

484
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Didn't you know that Chong Lin was going to get the troops in the middle of the night?

485
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
When Sun Xi was taking care of the Southern Army

486
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
he found a few more wounds on his back

487
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
He's still in the hospital

488
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
The wound on his back hasn't healed yet

489
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I think the Southern Army's soldiers are in the same wound

490
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,760
But don't worry

491
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I've told the servants to prepare more water for the Southern Army

492
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
It shouldn't be a big problem

493
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Okay, I know

494
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
You've been taking care of him all night

495
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
You've worked hard

496
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Go back and rest

497
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I'll leave now

498
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Okay

499
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Go

500
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Great Madam

501
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,760
The female army doesn't seem to know

502
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
Luckily

503
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
we know the situation from the mouth of the Eastern Mother

504
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
That's the real good talk

505
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,760
You're usually smart and eloquent

506
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,760
You don't know the key questions

507
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
If you're anxious

508
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,760
I'll make up a story to fool you

509
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
You're so eloquent

510
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Great Madam

511
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,760
The female army has fooled you

512
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,760
But I don't think you're angry

513
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
She's showing respect to Chong Lin

514
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
That's why she covered up for her mother

515
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Great Madam, don't deny it

516
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,760
You don't have to be so honest

517
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
You like the female army

518
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
I just love Wu Ji Wu

519
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,760
She cares about Chong Lin, so I care about her

520
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I really hope she and Chong Lin can be together

521
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
Yes

522
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Zhu Shi is a stupid woman

523
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,760
She's not as stupid as a young woman

524
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,760
If that clever woman had your half-heart

525
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,760
How could she be so shameless in front of her son?

526
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,760
What a loving mother and daughter-in-law

527
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Madam

528
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Madam

529
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Why are you here?

530
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,760
If you need anything, just call me

531
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
I'll be there

532
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Guards

533
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Yes

534
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Send the certificate away

535
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Don't let me see him again

536
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Madam

537
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Great Madam

538
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Please, Madam

539
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Ye Mou

540
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Great Madam

541
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Ye Mou

542
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I know you've been together for years

543
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
So you won't treat her badly

544
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I want to see him

545
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Although his parents are dead, they still have his uncle

546
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Great Madam has prepared a good marriage proposal

547
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,760
She'll find a good man to marry him

548
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Madam

549
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you satisfied?

550
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,760
I'll listen to you

551
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Madam, please help me

552
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Please help me

553
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
What's up?

554
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,760
The female soldiers are worried about the cold

555
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
I brought some medicine for you

556
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Please take care

557
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,760
What's going on in the mansion?

558
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,760
The female soldiers saw Great Madam first

559
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,760
Then she saw Madam

560
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Other maids are not aware of it

561
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
I heard that Great Madam went to the Eastern House to learn

562
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,760
She asked Madam to go to the ancestral hall for a few days

563
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I don't know what happened

564
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
It's just that Madam is angry with her grandmother

565
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
It's normal

566
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,760
I hope she can remember this time

567
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
It's not easy

568
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Your Highness

569
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
Sit down

570
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I heard that you were taught by your grandmother early in the morning

571
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Yes

572
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
But don't worry, Your Highness

573
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,760
I didn't tell grandmother about what happened last night

574
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
As for the others

575
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Even Chunniang doesn't know

576
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Let's eat

577
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Your Highness

578
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Nan Zhen

579
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Nan Zhen

580
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Are you afraid of me?

581
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
I just

582
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
I'm just worried about your wound

583
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm just worried about your wound

584
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't worry

585
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Like yesterday

586
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
I promise it won't happen again

587
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
You just can't go

588
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
You can't go

589
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I will go to Yongning to supervise in a few days

590
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Who's turn is it?

591
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm not going

592
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I can't bear to let her go

593
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Wei Xiao, go

594
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Hurry up.

595
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
What are you talking about?

596
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Are you annoying?

597
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Master, what's wrong?

598
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
They said they were going to live in the suburb again.

599
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I guess they had a fight with the female army.

600
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Did you figure out the case of the Taowu District?

601
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
The mastermind has been caught.

602
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
It will be executed in the future.

603
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
So you don't have anything to do?

604
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
We have something to do.

605
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,760
They said that the Yongning District has been repaired to the end.

606
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,760
We are discussing who will go to the tea house in a few days.

607
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
It's a small matter.

608
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
The mastermind has said

609
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
that we can pick one of us

610
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
and take the soldiers to the criminal department.

611
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Then it will be over.

612
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
It's a small matter.

613
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
What are you discussing with him?

614
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
I'll go there myself.

615
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Just go to the tea house.

616
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
You don't have to go there yourself.

617
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Stop talking nonsense.

618
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
I said I would go there myself.

619
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Yes.

620
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I want to see your smile.

621
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Even if the wind and snow are behind me.

622
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,760
No matter how many times I try to hide it, I only think about you.

623
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
The male army said they caught a cold.

624
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Why didn't they go back home for two or three days?

625
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
They should hide from me.

626
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Hide from you?

627
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
They said I had a cold.

628
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
That's quite considerate.

629
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
It's really hard for him to be a schemer.

630
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Scheming?

631
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
What scheming?

632
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Nothing.

633
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,760
I just feel that he wants to be faithful to his mother-in-law.

634
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I feel sorry for him.

635
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
You told him a few days ago.

636
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
I'm not afraid of the cold.

637
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Let him come back.

638
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Greetings, Your Majesty.

639
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
You packed so much luggage.

640
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Is there any work for the male army?

641
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
The male army is going to the banquet in a few days.

642
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I'll pack my luggage.

643
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
What's the banquet for?

644
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Yong Ningqu has repaired the palace.

645
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
It's at the end of the road.

646
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I'll send someone to walk around.

647
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
The male army is interested in this matter.

648
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
They want to go there themselves.

649
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Just take a look.

650
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Just let Wei Liang and the others go.

651
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
They want to go to the banquet.

652
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Is there anything else you want to say?

653
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
The female army was here.

654
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
But I was looking for it.

655
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
The lady said that since she went to the ancestral hall to rest.

656
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
I haven't seen the female army for a while.

657
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Please go and have a seat.

658
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Greetings, Aunt.

659
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Chu Yu has been with me for so many years.

660
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,760
If I want to send him away, I have to be polite.

661
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
If you didn't tell me in advance.

662
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,760
How could she not give me any time?

663
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Just let me send him away right away.

664
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Now you've robbed my trees.

665
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,760
You still have not had enough time.

666
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Do you want to take away my only niece?

667
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
You are so vicious.

668
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
It's all the old thief who taught you.

669
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
The grandmother asked the grandmother to go to the ancestral hall.

670
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I think the grandmother is tired.

671
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I'll leave first.

672
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
Stop.

673
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
Did I tell you to go?

674
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
If you didn't do it.

675
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Zhong Lin has already married Chu Yu.

676
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
How could it fall now?

677
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
It's not only sorry to my father and brother.

678
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
It's also sorry to my ancestors.

679
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,760
It seems that the grandmother has been in the ancestral hall for a few days.

680
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Still don't understand the grandmother's hard work.

681
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,760
How dare you dare to talk back?

682
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
It's indeed the enemy's daughter.

683
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
It's not as good as my Chu Yu.

684
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Yes.

685
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
The grandmother wanted to marry the south king first.

686
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Even if the south king refused to learn.

687
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
The grandmother still refused to give up.

688
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
Even with some dirty tricks.

689
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Now the east super is out.

690
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
The east super is out.

691
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,760
The grandmother still refused to leave the political book.

692
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Where is the face of the south king?

693
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Everyone says that the grandmother loves her son.

694
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
But in the heart of the grandmother, there was never a south king.

695
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
That ring is for the political book.

696
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
The one who sits on the box and feeds is also a political book.

697
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,760
Not only for the south king, it is also a political book.

698
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
But the south king is the master of the country.

699
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,760
The marriage should have been in the big picture.

700
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,760
The marriage was successful.

701
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
The grandmother repeatedly said that.

702
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Maybe the grandmother just doesn't want the south king to sit on the position of the master.

703
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
You are crazy.

704
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,760
I once looked at the world in a boat.

705
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,760
The cold two circles

706
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,760
In the fire of the wind

707
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,760
Like a warm and humble guest

708
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,760
The red and blue eyes

709
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,760
How can I forget it for the rest of my life?

710
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:39,760
I am willing to paint the wind and moon that do not disobey you

711
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:50,240
Waiting for the white and white

712
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,760
I am willing to paint the smile that is like a fox

713
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Even if the wind and snow are after the star

714
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,760
No matter how much I don't know, I just miss you for this life

715
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,760
I am willing to paint the wind and moon that do not disobey you

716
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,760
I am willing to paint the wind and moon that do not disobey you

717
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,760
Waiting for the white and white

718
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Jiangnan words are not lost in your eyebrows

719
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,760
The heart is sad and the heart is sad

720
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,760
I am willing to paint the smile that is like a fox

721
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
Even if the wind and snow are after the star

722
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,760
No matter how much I don't know, I just miss you for this life

723
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:54,760
I am willing to paint the wind and snow that do not disobey you
