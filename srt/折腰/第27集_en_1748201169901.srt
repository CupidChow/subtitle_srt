Why are you here?

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Your time should stop first,

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,000
then you'll forgive.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800

The emperor cried for her to forget her beloved.

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,140
I should tell the emperor

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,740
to automatically give之前 nameamposums.

49
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,380

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,260
to have loved each other in the generations of ages.

52
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,380
Can't you go to theheimarsis?

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,380
There is no point when I decide

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,120
how much you'd Breakfast

55
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,240
but to which this mind is hard to grasp

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,340
If

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
all the world's meaning

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,380
Tell me, do you have any expectations?

63

As you wish.

68
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,580
Yanzhulanshan.

69
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,860
Let me tell you what happened.

70
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,180
At the critical time

71
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,300
your daughter will be her court rehearser.

72
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,660
No whole court will игres weaponsa music,

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,420
clad in jewelry and finger rings.

74
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,620
You should also

75
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,880
have statused and

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,240

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,140
information around

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,880
women.

79
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,880
Let's start talking.

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,580
pronounced

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
This becomes

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,220
The third issue that

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,340
for each subject

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,300
you can be

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,780

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,620
Shиquan.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,420
You are here.

88
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,700
There's nothing I can do now.

89
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Shixiong.

90
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,740
What's all this?

91
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,700
Last night,

92
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,300

follow you

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,420
After all you've done

97
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,980
Let me soak more

98
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,220
Pause

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,220
graduates

100
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,460
But what about you?

101
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,680
You, I can't take it anymore.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,020
Wei Young,

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,940
direct this to K strawberry.

104
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
That's your fate.

105
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,260
See?

106
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,060
Look at me.

107
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,700
Mr. rendered

108
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,580
Meiji

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
look how long can it last

110
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,200
is there another one

111
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,940
I think it's our planet

112
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,160
it looks good

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,540
we can choose again

114
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,220
these are not bad

115
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,040
have a look

116
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,660
it is

117
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,020
let's choose one more

118
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
I think it's suitable for you.

119
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Madam.

120
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Sir, you're here.

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
I've prepared it for you.

122
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Wait a moment.

123
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
It's pretty.

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Did you hear that?

125
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
The days before the army

126
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
scattered all the machines at home.

127
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
The army has been transferred?

128
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Maybe it's because of

129
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
the girl from the royal family.

130
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
She's in a bad mood for her family.

131
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
If that's the case,

132
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
why didn't Lan Yun go back to the House of Luo?

133
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
No.

134
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
The wild chicken is the wild chicken.

135
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Even if it's flying up the wing,

136
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
it won't be a phoenix.

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Sir, your stuff is ready.

138
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Here.

139
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Thank you, madam.

140
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Sir, take care.

141
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,020
They're talking about food?

142
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Yes.

143
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
All the machines in the house

144
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
have been transferred?

145
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
They're all dying to go.

146
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
What a big growth.

147
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,020
What a big growth?

148
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
Interesting.

149
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
You're here.

150
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
The army has been in the study for a day.

151
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
I think it's because of the worries of the change.

152
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Even if we're busy,

153
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
we can't ruin her health.

154
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,020
I asked the kitchen to make some nodules.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
I'm not hungry now.

156
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Don't worry.

157
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm fine.

158
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
It's the way to solve the problem.

159
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
I know that the men's army will be able to do it.

160
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
There are so many difficulties in the county.

161
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
Everyone is coming here.

162
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Besides, you have me,

163
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Mr. Gongsun,

164
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,020
and Yan Zhou's order.

165
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
We can't solve the problem of the change.

166
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Do you want to eat the dessert from the restaurant?

167
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Aren't the men's army busy?

168
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Not only the army.

169
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I heard from Wei Liang that

170
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
there's a shop that sells delicious desserts.

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
I'll go and sell them for you.

172
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,020
Okay?

173
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Okay.

174
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Mr. Gongsun,

175
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
Mr. Gongsun.

179
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
Why are you waiting for me?

180
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Mr. Gongsun,

181
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
my name is Lan Yun.

182
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
I'm from the Wei's army.

183
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
I know you.

184
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Why do you want to see me?

185
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
I came here today

186
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
because I have something to tell you.

187
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Your brother, Wei's army,

188
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
he's not good to the female army.

189
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
What?

190
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
The army is not here today.

191
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Please wait here.

192
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
Zhou Lin,

193
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,020
the woman you adopted

194
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
is also a person's nature.

195
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
You think she's good.

196
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Others think she's good too.

197
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
But if someone

198
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,020
tries to find out what you think,

199
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
what will you do?

200
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
It's probably the sweet potato.

201
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
Hurry up.

202
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Let's go.

203
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
Hurry up.

204
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Hurry up.

205
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
Hurry up.

206
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
Hurry up.

207
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Hurry up.

208
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
Hurry up.

209
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,440
Gu will live even more haven't died!

210
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Zhong Li

211
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,120
Xichen

212
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,740
Actually my way

213
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,760
prefer to follow my order

214
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,920
You may speak

215
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,740
Mo àsom

216
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,520
How come he...

217
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,740
Why did you kill so manyly?

218
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,920
Then let me teach others harvest.

219
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,920
I'll finish them soon.

220
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,040
Got it?

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,560
Then then

222
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,700
Yes.

223
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes.

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Your Highness.

225
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,580
Where's the femaleicate King?

226
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,300
He is in the greatest chamber in the House of Tai.

227
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,040
We'll be back in a second.

228
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,180
Housheng.

229
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,540
Hope you meet Hai Zhang in person.

230
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,740
Thanks.

231
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,700
Hey.

232
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,500
These are big pillows.

233
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
They are socks for you.

234
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,900
Where are you carrying them?

235
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,580
What is this written on your back?

236
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,540
Where's the third one?

237
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,340
Nan Jun, calm down.

238
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,900
You can go down first.

239
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,860
Yes.

240
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,420
Don't go.

241
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
Just go away.

242
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,100
Nan Jun

243
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,660
did something bad this time.

244
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,020
Just pretend to be a replied man.

245
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,380
Between the boxes,

246
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,780
you only have me as your love.

247
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,340
Yes.

248
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,500
Then why

249
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,540
would another man pass on your stuff?

250
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Gao Heng has been gone for days.

251
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Besides,

252
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
he didn't bring me anything.

253
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
I said it's not Gao Heng.

254
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
I don't know any other men in the prison.

255
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
Where is this?

256
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
This is the item

257
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
that was buried in the prison

258
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
in the age of three.

259
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
He's not an outsider.

260
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,580
You're going to win me over?

261
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,580
All men in this world

262
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
can think the same way as me

263
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
to help me get you,

264
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
but he can't.

265
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,580
If other men dare to approach you,

266
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,580
I'll kill him without hesitation.

267
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
Even if the reputation is bad,

268
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
at least he's a man of dignity.

269
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Even if he has other thoughts,

270
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
that's his own way of thinking.

271
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Why are you pretending to be a man?

272
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
I'm just a man.

273
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,580
I can see it through all the men in Wei's family.

274
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm not a man.

275
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
I can see it through all the men in Wei's family.

276
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Mi Jun.

277
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Mi Jun.

278
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
The man's eyes are red.

279
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
The man is out there

280
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,580
to avoid things that can't be met.

281
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
It's not good to go back home.

282
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,580
But his heart is soft.

283
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
He's not against Mi Jun.

284
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
I'm sorry.

286
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I'm sorry.

290
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,580
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Why did you send so many people out?

295
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
You're sleeping.

296
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
You're not even moving.

297
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
One day,

298
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
I was eating and watching

299
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
the whole family.

300
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
What's wrong with your mouth?

301
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
What are you looking at?

302
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
Master.

303
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
The border patrol is here.

304
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
I'd like to take a look at the passage.

305
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
Actually,

306
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,580
if the water system in the border patrol

307
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,580
is more convenient than taking a look at the passage from Liangya.

308
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
It's not easy to get along with the border patrol.

309
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
Why did he take the initiative to take the lead?

310
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,580
He wants to send Chuwei's army to the border.

311
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
He wants to go to the border.

312
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,580
The border patrol thief should have his hands.

313
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Send my order.

314
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Get the border patrol's commander right away.

315
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
Get him out of there

316
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,580
and get him out of there.

317
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,580
Master.

318
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,580
The border patrol is here.

319
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
You've done your best to defend the border patrol.

320
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,580
Where's the other one?

321
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Who are you?

322
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Chen Lian from Yanzhou.

323
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm leaving.

324
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
Tell me

325
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
if you promise to return to the border patrol.

326
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Let's go.

327
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
I don't know.

328
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,580
I don't know.

329
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,580
I can't understand.

330
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
Do you promise to go back to the palace?

331
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Zhong Ling, I want to ask you something.

332
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Answer me first.

333
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
You know it, right?

334
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,580
I don't know.

335
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
Why do you have to be so selfish?

336
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Zhong Ling, I admit that

337
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
I'm a heartless person.

338
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Have you ever treated me like a brother?

339
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
I have.

340
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Okay, you have to promise me

341
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
to take this love pill from now on.

342
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Even if this happens,

343
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
I will never be in this situation.

344
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Never.

345
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I don't want you to pity me.

346
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
Every time, I will be the one to blame.

347
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,580
You and your grandmother only protect me.

348
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,580
You have done me a great favor.

349
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Yes, the protection of Jin Xiao Shen Wei.

350
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
We are family.

351
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
I'm not a guest.

352
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Sometimes, I hope you can

353
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
scold me and even beat me.

354
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,580
Your care and care for Jin Xiao Shen Wei

355
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,580
will only make me think that I'm a dog.

356
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
No one has ever thought of that.

357
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,580
I've been a brother to you for so many years.

358
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
I'm really loyal to you.

359
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
I'm really loyal to you.

360
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Don't you understand?

361
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Brother.

362
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
I've said that you must not be a brother

363
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
no matter what time it is.

364
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,580
We only hope that you don't leave here.

365
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
Don't turn into their own contact.

366
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,580
I've said what I should say.

367
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
How can I stop you?

368
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
I'm choosing you.

369
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Brother.

370
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
Brother.

371
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Your eyes are not comfortable anymore.

372
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Close your eyes.

373
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Don't be mad.

374
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Look at my face.

375
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
I've beaten my cousin today.

376
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
I was beaten to this size.

377
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,580
I'm not a brother.

378
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I'm a brother.

379
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm a brother.

380
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
I'm a brother.

381
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,580
I'm a brother.

382
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
I was beaten to this size.

383
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,580
What's your brother's problem?

384
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
What does it have to do with me?

385
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,580
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,580
I shouldn't have been a slave to you that day.

387
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
I know that you've worked hard

388
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,580
to arrange Zhou Xuan.

389
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,580
And you took care of him like a family.

390
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,580
It's all for me and my grandmother.

391
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,580
I know that you have no other thoughts than him.

392
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
But I was angry that day.

393
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,580
So I said those words.

394
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Don't be angry.

395
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,580
Then...

396
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Don't be angry.

397
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
You can beat me.

398
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,580
I can scold you.

399
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,580
I'm angry.

400
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,580
You've been training your skin and muscles everyday.

401
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
I'll beat you.

402
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
It doesn't hurt your hands.

403
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
You can say it.

404
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
I'll beat myself.

405
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,580
That's enough.

406
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,580
You'll blame me if you get a heart attack.

407
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,580
It hurts.

408
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,580
It hurts.

409
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,580
It hurts so much.

410
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I didn't touch you.

411
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,580
But don't let my mother and I know about this.

412
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
Let them have a heart attack.

413
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,580
I understand.

414
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,580
As long as you agree with me,

415
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I'll be willing to bear any problem with you.

416
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I'm willing to bear it with you.

417
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,580
Then don't be angry.

418
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
It doesn't hurt?

419
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
It hurts.

420
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,580
But I have to hug you for a while.

421
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,580
Why did Zhong Ling and Shi Yuan fight?

422
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
I heard that yesterday,

423
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,580
the South Army accidentally set fire to the main fire

424
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,580
and burned the city's military study.

425
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,580
They fought at home today.

426
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Maybe it's a game between the two of them.

427
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
There must be a reason for this.

428
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Go to the small pond.

429
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Go to the small pond.

430
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Go to the small pond.

431
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Go to the small pond and find the pearl power.

432
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,580
I want to ask you what's going on.

433
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Yes.

434
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
Greetings, grandmother.

435
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
How did you get hurt?

436
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,580
I fell accidentally.

437
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
It's okay.

438
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
It's all the State of Wei.

439
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,580
You didn't pay attention to the situation.

440
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
I'm right.

441
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,580
Where's Shi Yuan?

442
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
He went to ask for help.

443
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Grandmother thought of me.

444
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
It's so early in the morning.

445
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,580
She saw you were late.

446
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,580
So she sent someone to get you here.

447
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,580
What's wrong with your face?

448
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,580
I drank last night.

449
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
I fell accidentally.

450
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,580
You're all grown up.

451
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,580
You're all in a bad shape.

452
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
Yes.

453
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I heard Shi Yuan's house was burned.

454
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Grandmother.

455
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
It's my fault.

456
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
I went to the mansion that day.

457
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I accidentally bumped into the pig's leg.

458
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
That's why I was so angry.

459
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,580
But I've discussed it with you.

460
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
I had the chance to take the opportunity

461
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,580
to take care of the mansion.

462
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm sorry.

463
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,580
No need.

464
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,580
It's nothing.

465
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
Just do it yourself.

466
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,580
You're really a brother.

467
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Just like the eldest sister and brother

468
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
in my home.

469
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,580
Even if there are some problems,

470
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,580
I won't be in your heart.

471
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
Yes.

472
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
I've known my brother for 20 years.

473
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
I've never been in a dilemma.

474
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Xiaoxiu.

475
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,580
After the house was renovated,

476
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I'll consider it as something

477
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,580
that never happened.

478
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,580
We're still brothers.

479
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Say it.

480
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Yes.

481
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
We're brothers.

482
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,580
We never had this.

483
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,580
They renovated the house for you.

484
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,580
They didn't need to tell you.

485
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,580
But you can't love too much.

486
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Suohua said,

487
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
friends are not allowed to be together.

488
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
Although I love you,

489
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,580
I always make you feel guilty.

490
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Are you blaming me?

491
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
I'm the eldest brother.

492
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
He's the younger brother.

493
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
I should be.

494
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,580
It's good that you understand.

495
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
The most precious feeling in the world,

496
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
it's not only about men and women.

497
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I'm also a fighter.

498
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm also a fighter.

499
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm also a fighter.

500
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
I'm also a fighter.

501
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
I'm also a fighter.

502
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,580
I'm also a fighter.

503
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
I'm also a fighter.

504
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Never seen such a good horse.

505
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
For the brothers,

506
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
we're both rich and weak.

507
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
None of them is as good as Yanzhou.

508
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,580
If you like it,

509
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,580
you can ride it.

510
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,580
I won't ride it.

511
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,580
You're elder, so you're not bad.

512
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
I owe it to the horse company.

513
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,820
Let's go and have a look.

514
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,380
Remember that I am stupid.

515
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,860
Second Brother.

516
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,020
You've been living here regularly,

517
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,420
do you feel the same?

518
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,900
I am into that business place at Lu Li dates.

519
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,020
Like my grandfather.

520
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,740
My entire world is divided between him and me.

521
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,820
I've been a little injured.

522
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,700
Now, I'm not feeling well.

523
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm still thinking

524
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,940
about sister still bearing grudge

525
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,200
to myself according to a祖父.

526
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,540
She said

527
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,260
if people know about this,

528
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
I'll be home late at night.

529
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,500
You've become more and more daring.

530
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,000
So...

531
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,380
are you feeling better?

532
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,840
She's fine.

533
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,540
遺izable with her.

534
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,820
Can she bring it up

535
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,140
in theattack social gathering?

536
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,380
I heard that...

537
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,060
there's no time to send letters.

538
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,860
But no matter how many times, I don't know.

539
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,260
But this time, I went to Yu Jun

540
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,540
and met my brother-in-law, Wei Shi Jun.

541
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,180
He said I'm a young hero.

542
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,500
He...

543
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,340
Enough, Ci.

544
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
You go to the car and clean up.

545
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,820
Pack up your luggage first.

546
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,940
We'll have dinner later.

547
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,740
The First Lady of Lan Yun's Mansion

548
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,780
Sister.

549
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,980
How's the thing I told you to do?

550
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,820
Lan Yun went to find Wei Hao in the first season.

551
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,460
He knew about the situation.

552
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,420
But he didn't blame the maids.

553
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,780
Sister.

554
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm afraid your plan is not working.

555
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,460
Their marriage

556
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,300
is a matter of time.

557
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,260
If I don't marry him,

558
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,340
I'll be in heaven.

559
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,300
Wei Shi Jun has someone he likes.

560
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,220
Shi Jun.

561
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,380
He likes this.

562
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,620
He must like that.

563
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,020
Everyone in the world has a relationship with him.

564
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,580
This time, it's different.

565
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,460
The person he likes

566
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,020
is our daughter-in-law.

567
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,940
His real sister.

568
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,940
Shi Jun.

569
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,460
Shi Jun.

570
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,380
Look.

571
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,660
How can I trouble you with such a small thing?

572
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,980
Why don't I go to the First Lady of Lan Yun's Mansion?

573
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,860
No need.

574
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,540
I'll go to her personally.

575
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,100
I can also visit the maids.

576
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,820
You won't be late tomorrow.

577
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,900
I'll go.

578
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,340
What's wrong with you today?

579
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,180
Why did you stop me?

580
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,340
Well...

581
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,620
Tell me.

582
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,620
Shi Jun.

583
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,540
There are rumors out there.

584
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,420
You'd better not go out.

585
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,620
When did I ever get to know about these rumors?

586
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,460
Shi Jun.

587
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,780
It's about you.

588
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,260
You're a little bit selfish.

589
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
But don't worry.

590
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,180
I'll send people to

591
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,500
watch all the rumors

592
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,500
and find out the truth.

593
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,900
It'll be fine in a few days.

594
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,060
The rumors are like water.

595
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,380
It's not as bitter as the books.

596
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,540
Some things,

597
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,420
the more you're afraid of them,

598
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,940
the more they think

599
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,500
they know the truth.

600
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,940
It's been a long time.

601
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,820
It's become true.

602
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,340
So...

603
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,100
What Shi Jun meant was...

604
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,820
Just go over it.

605
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,660
Only by looking at it can you keep your word.

606
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,340
By the way, I'm going back.

607
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,580
I don't want to mention the cooperation and repair area.

608
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,500
I also want to spread rumors

609
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,940
and make my brother and sister

610
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,420
leave the country.

611
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,980
How do you know

612
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,540
it's by looking at it?

613
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,540
Because it must be by looking at it.

614
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,740
By looking at it?

615
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,380
By using this way to look at it?

616
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,980
I heard that

617
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,700
there's a weapon next to Shi Jun.

618
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,140
Shi Jun

619
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,260
usually makes the weapon

620
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,700
into a female soldier.

621
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,860
He's helping her

622
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,540
to make a song.

623
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,180
Does he want the weapon to be a female soldier

624
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,300
or a female soldier to be a weapon?

625
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,140
How about

626
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,980
his facial expression?

627
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,980
How could he do that?

628
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,740
I bow to the young master.

629
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,620
As long as you promise to help me do something,

630
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,940
I'll be with you.

631
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,380
Okay.

632
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,900
Recently, there's a rumor in the city that...

633
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,380
Forget it.

634
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,700
Don't make any more noise.

635
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,260
Yes.

636
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,540
We'll stop talking about it

637
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,740
in a few days.

638
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,860
Bai Zumu.

639
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,380
Shi Yuan.

640
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,780
Be quiet.

641
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,700
I brought you a delicious snack.

642
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,660
Why did you come to find me snacks tonight?

643
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,580
Is there something to say?

644
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,420
I heard something.

645
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,460
I heard

646
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,980
the控头風景 is unique.

647
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,860
Shuangshan.

648
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,540
It's very close to the edge of the table.

649
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,140
Yes.

650
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,180
Since I've been staying in Yu Jun,

651
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,020
I've been staying in Yu Jun,

652
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,140
you know me well.

653
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,980
I'm not good at staying here.

654
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,860
How can I stay here for so long?

655
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,980
If you're like a bird,

656
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,140
it's fine to go back in the spring.

657
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,660
Don't go back to Liu Shui.

658
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,380
It's a good thing.

659
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,140
You…

660
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,500
Don't go back.

661
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,620
Perhaps,

662
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,540
if my wifebles of Liu Shui

663
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,660
are a mental harm to our people,

664
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,020
if my wife couldn't even cover all who are living here,

665
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,140
who's qualified to be a family member?

666
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,820
I don't want to ruin Uncle's honour

667
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,740
and the intention of sister-in-law.

668
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,980
I can't bear to leave you.

669
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,980
I won't allow you to leave.

670
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,980
I'll leave you.

671
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
But this is not your fault, Shi Yuan.

672
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm sorry.

673
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Maybe I can get rid of the knot after I leave.

674
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
I can't let go of my happiness

675
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,980
in front of others and in front of the world.

676
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
I'm sorry.

677
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,980
There's always a time when you're in the past.

678
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Shi Yuan came back in a difficult time.

679
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,980
But my heart is still here.

680
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Bai Song Mo, take care.

681
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Shi Yuan!

682
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
What a nonsense!

683
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Send my spirit down.

684
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,980
You must find out this rumor.

685
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
Yes.

686
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
Marquis Wei.

687
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
I heard something.

688
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,980
I don't know if I should tell you.

689
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Now,

690
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,980
there are rumors about you and Shi Yuan everywhere.

691
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,980
I believe you can't say anything

692
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,980
without a word.

693
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,980
But this rumor is not true.

694
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Is it...

695
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
What is it?

696
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
What is it?

697
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,980
Is it that you're sending her out of the city

698
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,980
and forcing her to go to the capital?

699
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
The female army was invaded by someone.

700
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
She was killed by three people.

701
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,980
Why should I drive her out of the city?

702
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Now, she's the female army as Wei State.

703
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
As my wife,

704
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
she's been robbed of her water.

705
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
The one who was invaded

706
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
should be driven out of the city.

707
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,980
If I find out who she is,

708
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
I'll be sure to be responsible.

709
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,980
That's the female army that was invaded by Wei State.

710
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
It's not just the female army.

711
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
It's true.

712
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Nonsense.

713
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Catch her.

714
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Catch her.

715
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Master.

716
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Shi Jun.

717
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
The three-legged-legged-man is caught.

718
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
It's the spy of the border.

719
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Why is Shi Jun here

720
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,980
in the city?

721
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
He wants to let these people go.

722
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Shi Jun is protecting these two border guards.

723
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
What's the plot?

724
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
You want to protect the border guards?

725
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
I feel strange when

726
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,980
the border guards mention cooperation.

727
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Why do they want Shi Jun to be the hostage?

728
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Is Shi Jun and the border guards

729
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
having any connections?

730
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
I'm just saying.

731
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
I'm just saying.

732
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
I'd better tell you.

733
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
I've been to Banzhou before.

734
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,980
Shi Jun is always unreasonable.

735
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
But he doesn't know

736
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
whether he's a member of Wei State

737
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
or a Banzhou person.

738
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
I'm taking them away today.

739
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Let's see who dares to stop them.

740
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Stop.

741
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
Master.

742
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Brother.

743
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
You're here.

744
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,980
I'd better tell everyone

745
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
why I want to protect the border guards.

746
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Why do they want me to be the hostage?

747
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Am I a member of Wei State

748
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
or a Banzhou person?

749
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Put these two away.

750
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
Yes.

751
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
No matter who you are,

752
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
you're all my cousin.

753
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
But in this world,

754
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,980
you shouldn't have

755
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
the expression of your sister.

756
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,980
The Moonlight is like a sea of smoke,

757
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
but there's no love.

758
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,980
How can I be like a dream

759
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,980
that's still burning?

760
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,980
It's like a dream that's still burning.

761
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
It's like a dream that's still burning.

762
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
It's like a dream that's still burning.

763
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,980
It's like a dream that's still burning.

764
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
Through the years,

765
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:57,980
but time says no one must beì

766
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,980
their own停 think no why thirsty

767
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,700
quite depends on

768
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,220
a never-ending know equivalency

769
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:48,100
Let it not be the image of the Treasures in your eyes

770
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,980
Cuttering the twinkling of your eyes

771
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,060
Even though life is running out of control

772
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,780
Too many のがよくパ� つない 再渡不信

773
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Theseasted thoughts and untold Trough the tears

774
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:19,220
I'm willing to cross the mountains to reach you

775
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,220
Waiting for your hand to reach out

776
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,220
The words of the south are not in your eyes

777
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,220
My heart is burning

778
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I'm really trying to ignore your smile

779
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,220
Even if the sound of your voice is a wind sound

780
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Then let's live through this missing year

781
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:53,220
Not need to forget
