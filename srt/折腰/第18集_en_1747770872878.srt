2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Could it be that love is what I've been waiting for?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why do I feel so lonely?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't get your ordinary care.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Why do I feel so lonely?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't get your ordinary care.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'd rather fall back.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you're not in my arms,

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll cross the vast sea of obstacles.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be a man of my word.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Only love can give me the light of the sky.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
To be your hero.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Even if it's two things, I won't agree.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Song Nü Jun.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll take my leave.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Qiao Nü and her friends came out of the mansion.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They went to the jewelry shop.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They said they were making a set of gold and silver jewelry for the wedding.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell Yuan Wang to come and see me.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

The Legend of Chusen

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
General, why did you call me here?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I got a chessboard and a wedding headband.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please have a look.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is it similar to Qiao Nü and Xu Nuo Nü?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
General, you really misunderstood.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The female army came to my mansion to propose to Qiao Nü.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But I kept our promise.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I never agreed or made a promise.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're just a fool.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Even if it doesn't work today,

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
there's still gold and silver that will be sent out at night.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't think you'll refuse.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Gold and silver sent out at night?

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you mean?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
General, stop acting.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've sent people to watch you outside your mansion day and night.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've already seen you two clearly.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You!

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You sent people to watch me?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've never betrayed you.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But you don't want to watch me like this.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is this your sincerity of cooperation?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't forget that it's my army that's helping Rong Jun

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to stabilize the situation in your family.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Joke!

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Our family has been in the family for hundreds of years.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why should we rely on you?

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think you sent soldiers to help me.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You just want to suppress me.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't see it clearly.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now it's not too late to see it clearly.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It seems that you have a heart of betrayal.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think you have a bad intention.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So what?

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The Yongjun Army's army has left the gate and went to the Wei Dian.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We only need to push back a few times.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The swords we collected when we were attacked

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
are now useful.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Very good. I'll go personally later.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yuan Jun.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
My wound has healed.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know my own body.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I've been lying in bed these days.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't let me do this, you don't let me do that.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll go personally next time.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't go.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I said I was fine.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't I know my own body?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Not good.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wei Qu, you say. Am I good?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wei Qu, you say.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Is he good?

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Say.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not very good now.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come back.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How can someone send a soldier to come out personally?

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sitting in this room and working as a slave is the same.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Come on.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's going on?

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who are you?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How dare you attack on the street?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How dare you betray the general?

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What do you think?

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You don't think about your own results?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's play.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
General Wei Liang, save me.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wei Die, it's really you.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're too heavy. Look at him.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're worried about him, right?

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You almost cut me off just now.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then I have to be serious.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, you fat man, I'll remember it for you.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come on.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll help you.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What are you yelling for?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Get off me.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't run.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
General, are you okay?

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm fine.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What?

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You're covered in blood.

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's nothing. They did it.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They did it?

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's good.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you for saving my life.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If it weren't for you, I...

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I would be dead.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Uncle, who did you hit?

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who's going to kill you?

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's hard to say.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
General Wei Liang, I want to see you.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
General.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Bad news.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
General, the head of the army has publicly shown his support for the reform of the plain.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He even called on the people to join him.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Many people have agreed.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Now every household is at the door of the Liao Yanling.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
General, Yuanwang knows so many of our plans.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Will he tell Wei Shao?

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if he doesn't say it,

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wei Shao can guess it.

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It has nothing to do with me.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
All these years,

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
he doesn't want to move.

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But he doesn't dare.

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's better.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's start first.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I should have done it

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
when I was in the hall.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
General,

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it's not too late to make a decision now.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Otherwise, once the joint operation is settled,

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
we will be killed sooner or later.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There are not many people

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
who have been trained in the army.

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If there are not many people,

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
then it's just a few.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Send my order.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Call the people and set off immediately.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, General.

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Wei Shao.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When I wear the armor,

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I will fight with you.

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You...

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What's the point of putting on the seal?

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's over with one hit.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Write it down.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
From today on,

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wei Dian will not be spared.

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
All will be taken back

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
as a laborer who built the water area.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The day of construction will not be long.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you, Master.

160
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Greetings, Master.

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You have worked hard.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's hard to catch up.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now the wheat seed has been in the hands of the people.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There is also the labor of the embroidery.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The joint operation is a must.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The whole army will cooperate.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's just that this place has been dry for a long time.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The joint operation is inexperienced.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't worry.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have found the right person

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to be responsible for this.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have been working on the water for so many years.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now the Yongning Qu has been rebuilt.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It even goes all the way to Rong County.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is a great opportunity for the future generations.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The Lord and the Marquis Wei trust me so much.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will not let down my hopes.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I will do my best.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You have said it all the way.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You have participated in the construction of the Yongning Qu.

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now you are just leaving.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why are you so excited?

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't understand.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
When I was young, I always talked to my real job.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If the Yongning Qu is not just between the Pan and the capital,

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
where should it go?

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your expression reminds me of my real job.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's boring to cooperate with people like the Yongning Qu

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
who are good at the two tribes.

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Forget it.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Forget it.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I have already avoided the capital and the real job.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I haven't asked who I'm working with this time.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not picking on the Lord and the Marquis Wei.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I just want more room for demonstration.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You will know when the county magistrate arrives.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Real job?

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's go.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why are you leaving when the magistrate just arrived?

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
General, you don't know that

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't get along with this person.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You think I can get along with you?

204
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You and I swore to never meet again in this life.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If it wasn't for the Lord's supervision,

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I wouldn't have come.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Supervision me?

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's really worth it.

209
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You have done double the construction work in the new house.

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You supervise me.

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Joke. I don't want to talk to you.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
General, you really don't know that

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't get along with this person.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not that I don't cooperate with the Marquis Wei.

215
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Even if you are a good person,

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm leaving first.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What?

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What are you doing?

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Look.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Look.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not like you are asking for help.

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't talk to him.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He is all made by Qiao Clan.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
One on the mouth, one on the hand.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you want him to do something,

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
just do it.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Stop talking.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You have a bad smell when you open your mouth.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's go.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
My lords.

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Greetings, Lord.

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Greetings, Marquis Wei.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't stand on ceremony.

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Fourteen years ago,

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you two followed my grandfather

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and worked with Qiao Clan

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to repair Yongning Qu.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You drank the water from Yangshui

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to solve the drought in Wei.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
After fourteen years,

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yongning Qu was re-poured.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You two have done a great job.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But now,

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Rong Jun is in the same situation.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So I want to imitate the ancestors

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and open the land to connect with the Qu.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But it's different from before.

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Before, Yongning Qu

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
only gathered people from Yan and Wei.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because of the new capital and Rong Jun,

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they are closer to Bianzhou.

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They will definitely gather people from Bianzhou.

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This time,

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we don't separate the land

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and only for the people.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's a great blessing for the people.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I entrust this matter to you two.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I hope you two can work together

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to solve the drought in the people.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Zhong Lin.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you for your help.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We will do our best.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Master, an urgent report.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Bianzhou has been flooded.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Bianzhou's government is in action.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's dead.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Is there a woman in the car?

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
My brother and sister went back to their hometown.

269
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
They went through this.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know what you two want to do.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We can't do this, master.

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Are you two okay?

273
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We are fine.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Excuse me.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I have a question.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There are many coffins and secret searches along the way.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Did anything bad happen?

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's not a big deal.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's just under General Xue's order

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to search for the whereabouts of Madam Yue Lou.

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Madam Yue Lou?

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Find such a person and report it quickly.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
General Xue will be rewarded.

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
May I ask who is General Xue?

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Chen Pang is in the position.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
General Long Xiang of the Xue Army

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
is against General Xue Tai.

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
General Long Xiang of the Xue Army

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is against General Xue Tai.

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He is on the alert to find the whereabouts of Madam Yue.

291
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't say that.

292
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We have to continue our business.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Madam, please go on the road as soon as possible.

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you.

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's go.

296
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you, two generals.

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Sister, is this Chen Pang of the Xue Army?

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why don't we go to him?

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Maybe we can do something.

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you going to do?

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
General Xue is always loyal.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This time, he also followed Chen Xiang's order.

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He declared that protecting

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
is just to protect his reputation.

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Go with you.

306
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Bring me some water.

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I want to wipe my face.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes.

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Sister.

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sister, don't draw.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If people find out,

313
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
they will take you to the brothel.

314
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
After Bianzhou, it will be Wushan State.

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They won't be here.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Sister also knows that

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we are now in Wushan State.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We have no grudge.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We have the face to go home.

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wushan State has been a dormant city for so many years.

321
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It has given Sister many benefits.

322
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Even if we can't get a son,

323
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
we can at least

324
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
form an alliance with Bianzhou.

325
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But now that Chen Xiang is dead,

326
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Chen Pang can't bear it.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We have nothing.

328
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If the family blames us,

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
how can I explain?

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Sister, to put it in the end,

331
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
it's just a woman.

332
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's the use of drawing flowers on the ground?

333
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because I'm innocent.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Do you think I'm innocent?

335
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

336
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You came to teach me

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
when you saw me die?

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I dare not.

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Don't forget.

340
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You have been with me for many years.

341
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You still don't know

342
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
if you are the young master of the Su family.

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You should be more sober.

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We are of the same boat.

345
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
My flower shop

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is not only for myself.

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes.

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I solved a troublesome thing for Nan Jun.

349
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is there anything to add?

350
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What do you want to add?

351
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When Wei Liang proposed to Jia,

352
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
didn't he give you a gold jewel?

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I gave it to you.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
When you were sick,

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I took good care of you.

356
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I had to think about

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
how to get rid of the grudge and the position.

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I worked hard for you.

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You just gave me the gift

360
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
to give to others.

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm not a good person.

362
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You don't have to give me a gift.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Why do you lie to me?

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What do you want?

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Did Nan Jun

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
prepare something special for me?

367
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Troublesome.

368
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let me think about it.

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I...

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Master is in a good mood today.

371
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He took us to the street in person.

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm thinking about

373
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
showing you the local people.

374
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
As soldiers and masters of Wei,

375
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
we should care about them.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Master taught me.

377
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You can take some local products back.

378
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Local products?

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Who?

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The military counselor is still in the army.

381
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He's a little bit tired.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If he's a military counselor,

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
he can buy a sample for him.

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I think your grandmother

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
also likes the local products very much.

386
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then you can bring some soil gold

387
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to the Great Madam.

388
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And my cousin.

389
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He always thinks about you

390
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
when he goes out.

391
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's easy to say.

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Just bring some wine.

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Of course, there's another person.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The female army has done a lot this time.

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So we should give some rewards.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I understand.

397
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Did you buy the ones in front?

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My mother said

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
women all like sweet food.

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't buy these in Yuji.

401
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They're perfect for the female army.

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You're so smart.

403
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The jade hairpin,

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
white beads,

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and the fine and beautiful.

406
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
These three

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
can help the female army.

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So cheap.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Jewelry.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No girl doesn't like jewelry.

411
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Mr. Zhou, Xiao Tao said

412
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the female soldier is three years old.

413
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Five years old.

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There must be something wrong with the gift.

415
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You said she was ten years old when she was three.

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How can I know

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
which one she hasn't read?

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think I know what she likes.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
For you.

420
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What's this?

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
A horse.

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
A horse.

423
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
500 horses.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
A horse?

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This time,

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we have a special guest.

427
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This 500 horses is just enough.

428
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What do you think

429
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm doing all this for?

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I understand.

431
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yan Zhou is sincere with the country.

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I was too narrow-minded before.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But now,

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I see your heart.

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What do you see?

436
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You don't like horses?

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I can change it for you.

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I can change it into an weapon.

439
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Or an engineering car.

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Or a jet.

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Or a armor.

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, thanks.

443
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I like horses.

444
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Horses are good.

445
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Horses are good.

446
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I can tell

447
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you like horses.

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I do.

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Good.

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I like it.

451
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Horses are good.

452
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Horses are good.

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The Queen.

454
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Brother Dong said

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
the King gave the Queen 500 horses.

456
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Really?

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The King is generous.

458
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't understand.

459
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
How can a normal person

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
have a husband

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to give his wife a horse?

462
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Horses are practical.

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
They can be sent back to Yan Zhou.

464
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Others can't give it to them.

465
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The King gave 10 horses.

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't know if his wife is happy.

467
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
She must be happy to make a bet.

468
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But she gave it to him.

469
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Speaking of gifts,

470
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
what did Wei Liang give you?

471
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This one.

472
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Why do you mention it?

473
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Xiaotang.

474
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Calm down.

475
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is urgent.

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We should get along.

477
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Chunniang.

479
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Cook a bowl of red bean soup for me.

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes.

481
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's the gift for the Queen?

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What's the gift for the Queen?

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The King is hungry.

484
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So he prepared some desserts.

485
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What's the smell?

486
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It smells good.

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What's the smell?

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It smells good.

489
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:50,460
It's the gold and gold

490
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
of love.

491
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The red cat does not appear.

492
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The King has said

493
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
he would receive the lot.

494
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
No.

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's off snacks.

496
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's true.

497
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It looks easy to receive

498
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
a lot

499
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The weather is likeothermal

500
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
or sunny,

501
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
will be about the progress of the construction.

502
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There are so many questions?

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yes.

504
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Before the construction of the river in Yanzhou,

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
the grandfather and the uncle will observe the star

506
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and predict the weather for the next few months.

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So the construction will go smoothly.

508
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But Yang Feng never mentioned the observation of the star.

509
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Doesn't he know?

510
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The observation of the star must be

511
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the grandfather and the uncle personally.

512
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's normal that the readers don't know.

513
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's normal.

514
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Luckily,

515
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I was taught by the grandfather

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
to know the star.

517
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
How about I accompany Nanjun to observe the star tonight?

518
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay.

519
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Tonight.

520
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Wait for me at the observation table at 9 p.m.

521
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll go to you after I finish my work.

522
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Okay.

523
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Niu Jun, it's windy.

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You should wear a coat.

525
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I won't.

526
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll cover my clothes with color.

527
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Is my hair messy?

528
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
No.

529
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I told you not to wear this jade hairpin.

530
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You should wear something else.

531
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You can't see the sky.

532
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Niu Jun, don't worry.

533
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I can see it clearly.

534
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But Niu Jun and Nan Jun

535
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
have been in contact for a while.

536
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Why are you getting more and more nervous now?

537
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Nan Jun.

538
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Nan Jun.

539
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's so cold today.

540
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You don't wear much.

541
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Why are you wearing this cloak?

542
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I won't wear it.

543
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't like to wear it.

544
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You'll catch a cold.

545
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Hurry up.

546
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I really won't wear it.

547
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm not cold.

548
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Wear it.

549
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Listen to me.

550
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay.

551
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You're not cold anymore, right?

552
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm not cold.

553
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm not cold.

554
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm not cold.

555
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm not cold.

556
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm not cold.

557
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm not cold.

558
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Look at the stars.

559
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

560
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Nan Jun.

561
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Did you see that star?

562
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Which one?

563
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
That one.

564
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The brightest one.

565
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's the Purple Star.

566
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's also called Tai Yi.

567
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Nan Jun knows the Five-star String.

568
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I heard about it.

569
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The Five-star String is a change through the Five-star Act.

570
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Is there something on your mind?

571
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Nothing on my mind.

572
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's just that I...

573
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm here to...

574
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's okay.

575
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Marquis Wei.

576
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Your Majesty.

577
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Marquis Wei.

578
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Your Majesty.

579
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Didn't you say that before we set off, we need to pay attention to it?

580
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So, people who are in the capital must know about it.

581
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So that we can act accordingly.

582
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
By the way, why is the new capital magistrate here?

583
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Oh, it's really worth it.

584
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
He's the one.

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's not mention him.

586
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I wonder if Marquis Wei and Your Majesty have any advice.

587
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
About paying attention to it,

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I've known about it for many years with Qiao Kong.

589
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's great.

590
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Just now, Your Majesty mentioned the Five-star String.

591
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Do you know about it?

592
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The Five-star String is a bit short.

593
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
A bit short.

594
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This book is just more than 8,000 words.

595
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But it is an important book of research on the star.

596
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This book is divided into two parts.

597
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The first part is the String.

598
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What's wrong?

599
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think that Your Majesty is familiar with it.

600
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I won't talk about it.

601
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If Nan Jun wants to hear it,

602
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
just say it.

603
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Don't worry about me.

604
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes.

605
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Just say it.

606
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Marquis Wei,

607
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I suddenly found that this star stage has been out of service for a long time.

608
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's small and narrow.

609
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm afraid it's not convenient for three people.

610
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Two people are just right.

611
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What are you talking about?

612
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
This...

613
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Where is it narrow?

614
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Where is it narrow?

615
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I mean,

616
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the star needs to be quiet and not noisy.

617
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Two people are the best.

618
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yes.

619
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You can go back first.

620
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Mr. Fu, Mr. Fu.

621
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
What about you?

622
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You need to tell me what the five-star star means.

623
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You just said that the star is called the purple star.

624
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What is it called?

625
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What does it mean?

626
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Purple star.

627
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Purple star is also

628
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the brightest star in the sky.

629
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It's also called Taiyi.

630
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
This five-star star

631
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is a book

632
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,760
that can judge the

633
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
chest's condition.

634
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like us, we care about the mother's condition

635
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
to judge whether it is repaired or not.

636
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
How to repair it is the chest's condition.

637
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Master.

638
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Master.

639
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Master, please.

640
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Actually, I asked you to meet me today

641
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
because I want to talk to you.

642
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I want to talk to you about

643
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the things that happened

644
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
in the past.

645
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I want to talk to you about

646
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
the things that happened

647
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in the past.

648
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I want to talk to you about

649
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the things that happened in the past.

650
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Don't worry.

651
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I've told you everything.

652
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I won't make it hard for you.

653
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Thank you, master.

654
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I have one more thing to tell you.

655
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Go ahead.

656
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Two generals came to propose a marriage.

657
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I really like one of them.

658
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The General of the Wei Qu

659
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This is indeed a brave general

660
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
under my command.

661
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And he is talented.

662
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And he...

663
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Master.

664
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's not General Wei Qu.

665
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's General Wei Liang.

666
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
General Wei Liang?

667
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes.

668
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
General Wei Liang of the Wei Wu.

669
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I know General Wei Liang

670
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
is the left-hand man of Master.

671
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I'm a little girl.

672
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm not talented.

673
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We can't be of high rank.

674
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But I...

675
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But I really can't stand it.

676
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
My daughter cries every day.

677
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
She said

678
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
it's not General Wei Liang of the Wei Wu.

679
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I hope Master can give me a chance.

680
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I hope you can give me a chance.

681
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I hope you can give me a chance.

682
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I hope you can give me a chance.

683
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Master, please help me.

684
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm so worried about my daughter.

685
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I have to

686
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
discuss it with

687
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
General Wei Liang of the Wei Wu.

688
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I just need you to

689
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
ask me a question.

690
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you, Master.

691
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
No.

692
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I have to thank you.

693
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Master.

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Master, please.

695
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Let me drink it.

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Wei Liang, drink it.

697
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
What?

698
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Call me brother.

699
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You don't have a master.

700
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Don't laugh.

701
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Brother.

702
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Look at him.

703
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So accurate.

704
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Don't be angry.

705
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You didn't pick flowers.

706
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Don't ask Wei Liang.

707
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
He won't agree.

708
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
How do you know?

709
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm afraid only Nan Jun doesn't know.

710
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Why do you think

711
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
he won't agree?

712
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
If you don't believe me,

713
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
you can ask him yourself.

714
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll ask him.

715
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Good.

716
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Nan Jun and I have different opinions.

717
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's make a bet.

718
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay.

719
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
What's the bet?

720
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
If Nan Jun loses,

721
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I want you to

722
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
go to the street with me

723
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and make a bet.

724
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay.

725
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Wei Liang.

726
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Master.

727
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I have a good news.

728
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I met the lord today.

729
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He said he would marry your daughter.

730
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What?

731
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Good news.

732
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Well...

733
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
He...

734
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Are you happy?

735
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Lord.

736
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You're back.

737
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
No, no.

738
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's not good.

739
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Why not?

740
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We're not suitable.

741
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Come here.

742
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Why?

743
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What did Nan Jun say to Wei Liang?

744
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He's so sneaky.

745
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Look.

746
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Lord.

747
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I know you're doing this for me.

748
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I...

749
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm telling you.

750
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
The lord's daughter came to you.

751
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You said it's not good.

752
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I already have one person in my heart.

753
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I can't pretend to be the second one.

754
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You have someone in your heart.

755
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Who?

756
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You...

757
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you remember that day

758
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
we took Wei Liang to the Lord's Mansion to propose?

759
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yes.

760
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's for the sake of

761
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the relationship between Yuan Wang and Wei Dian.

762
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I didn't expect that.

763
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What's wrong?

764
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The lord's daughter fell in love with him.

765
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
He asked Nan Jun to give her the Wei Liang.

766
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What?

767
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But we...

768
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Yes.

769
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm doing this for your good.

770
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Your daughter is a noble lady.

771
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Listen to me.

772
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I...

773
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You need to cultivate your relationship.

774
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Him?

775
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's a good thing.

776
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It's a good thing.

777
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
If so,

778
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
should I go to ask Nan Jun

779
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
to get the marriage fixed

780
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
no matter whether Wei Liang agrees or not?

781
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Fixed?

782
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Fixed?

783
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I said it doesn't count.

784
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll go get some water.

785
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Get out of the way.

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You're going to the gate of the city.

787
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Nan Jun.

788
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Tao.

789
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Wait.

790
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm not done yet.

791
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Lord.

792
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If you really want me to be happy,

793
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
don't let me marry her.

794
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I beg you.

795
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Wait.

796
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You have to tell me why.

797
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You don't know about love.

798
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You're so arrogant.

799
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How about this?

800
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You let them do it.

801
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Come back.

802
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Come back.

803
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
How do you know

804
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
he won't agree?

805
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
There are too many things

806
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Nan Jun doesn't know.

807
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Fine.

808
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You win.

809
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Then my food.

810
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay.

811
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll go get the water.

812
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'll go get the water.

813
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Tao, let me help you.

814
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You dare not.

815
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You're the son-in-law of the lord.

816
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
How can you make such a mistake?

817
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I dare not make a mistake.

818
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You know it.

819
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You should be happy for General Wei.

820
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You can be happy for me?

821
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
No.

822
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Look.

823
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
General Wei, you're now

824
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
a great warrior.

825
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But you're just a general.

826
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If you become a daughter-in-law,

827
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
it's different.

828
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
In the future,

829
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
not only will you be a beauty,

830
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
you can enjoy the glory and wealth.

831
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm happy for you.

832
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You're not anxious at all?

833
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Why should I be anxious?

834
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What's the hurry?

835
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Let me help you.

836
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
No.

837
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Satisfied?

838
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You're getting married.

839
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Why are you here to make trouble?

840
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What are you doing?

841
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You only know the first half.

842
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Don't you know the second half?

843
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I've told the lord.

844
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I can't marry him.

845
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If I knew it was this,

846
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I wouldn't have gone to the wedding.

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
These years,

848
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
the four of us

849
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
fought against the lord

850
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
in the wind and rain.

851
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We've climbed out of the dead

852
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
so many times.

853
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We've walked all the way to today.

854
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Why are you telling me this?

855
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Okay.

856
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I won't say it.

857
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
The weapons of the four of us

858
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
are different.

859
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know that?

860
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I know.

861
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So?

862
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I know.

863
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ten years ago,

864
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the lord especially found a craftsman

865
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and made a set of gold weapons

866
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
according to the weapons we had.

867
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Mine is a small gold watch.

868
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
What I want is a pair of long and short swords.

869
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What I want is a small gold bow.

870
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What I want is a small sword.

871
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not interested in

872
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
what you guys have.

873
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
In our brother's heart,

874
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
these small weapons

875
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
are equivalent to us.

876
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Every time we go on a expedition,

877
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we will keep these small weapons.

878
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Although we are not born

879
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
on the same day,

880
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I don't think we will die

881
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
on the same day.

882
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But in the future,

883
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
even if the four of us leave

884
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and bury these weapons together,

885
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
we will always be brothers.

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So,

887
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I want to give this to you.

888
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The Moonlight

889
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The moonlight is like the deep sea,

890
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
but it is far away.

891
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Once, the west river lit up the dream

892
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and the long river crossed my finger.

893
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It gently touched my heart.

894
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's like the old days,

895
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but it's also the obsession.

896
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The blue sky is the end of the world,

897
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but it's far away.

898
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I once looked at the world,

899
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
but it's hard to understand.

900
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The wind and fire are scattered,

901
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,040
like the warm and humble

902
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and the blue sky is the end of the world.

903
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm willing to cross the sea

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to see the wind and the moon.

905
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
The light is like the first snow.

906
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The rain in Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows.

907
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I miss you.

908
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm willing to follow your smile

909
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
even if the wind and snow are gone.

910
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No matter how many times I have to go through this yearning,

911
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I'll never forget you.

912
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm willing to cross the sea to see the wind and the moon.

913
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The light is like the first snow.

914
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The rain in Jiangnan falls on your eyebrows.

915
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I miss you.

916
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm willing to follow your smile

917
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
even if the wind and snow are gone.

918
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
No matter how many times I have to go through this yearning,

919
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'll never forget you.
