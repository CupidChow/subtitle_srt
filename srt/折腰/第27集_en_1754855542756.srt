30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,210
Why

31
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,820
are you here?

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,460
Mr. Wei,

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,460
have some honeyed drink

34
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,130
to sober up.

35
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,450
I understand

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,010
your feelings now.

37
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,540
I also admire you.

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm willing to stay

39
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,170
by your side forever.

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,610
With great virtue

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,200
and extreme beauty,

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
you were born to soar like the phoenix.

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,300
Yet you're trapped in Wei

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,300
like a caged bird.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,940
The world

46
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,900
only sees your beauty

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,140
but not the pain in your heart.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,300
If

49
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,980
the world is united someday,

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,660
and you're free from this turmoil

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,740
and able to truly be yourself again,

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,820
will your heart

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,940
feel a bit more joy?

54
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Tell me.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,940
Do you long for that day?

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,820
If you do,

57
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,340
I want to help you.

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,260
If you do,

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,820
I want to help you.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,860
(The orchid from Yanzhou.)

61
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,660
(The woman Mr. Wei painted)

62
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,340
(is actually Lady Qiao.)

63
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,100
Why are you dressed like this?

64
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,660
I know

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,380
you have a goddess in your heart.

66
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,060
But the goddess is unreachable.

67
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,780
I'm willing to dress as her,

68
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,620
wearing an orchid,

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,300
just to stay by your side.

70
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,940
What do you know?

71
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,300
Last night,

72
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,580
you were drunk

73
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,500
and mistook me

74
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,380
for the Lady.

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,620
But I am willing.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,220
I'm willing

77
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,820
to dress like her

78
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,260
to stay by your side.

79
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,900
Listen carefully:

80
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,580
I'll have Zhu Quan

81
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,780
give you enough wealth

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,860
to settle comfortably elsewhere.

83
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,580
Starting today,

84
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,540
leave here.

85
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,500
Mr. Wei,

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,700
look at me.

87
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,820
The Lady is now your cousin-in-law.

88
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,180
There is no possibility

89
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,020
between you two in this life.

90
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,940
Shut up.

91
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,260
If you dare

92
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,020
leak a single word of this,

93
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,220
I'll make your life worse than death.

94
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,620
Mr. Wei.

95
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,140
(Huadian)

96
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,700
- How about this?
- Any more of these?

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,540
(Rouge)
Yes. These are our newest items.

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
The styles are all very lovely.

99
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,240
Ladies, take your time to browse.

100
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,780
These few are quite nice too.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,860
Take a look.

102
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,700
Let me pick a few more.

103
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,260
- There's more.
- This one suits you.

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,140
- Ma'am.
- Thanks.

105
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,580
- This one?
- Sir, you're here.

106
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,700
We've prepared it for you.

107
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,290
- Please wait.
- This one's pretty too.

108
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,860
Did you hear?

109
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,780
A few days ago,

110
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,820
Mr. Wei dismissed all his concubines.

111
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,060
Why the sudden change?

112
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,980
Maybe

113
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,660
he's fallen for some noble lady

114
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,940
and is keeping himself for her.

115
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,100
In that case,

116
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,220
won't Lanyun be sent
back to Luozhong Tavern?

117
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,060
Exactly.

118
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
A pheasant is still a pheasant.

119
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,620
Even if it perches high in the branches,

120
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,060
it won't become a phoenix.

121
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,180
Sir, your item is ready.

122
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,020
Here.

123
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,270
- Thank you.
- Take care.

124
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,160
I like this one.

125
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,540
Is what they said true?

126
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,380
Yes.

127
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,860
Overnight,

128
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,060
all the concubines in the mansion
were dismissed.

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,740
They were all crying,

130
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,780
unwilling to leave.

131
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,380
What a spectacle.

132
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,740
Interesting.

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,340
You're here.

134
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,900
You haven't left your study all day.

135
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,580
You must be troubled
by the route change.

136
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,500
No matter how busy you are,

137
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,020
you mustn't neglect your health.

138
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,820
I had the kitchen make some snacks.

139
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,860
I'm not hungry right now.

140
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,660
Don't worry.

141
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660
I'm fine.

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,540
There's always a solution
to every problem.

143
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,500
I know you'll figure it out.

144
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,660
You've already overcome

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,300
so many hardships alone.

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,780
Now, you have me,

147
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,300
Mr. Gongsun,

148
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,580
and the strength of Yanzhou.

149
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
How can the route issue not be solved?

150
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,620
Do you want to eat some treats
from Kangjun?

151
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,860
My Lord.

152
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,060
Aren't you busy?

153
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,740
There's no rush.

154
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,180
I heard from Wei Liang

155
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,100
that there's a shop
with delicious snacks.

156
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,900
I'll get some for you, okay?

157
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,860
Sure.

158
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,220
My Lord.

159
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,140
Whoa.

160
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,220
(Wei Mansion)

161
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,980
Why did you come out?

162
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,700
My Lord.

163
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,460
My name is Lanyun.

164
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm from Mr. Wei's mansion.

165
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,980
I know who you are.

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,140
What do you want?

167
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,860
I came today

168
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,740
to inform you of something.

169
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,420
Your cousin, Mr. Wei,

170
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,900
has shown disrespect to the Lady.

171
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,380
What?

172
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,700
Mr. Wei is not home today.

173
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,700
Please wait for a moment.

174
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,180
Zhonglin,

175
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,140
it's only natural

176
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,340
that others also admire
the woman you admire.

177
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,860
If you think she's wonderful,

178
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,340
so will others.

179
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,620
If someone

180
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
tries to force

181
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,780
their way in,

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,740
what will you do?

183
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,340
I suppose this is fate.

184
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,180
Hurry, hurry.

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,100
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Wei.

186
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,780
You're finally back.

187
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,100
Just now, the Lord came to see you.

188
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,100
While waiting in the study,

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
he accidentally knocked over a candle.

190
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,380
Luckily, no one was hurt.

191
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,820
Who was here?

192
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,360
The Lord?

193
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,260
Yes, the Lord.

194
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,820
Where's Lanyun?

195
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,700
(Wei Mansion)

196
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,540
My Lord.

197
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,300
If you tell anyone about this,

198
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,040
I will execute your entire clan.

199
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Do you understand?

200
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,060
My Lord.

201
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,820
(Wei Mansion)

202
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,900
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

203
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,480
Where is the Lady?

204
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,660
She's in Lady Xu's chamber
talking with her.

205
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
She will be back soon.

206
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
Good.

207
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,060
The Lady loves the incense warmer

208
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,340
Mr. Wei gave her last time.

209
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,220
The weather is dry.

210
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,380
Let's use it today.

211
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
Wait.

212
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,140
What incense warmer?

213
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,620
My Lord,

214
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,140
it was a gift from Mr. Wei

215
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,060
on New Year's Day.

216
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,780
(Panyi Chronicles)

217
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,140
Inside are the Lady's cherished items.

218
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,340
There's also the hairpin from you.

219
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,100
Please calm your anger.

220
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,660
You may leave.

221
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,580
Yes.

222
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,420
What's wrong with you?

223
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,060
Why take out your anger
on my makeup box?

224
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,380
This box

225
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,500
contains your treasured things?

226
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,940
Yes.

227
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,140
Why are there things

228
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,220
given by other men?

229
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,580
Gao Heng has been gone for days.

230
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Besides,
the things he gave me aren't here.

231
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,100
I'm not talking about Gao Heng.

232
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,300
I don't know any other men in Yujun.

233
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,340
What about this?

234
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,620
It was a gift from Mr. Wei

235
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,220
on New Year's Day.

236
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,940
He's family.

237
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,580
You suspect me and Mr. Wei?

238
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,380
All men in the world can try their best

239
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
to get you like me,

240
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,700
but he can't.

241
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,940
If any other man dares come near you,

242
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,780
I won't hesitate to kill him.

243
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,380
Even if Mr. Wei's reputation is poor,

244
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,500
at least he is honest.

245
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,900
If he has other thoughts,

246
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,460
that's his own business.

247
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,140
Why did you break my makeup box?

248
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
You're always so suspicious.

249
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,020
Not all men in the Wei Clan

250
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,100
am I interested in.

251
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,220
My Lady.

252
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,580
My Lady,

253
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,260
the Lord left with red eyes.

254
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,820
A man

255
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,940
can't avoid troubles outside

256
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,980
so they'd come home upset.

257
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
But his heart is still soft.

258
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,220
It's not about you.

259
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,380
(Government Office)

260
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,220
We've sent out
many envoys and lobbyists.

261
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,500
(We went to Liangya in person)
But Liu Yan is unmoved.

262
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,620
One day,

263
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,700
I'll conquer Chijun.

264
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,980
Let's see if he'll keep whining.

265
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,220
Shut your mouth.

266
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,060
What's wrong?

267
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,020
My Lord,

268
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,640
there's a letter from Bianzhou.

269
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,620
We can go through Bianzhou
to build the canal.

270
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,440
Actually,

271
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,140
(How's it going?)
if we reroute the canal

272
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,000
(The canals are beneficial)
through Bianzhou,

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,500
it'd be much easier
than going through Liangya.

274
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,700
This canal project has nothing

275
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,100
to do with Bianzhou.

276
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,180
Why would Chen Pang offer this?

277
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,900
He wants us

278
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,500
to hand over Mr. Wei as a hostage

279
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,940
and have him go to Danjun at once.

280
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,620
How dare he dream of that?

281
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,500
Send my orders:

282
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,180
Expel Bianzhou's envoys now.

283
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,040
Tell them to go back

284
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,020
to where they came from.

285
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,440
My Lord,

286
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,450
the envoys from Bianzhou

287
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,080
have visited Mr. Wei without permission.

288
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,780
Where is he?

289
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Who?

290
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,100
Chen Lie from Bianzhou.

291
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
He's long gone.

292
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,780
Tell me.

293
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,420
Did you agree to return to Bianzhou?

294
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,580
Zhonglin, I have a question.

295
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,660
Answer me first.

296
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,980
You know it, right?

297
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,940
No.

298
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,060
Why lie to yourself?

299
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,900
Zhonglin, I admit.

300
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,380
I was momentarily confused.

301
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,340
Have you ever treated me like a brother?

302
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,460
Yes.

303
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,300
Good.

304
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,840
All you have to do is promise me

305
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,500
to stop loving her from now on,

306
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,460
and this matter will be over.

307
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,180
I will treat this
as if it never happened.

308
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,660
Never happened?

309
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,860
I don't want your pity.

310
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,260
Whenever I make a mistake,

311
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,300
you and Grandmother only protect me.

312
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,420
You spoil

313
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,380
and protect me.

314
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,060
Yes, you carefully protect me.

315
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,740
We are family.

316
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm not a guest.

317
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,260
Sometimes, I wish you could

318
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,460
scold me

319
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,260
and even hit me once.

320
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,220
This kind of careful, cautious

321
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,140
protection and wariness

322
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,340
only makes me feel like a pet.

323
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,080
No one has ever thought
about it that way.

324
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,100
We've been brothers for years.

325
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,620
Can't you see

326
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,140
whether Grandmother

327
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,660
and I are sincere to you?

328
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,020
Yan.

329
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,660
As I said before,
you'll always be my cousin.

330
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,500
We're doing this

331
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,580
only because we want you to stay here,

332
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,740
not return to Bianzhou
or keep in contact with them.

333
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,860
I've said all I needed to say.

334
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,020
How you decide

335
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,560
is entirely up to you.

336
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
Give me.

337
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,780
Your eyes feel uncomfy?

338
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,540
Close them for a bit.

339
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Go away.

340
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,340
Look at my face.

341
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,020
I fought with Yan today

342
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,060
and got beaten like this.

343
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,420
This is between you and your cousin.

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,620
What does it matter to me

345
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,740
how badly beaten you got?

346
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,460
Stop.

347
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,060
Sorry.

348
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,220
That day,

349
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,660
I shouldn't have
taken my anger out on you.

350
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,660
I know it's been hard enough

351
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,020
for you to manage

352
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,260
those family affairs,

353
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,220
and you've been treating Yan

354
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,540
like family

355
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,180
for the sake of me

356
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,020
and Grandmother.

357
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,700
I understand
you have no other intentions

358
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,940
with him.

359
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,700
That day,

360
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,660
I was angry,

361
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,100
so I said those foolish things.

362
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,060
Please don't be mad anymore.

363
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,100
Well, if you're still angry,

364
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,660
go ahead and hit or scold me.

365
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,460
Just don't hurt your health.

366
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,860
You train every day.

367
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,340
Your skin's thick and tough.

368
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,210
If I hit you,

369
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,920
you won't feel it,
but my hand will hurt.

370
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
Then you decide.

371
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
I'll hit myself.

372
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,060
Enough.

373
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,740
If you get new wounds,

374
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,700
you'll blame me again.

375
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,380
Does it hurt?

376
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,940
Yes.

377
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,940
It hurts so much.

378
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,620
I haven't even touched you.

379
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,380
Don't let Grandmother

380
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,740
or Mother know about this.

381
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,180
Don't trouble them.

382
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
I understand.

383
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,140
As long as you and I are united,

384
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,500
I'm willing

385
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,380
to share any problem with you.

386
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,660
You're not mad, right?

387
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,580
Does it still hurt?

388
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,660
Yes,

389
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,860
but I need a hug for a while.

390
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,780
Why did Zhonglin and Shiyuan fight?

391
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
I heard

392
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,220
the Lord accidentally
knocked over a candle yesterday,

393
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,860
which burned Mr.Wei's study,

394
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,060
so they fought

395
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,820
at home today.

396
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,100
Maybe

397
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,980
it's just brotherly play.

398
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,580
There must be more to it.

399
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,620
Go get Tan

400
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
and Zhu Quan.

401
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,420
I want to ask

402
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,860
what really happened.

403
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,100
Yes.

404
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,300
(Wei Mansion)

405
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,260
Greetings, Grandmother.

406
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,820
How did you get that wound on your face?

407
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,020
I fell accidentally.

408
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,860
It's nothing.

409
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,740
You're already the Lord of Wei

410
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,020
but still so careless.

411
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
You're right.

412
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,100
Where is Shiyuan?

413
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,700
Someone went to fetch him.

414
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,100
Grandmother, do you miss me?

415
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,220
It's still early.

416
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,460
Grandmother sent someone to get you

417
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,780
because she knew you'd be late.

418
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,020
How did you get the wound on your face?

419
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,660
I drank last night

420
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,820
and fell.

421
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,300
You're grown-ups now.

422
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,420
Why are you both so careless?

423
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,280
Yes.

424
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,260
I heard Shiyuan's house was burned.

425
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
Grandmother,

426
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,740
I am to blame.

427
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,140
That day I went to Yan's mansion

428
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,220
and accidentally knocked over a candle,

429
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,740
which caused the disaster.

430
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,060
I have already

431
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,700
discussed it with the Lady,

432
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,280
and we will take this opportunity

433
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,580
to properly repair

434
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,740
Yan's mansion

435
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,380
as compensation.

436
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,580
No need.

437
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,540
For such a trifle,

438
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,700
I can fix it myself.

439
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,620
You're truly brothers,

440
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,860
just like Cousin and Ci to me.

441
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,940
When I was still home,

442
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,260
even if there was some friction,

443
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,340
we never held grudges.

444
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
Yes.

445
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,740
I've known Yan for 20 years,

446
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,620
and we've never had a falling out.

447
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
Yan.

448
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,860
Once the house is repaired,

449
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,340
let's pretend

450
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,340
this never happened.

451
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,380
We are still brothers.

452
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,060
What do you think?

453
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,420
Yes.

454
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,860
You're brothers.

455
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,540
Let's act

456
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,780
as if it never happened.

457
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,620
They'll fix your house.

458
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,300
You can ask for whatever you need.

459
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,900
But

460
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,820
don't take what is beloved.

461
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
As the saying goes,

462
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,540
"Don't covet a friend's wife."

463
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,420
I may spoil you,

464
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,100
but I always let you yield to Zhonglin.

465
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,180
Do you blame me?

466
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I'm the elder brother,

467
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,300
while he's the younger.

468
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,080
That's how it should be.

469
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,460
I'm glad you know that.

470
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
The most precious feelings in the world

471
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,100
are not just romantic love.

472
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,460
Of course,

473
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,580
I can move on.

474
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,940
I've never seen such a good horse.

475
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,940
Last time Wei Qu said

476
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,740
that Wei is prosperous

477
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,540
and even better than Yanzhou.

478
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,900
If you like it,

479
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,940
feel free to ride it.

480
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,620
This is your horse.

481
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
I won't ride it,

482
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,820
lest your cousin blame me.

483
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,260
I'll take it to the stable first.

484
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,300
Ci.

485
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,740
(Qiao)
You look different

486
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,300
after this trip.

487
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,980
The Deer Hunt

488
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,460
really broadened my horizons.

489
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,740
As Grandfather described,

490
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,820
heroes from everywhere gathered there.

491
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,980
Practicing martial arts with experts

492
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,260
is much more useful than training alone

493
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,100
at home for years.

494
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
Weapons are blind.

495
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,300
Did you get hurt?

496
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,380
Don't worry.

497
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,780
I just got some minor wounds,

498
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,580
and now they're mostly healed.

499
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,300
At the feast,

500
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,740
I followed Manman's instructions

501
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,340
and stole the thunder for the Qiao Clan.

502
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,580
Manman said

503
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,060
it was to show

504
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,740
that I'm the future of Yanzhou.

505
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,540
You've really grown up.

506
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,180
Then

507
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,620
how is

508
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,460
Manman?

509
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,780
She is well.

510
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,460
The Lord of Wei treats her kindly.

511
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,740
Did she mention Bi Zhi

512
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,140
at the Deer Hunt?

513
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,060
I heard

514
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,460
it was because

515
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,200
there was no time to send letters,

516
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,700
but I don't know

517
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,940
much more than that.

518
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,460
During this trip to Yujun,

519
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,740
I met Mr. Wei, the Lord's cousin.

520
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,340
He said I was a young hero.

521
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,500
- He also said...
- Enough.

522
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,820
You've had a tiring journey.

523
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,980
Go unpack first.

524
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,100
We'll eat soon.

525
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,980
(Qiao)

526
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,060
Ehuang.

527
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,020
How's the task I assigned you?

528
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,060
Lanyun went to find
the Lord of Wei as planned.

529
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,580
He knew about that

530
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,620
but didn't blame Lady Qiao.

531
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
Ehuang,

532
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,060
your plan

533
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,420
might fail.

534
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,620
Their marriage is tangled

535
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,500
with interests.

536
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,380
If they don't care,

537
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,580
I'll just add more fuel to the fire.

538
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,740
Mr. Wei

539
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,460
has someone he likes again.

540
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,380
Mr. Wei

541
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,540
is fickle

542
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,780
and never settles down.

543
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,220
Half the women in the city
are related to him.

544
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,700
Yet it's different this time.

545
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,660
The woman he likes now

546
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,140
is the Lady,

547
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,060
his cousin-in-law.

548
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,220
Mr. Wei.

549
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,780
Mr. Wei.

550
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,750
Look.

551
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,780
How can such a trifle trouble you?

552
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,100
Let me take this to Lady Xu.

553
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
No need.

554
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,740
I'll take it myself.

555
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,260
I'd like to visit her.

556
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,940
You can visit her tomorrow.

557
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,100
Let me go.

558
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,540
What's wrong with you today?

559
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,420
Why are you stopping me?

560
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,500
Well...

561
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,940
Tell me.

562
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,820
Mr. Wei,

563
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,700
there have been rumors outside lately.

564
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,620
You should avoid going out.

565
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,810
When have I ever feared rumors?

566
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,700
Mr. Wei,

567
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,900
the rumors say you have

568
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,420
an affair

569
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,380
with Lady Qiao.

570
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,980
Don't worry.

571
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,060
I'll have

572
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,660
those spreading rumors

573
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,740
all detained immediately

574
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,620
and investigated.

575
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,060
It'll pass in a few days.

576
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,300
Rumors are like water.

577
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,420
Blocking them won't help.

578
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,660
The more you threaten

579
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,580
and intimidate,

580
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,500
the more they believe

581
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,540
their version is the truth.

582
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,020
In time,

583
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,940
lies become facts.

584
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,690
So,

585
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,140
what should we do?

586
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,900
Cover it up.

587
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,060
Only that can calm rumors.

588
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,780
Bianzhou wants me to return.

589
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,020
They proposed cooperating on the canal

590
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,820
and spread rumors

591
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,200
to damage our brotherhood

592
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,620
and force me to leave Wei.

593
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,380
How do you know

594
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,860
Bianzhou is behind this?

595
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
It has to be Bianzhou.

596
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,100
Cover it up?

597
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,860
With this story?

598
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,420
I heard

599
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,940
Mr. Wei has a dancer close by.

600
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,220
Mr. Wei

601
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,900
often dresses her like the Lady

602
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,940
and has her

603
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,620
dance for him every night at home.

604
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,300
Does he have the dancer

605
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,420
dress like the Lady
or is it the other way around

606
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,420
that he has the Lady

607
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,100
secretly meet him at the mansion?

608
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
Can he really do such a thing?

609
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,980
Greetings, Young Master.

610
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,700
If you promise to help me
with something,

611
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,020
I'll go back to Bianzhou with you.

612
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,660
Alright.

613
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,080
Recently,

614
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,560
there have been rumors in the city,

615
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,480
- saying...
- Enough.

616
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,740
Don't spread this anymore.

617
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,630
Yes.

618
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,860
In a while, no one will talk about it.

619
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,980
Grandmother.

620
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,500
Shiyuan.

621
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,820
I brought you some delicious snacks.

622
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,820
It's too late for snacks.

623
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,620
You must have something to say.

624
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,580
How wise of you to see that.

625
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,660
I heard

626
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,380
the scenery at Mount Shuang is unique.

627
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,460
I want to see it for myself.

628
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,900
Mount Shuang

629
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,380
is close to Bianzhou.

630
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
Yes.

631
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,340
Since your birthday banquet,

632
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,180
I've stayed in Yujun.

633
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,260
You know me;

634
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,020
I can't stay

635
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,060
in one place for too long.

636
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,260
If you were like a bird

637
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,740
that always comes back,

638
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,180
that would be fine.

639
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,940
Don't be like flowing water

640
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,580
that never returns.

641
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,140
But what if the water runs wild

642
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,980
and hurts my family?

643
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,620
If we can't even stop water,

644
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,180
how can we still be your family?

645
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,500
I don't want to ruin
Lady Qiao's reputation,

646
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,660
hurt Zhonglin's dignity,

647
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,540
or see you caught in the middle.

648
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,260
Shiyuan,

649
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,460
I can't bear to part with you.

650
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,100
You can't leave.

651
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,060
This isn't your fault, Shiyuan.

652
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,700
Grandmother,

653
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,940
just think of it as me
going out to relax.

654
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,900
Maybe once I'm out,

655
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,740
I'll be able to let go

656
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,980
of this fixation on someone

657
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,180
and something before me

658
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,580
and move on

659
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,660
from the feelings
that I should never have.

660
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,240
A fledgling
must eventually leave the nest.

661
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,140
I may never return,

662
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,020
but my heart will always be here.

663
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,300
Grandmother,

664
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,620
take care.

665
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,380
Shiyuan!

666
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,060
What nonsense.

667
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,860
Pass down my order:

668
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,180
Find the one who started this rumor.

669
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,820
Yes.

670
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,220
My Lord,

671
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,220
I heard something,

672
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,460
but I'm unsure

673
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,620
if I should tell you.

674
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,580
Right now,

675
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,060
the city is full of rumors

676
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,700
about Lady Qiao and Shiyuan
having an affair.

677
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,900
I trust her character

678
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,460
and can't say things

679
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,180
like where there's smoke, there's fire.

680
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,780
Still,

681
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,900
rumors can be hurtful.

682
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,340
Shall we...

683
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,660
What?

684
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,540
Shall we send her
out of the city for now

685
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,260
to avoid the spotlight?

686
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,380
She's the one being slandered

687
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,420
and being gossiped about.

688
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,980
Why should I drive her out of Yujun?

689
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,500
She is the Lady of Wei

690
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
and my wife.

691
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,500
She's being slandered.

692
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,220
The ones spreading rumors

693
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,460
should be the ones cast out of Yujun.

694
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,180
If I find out who it is,

695
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,140
I will make them pay.

696
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,740
He tried every way to seduce the Lady.

697
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,580
Yeah.

698
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,700
Not just the Lady.

699
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,580
He seduced many women.

700
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,900
What an outrageous slander.

701
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,420
Arrest them, now!

702
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,260
Yes!

703
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,110
Stop!

704
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,280
Stop! Don't move!

705
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,250
Stop running! Stop!

706
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,940
My Lord.

707
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,250
Mr. Wei, please leave.

708
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,580
The rumor-spreaders were caught.

709
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,820
They're spies from Bianzhou.

710
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,420
Why the shouting?

711
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,640
Mr. Wei is here,

712
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,690
demanding they be released.

713
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,730
We won't let you take them.

714
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,860
Please leave, Mr. Wei.

715
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,580
Mr. Wei, why are you protecting

716
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,860
these two Bianzhou spies?

717
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,380
Because I want to.

718
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,940
When Bianzhou proposed a partnership,

719
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,000
I wondered

720
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,180
why they insisted Mr. Wei
be the hostage.

721
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,860
Could there be secret dealings

722
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,100
between you and Bianzhou?

723
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,260
I've never tried to hide it.

724
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,620
I might as well tell you:

725
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,620
I have been to Bianzhou on my travels.

726
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,180
You've never dealt with state affairs,

727
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,020
but surely you know

728
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,940
whether you belong

729
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,100
to Wei or Bianzhou.

730
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,860
Today, I will take them with me.

731
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,740
Don't you dare stop me.

732
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,460
Stop.

733
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,860
My Lord.

734
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,460
Yan.

735
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,300
Zhonglin, you're here.

736
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,860
You can tell everyone

737
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,860
why I'm protecting these spies,

738
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,660
why Bianzhou wants me as a hostage,

739
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,660
and whether I belong to Wei or Bianzhou.

740
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,100
Release them.

741
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

742
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,700
Wherever you belong,

743
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,260
you are always my cousin.

744
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,780
But in this world,

745
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,100
a cousin should never
love his cousin-in-law.
