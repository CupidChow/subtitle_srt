You don't have to leave.

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm going now to pack

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,830
and leave this filthy place.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
What nonsense is this?

34
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,390
Ci.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,160
- My Lord, you...
- Enough, Mr. Zhang.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't make it worse.

37
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,470
I...

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,630
You're right, My Lord.

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,400
The soil here
is well-suited for construction.

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,160
And it's close to the Yongning Canal.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,280
If we redirect the water and build the canal

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,350
with proper dams,

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,630
it can be used for irrigation.

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,280
This truly is a good place to settle.

45
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,470
Wei Liang, Wei Qu, Wei Xiao.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,730
You three,

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,350
take some men to gather timber and stone.

48
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,070
- Yes.
- Yes.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,000
Wei Duo,

50
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,190
come here.

51
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,190
Head to Panyi

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,400
and arrange the hydraulic works.

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,280
Also, bring me Yang Feng's book.

54
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,510
Yes, My Lord.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,350
Our journey will be delayed
by a few more days.

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,630
But once the displaced people are settled,

57
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,070
we'll return to Yujun.

58
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,190
Alright.

59
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,230
Your arrow wound hasn't healed yet.

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,470
You've worked hard.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,350
It's nothing serious.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,790
What matters now is helping them

63
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,880
guide the water.

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,910
I remember you once said

65
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,160
there's much to know about hydraulic works,

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
like

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,470
how weather conditions,
whether sunny or rainy,

68
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,400
cold or warm,

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,720
can affect and delay the progress.

70
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,070
Yes.

71
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,750
So, how did Yanzhou

72
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,040
forecast the weather?

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,560
We observed clouds and stars.

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,040
What a pity.

75
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,720
I don't know any of that.

76
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,440
And you, My Lady?

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
I know a little.

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
That's great.

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,560
I plan to help them rebuild their homes,

80
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,040
but I worry the work will move slowly

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,190
and delay our return.

82
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,350
This place is high in elevation,

83
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,720
better than the observatory.

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,470
My Lady, would you

85
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,230
be willing to teach me how to

86
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,600
observe the stars tonight?

87
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,750
I share your concerns, My Lord.

88
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,000
But I only know

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,910
the basics.

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm not nearly as good as Lord Yang.

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,910
How about this? Let's ask a General

92
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,350
to go invite Lord Yang here.

93
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,790
The three of us can go together.

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,750
I don't think so.

95
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,230
All my men are out on errands.

96
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,510
There's no one left to fetch him.

97
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,230
Honestly, I'm worried

98
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
I won't get it right

99
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,910
and I'll only delay your plans.

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
You've delayed me

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,230
more than enough.

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,760
What's one more thing?

103
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,060
Then I have no choice but to obey.

104
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,520
Ci.

105
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,870
Aunt, it's so late.

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,640
You're still not resting?

107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,200
I was worried you might sneak out tonight.

108
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,870
Aunt, what do you mean by that?

109
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,470
What I said earlier today

110
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,040
was just to scare Uncle.

111
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,910
How could I possibly wander off alone

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
and make everyone worry?

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,280
If you were traveling along the main road,

114
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,040
with the official letter in hand,

115
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,160
escorted by guards

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,350
heading toward Boya,

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,910
we wouldn't be so worried.

118
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,920
Come on, come on.

119
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,090
Come, eat.

120
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,380
- Slow down.
- We'll have a good life.

121
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,720
The view here is nice,

122
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,960
and it's peaceful too.

123
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,760
Yes, it is.

124
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,230
Because Yang Feng isn't here.

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
There are no stars tonight.

126
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
You changed your hairpin today.

127
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,670
You noticed that?

128
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Of course.

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,840
Yesterday, I thought you'd been abducted.

130
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,230
When I found you,

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,450
I searched you

132
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,430
from head to toe.

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,020
That hairpin you wore yesterday

134
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,100
had an orchid on it.

135
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,260
Today's doesn't.

136
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,300
Take a look at the back.

137
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,540
I just turned it around.

138
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,660
Yesterday, I was desperate to find you.

139
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,140
All my thoughts were on you.

140
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,900
It's no wonder I didn't notice.

141
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Thank you for thinking of me, My Lord.

142
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Actually,

143
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,860
when I thought you'd been abducted yesterday,

144
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,980
I was truly afraid.

145
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,980
I was afraid

146
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,780
you might suddenly

147
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,260
leave me,

148
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,740
just like Grandfather,

149
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,060
Father, and Brother did.

150
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,180
You're an exceptional lady.

151
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,700
And I have to admit,

152
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,500
I've never admired any woman
the way I admire you.

153
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,180
At first, I thought

154
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
marriage was just marriage.

155
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,660
But after spending time with you,

156
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
I started to feel something for you.

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,860
Now, I'm afraid of falling too deep

158
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,260
and regretting it later.

159
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,580
I felt the same.

160
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,660
Marriage was just marriage.

161
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,140
I didn't have many feelings
for you back then.

162
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,220
But I admire
how you care for the whole realm,

163
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,180
how you're willing to put aside the feud

164
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
between the Qiao and Wei clans
for this canal.

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,580
And now, you even
offer shelter to the displaced.

166
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,700
Great.

167
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,980
From now on,

168
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,060
we won't have to wander.

169
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,420
We can finally settle down.

170
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,700
These past few days,

171
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,780
watching them suffer,

172
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,860
I've come to truly understand

173
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,340
how the fight over water

174
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,540
has brought pain to innocent lives.

175
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,340
So, I have a wish

176
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,260
that one day, all tribes

177
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,580
might be joined by a single lifeline,

178
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,260
and the chaos may end.

179
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,180
But I don't know

180
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,020
if that wish can ever come true.

181
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,960
This is way better than how we were living

182
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,660
- The chaos has lasted too long.
- a few days ago.

183
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,900
To achieve peace and greatness,

184
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,700
sometimes war must be used to end war.

185
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,940
If Yanzhou hadn't turned them away,

186
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,020
they wouldn't have met us.

187
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,420
Are you afraid that one day,

188
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,220
you and I will stand on opposing sides?

189
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm afraid this peace

190
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
may not last long.

191
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,220
Even if peace lasts only for a moment,

192
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,660
a sincere heart can make

193
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,900
its echo last for generations.

194
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,780
I make a solemn vow

195
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,780
to follow you with the loyalty of a subject.

196
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,420
No matter what lies ahead, peace or chaos,

197
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,260
I will remain loyal to you

198
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,220
and never leave you.

199
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,820
I will stand by your side,

200
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,340
helping to complete the canal,

201
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,300
facing hardships together,

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,580
bringing water to all regions,

203
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,900
ending wars,

204
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,580
and dissolving hatred

205
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,900
with genuine sincerity,

206
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,300
to bring peace to the whole realm.

207
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,980
Why didn't you keep an eye on Ci?

208
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,580
You just let him leave like that?

209
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,380
He's grown up now.

210
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,500
He left with Lady Ding.

211
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,820
How could I stop him?

212
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,460
He's always been strong-willed

213
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,820
and hard to control.

214
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,620
A grown son can't be held back by his father.

215
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,380
If Father were still alive,

216
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,780
and forbade you from chasing after beauties,

217
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,900
would you have listened?

218
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,420
If Father couldn't rein you in,

219
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,220
how do you expect to watch over Ci?

220
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,740
How much money did he take?

221
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,300
Young Master Ci took
a fair amount of valuables,

222
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,540
enough for his needs.

223
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,620
Did he bring any good weapons?

224
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,180
He took his usual silver spear

225
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,020
and a short sword.

226
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,140
Was he escorted?

227
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,260
Yes, his personal guards went with him.

228
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,580
(Don't look for me.)
Do you know where he went?

229
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
(I'll return one day. By Qiao Ci)

230
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,940
He went to Boya, carrying an official letter

231
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,260
from the prefect.

232
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,500
Official letter?

233
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,980
So, he's not running away.

234
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,220
He's visiting relatives.

235
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,700
(Boya)

236
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,620
It's windy here.

237
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,900
Don't catch a cold.

238
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,340
Mother.

239
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,900
Ci.

240
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,260
This is our home now.

241
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,740
Fan.

242
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,140
You've suffered so much away from home.

243
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,460
If you love Bi Zhi,

244
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,780
just tell us.

245
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,100
Why leave without a word,

246
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,620
only to end up like this?

247
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Mother,

248
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,420
Bi Zhi treats me very well.

249
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm not suffering.

250
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,100
You don't need to hide it from me.

251
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,020
I'm not blaming him.

252
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm just worried about you.

253
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,500
When you were at home,

254
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,860
how could you live

255
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,620
in a place like this?

256
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,620
You didn't bring

257
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,980
your konghou from home.

258
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,780
Luckily, you found another fine one.

259
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,340
How else would you find comfort?

260
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,980
This zither

261
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,500
was custom-made for me by Bi Zhi.

262
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,780
Because of it,

263
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,660
we unexpectedly gained Boya.

264
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,460
Is that so?

265
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,380
I heard about this back in Kangjun.

266
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,100
Commander of Boya Forces overthrew Xue Tai

267
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,700
because of a carpenter.

268
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,700
I thought it was just a rumor.

269
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,580
But it seems he's been good to you.

270
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,580
Xing,

271
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,340
have those dozen or so weasels
in the yard been fed?

272
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,180
Yes.

273
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,180
Why are you raising weasels now?

274
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,340
Bi Zhi once saw Liu Yan offer

275
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,020
a weasel as a betrothal gift to Manman,

276
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,500
so he caught some for me.

277
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,050
To please me,

278
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,100
he caught over a dozen in one go.

279
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,620
Liu Yan was just going through the motions,

280
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,260
but Bi Zhi truly means it.

281
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,700
We don't really need that lynx.

282
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,020
What we lack

283
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,700
is the heart Bi Zhi showed
when he caught those weasels.

284
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,620
Mother, you are absolutely right.

285
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,580
Fan,

286
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,660
seeing you doing well

287
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,540
puts my heart at ease.

288
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,100
Mother,

289
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,460
since you came all this way,

290
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,100
why not stay here in Boya with Ci

291
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,180
and spend the New Year with us?

292
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,260
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

293
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,220
Grandmother.

294
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,420
Grandmother.

295
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,020
Zhonglin and Lady Qiao are back.

296
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,660
Grandmother.

297
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,660
How did things go

298
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,860
in Rongjun?

299
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Quite smoothly.

300
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,140
And with Yang Feng's help

301
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,380
in Panyi,

302
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,260
the canal should be well on its way.

303
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,500
That's good to hear.

304
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,340
Along the way,

305
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,380
you kept him company

306
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,540
through wind and rain.

307
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,500
Thank you for that.

308
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,420
It was nothing.

309
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,740
Everyone, have a seat.

310
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,860
Thanks, Grandmother.

311
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,180
Serve the tea.

312
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,460
Yes.

313
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,900
Zhonglin,

314
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,020
travel food's nothing like
a home-cooked meal.

315
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,060
Come to my place tomorrow.

316
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,820
I'll prepare wine and some delicacies

317
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,220
to welcome you back.

318
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
Great.

319
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,180
Is your injury healed

320
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,540
enough for alcohol?

321
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
You're injured?

322
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,240
Just a small wound,

323
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,100
nothing serious.

324
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,420
I've been up and about these days.

325
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,900
It's fine. No problem.

326
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,940
Grandmother,

327
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,380
we brought back some specialties
from Rongjun.

328
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,220
I'll go fetch them with Xiaotao.

329
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,060
Okay.

330
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,500
Zhonglin,

331
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,980
your wife cares for you

332
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,500
with great tenderness.

333
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,500
Yes,

334
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,340
Her Ladyship is very thoughtful.

335
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,140
But that only matters if it's for you.

336
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,540
Her thoughts are

337
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,100
all with the people of Wei State.

338
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,540
That's caring for all under her roof.

339
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
I think Lady Qiao

340
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,900
genuinely cares about you.

341
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Genuine or not,

342
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,940
she's just a bit clever,

343
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,740
so I listen to her sometimes.

344
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,140
I'm a noble lord.

345
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,020
How could I

346
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,860
be lost in romance every day?

347
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,820
Exactly.

348
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,380
That's the spirit of a true man.

349
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,220
Is that right?

350
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,540
Yes.

351
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,940
My Lady,

352
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,340
stay and chat with Grandmother.

353
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,980
Grandmother,

354
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,060
I've just returned.

355
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,780
I should go greet Mother.

356
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,620
I'll take my leave.

357
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Go ahead.

358
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,820
Yes.

359
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,820
Zhonglin?

360
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,020
Zhonglin?

361
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,500
Grandmother.

362
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Zhonglin!

363
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,020
Ma'am.

364
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,420
His Lordship has come to see you.

365
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,740
Zhonglin, you're here.

366
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
Mother.

367
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,540
You found time

368
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,420
to see me today, huh?

369
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,700
I brought you fruits from Rongjun

370
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,780
and some jewelry,

371
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,980
so I thought I'd visit you.

372
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
If you're busy,

373
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,220
you don't have to come see me.

374
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,420
About the wheat seeds,

375
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,580
- it's all my fault...
- Mother,

376
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
let's not

377
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,780
bring up the past.

378
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,060
Alright, not another word.

379
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,940
Have a seat.

380
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,580
Try some fruits.

381
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,420
Lady Qiao picked

382
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,220
these pieces just for you.

383
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,340
(This is way too sour.)

384
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,580
Look at this hairpin.

385
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,420
Do you like it?

386
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,420
Mother?

387
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,580
Why are you crying?

388
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,500
Please

389
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,980
don't be too upset.

390
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,140
You did make a mistake

391
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,820
with the wheat seeds,

392
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,740
but I understand,

393
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,620
you couldn't let go of Brother and Father.

394
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,260
It was my fault.

395
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,940
I blamed you in my heart

396
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,780
for always thinking of the dead

397
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,940
and ignoring me.

398
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,140
But wasn't I the same?

399
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,260
I ignored how you felt,

400
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,180
so you had to confide in others.

401
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Zhonglin,

402
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,220
I don't want you

403
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,060
caught between me and her.

404
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,740
So,

405
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,540
I accept her

406
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,340
as my daughter-in-law.

407
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,260
It's not hard for me to accept her.

408
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,460
I'm just worried about you.

409
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Lady Qiao is sharp with words.

410
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm afraid you can't take her on.

411
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,140
You're the one who needs to be
comfortable in your own life.

412
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,700
So,

413
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,220
whatever you do,

414
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
you should

415
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,460
keep her in check.

416
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,980
Don't let her get the upper hand.

417
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,740
Could it be

418
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,980
you've already fallen for her?

419
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,740
No, I haven't.

420
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,980
I'm here to visit you today.

421
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,300
Let's not talk about her.

422
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,980
See?

423
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,020
You clearly like her.

424
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,740
Try this one.

425
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,380
Does it taste good?

426
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,060
I sent some to Grandmother this morning.

427
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,180
It's so good.

428
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,100
Go on, try it.

429
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,700
Tastes good, right?

430
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,260
Mother,

431
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,340
it's too sour!

432
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,540
Anything from my son

433
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,620
tastes sweet to me.

434
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,460
Look.

435
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,620
You're back, My Lord.

436
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,980
Today, you had me

437
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,820
send those sour fruits as gifts.

438
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,860
What are you up to?

439
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,780
Are they sour?

440
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,220
Try one yourself.

441
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,020
I was spoiled growing up.

442
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,180
Back then,

443
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,460
whenever I got upset,

444
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,180
I'd run into Aunt's arms and cry,

445
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,940
telling her exactly what I wanted.

446
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,700
You're the strong-willed type.

447
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,540
I bet you never did that with Mother.

448
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,020
Mother is a straightforward person.

449
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,340
One of you has to give in first,

450
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,380
so the other can soften.

451
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,580
I do appreciate

452
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,140
how much you care for me.

453
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,100
I know I'm just a bit clever,

454
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,980
like you told Grandmother.

455
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,900
I meant it sincerely,

456
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,300
not sarcastically.

457
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,420
I know you always

458
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,380
say the opposite of what you feel.

459
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,100
You've come a long way,

460
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,020
and haven't had a break today.

461
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,860
I'll have a bath prepared for you

462
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,740
to help you unwind.

463
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,140
Alright.

464
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,580
Could it be

465
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,820
you've already fallen for her?

466
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,540
See?

467
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,580
You clearly like her.

Grandfather.

492
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,780
Father.

493
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,820
Brother.

494
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,660
Are you blaming me

495
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,180
for falling for Lady Qiao?

496
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,900
Brother!

497
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,060
(Grandmother wants me to let go of hatred)

498
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,980
(and live happily with her.)

499
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,380
(Is it even possible?)

500
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,140
(Can I really do that?)

501
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,700
(Winter)

502
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,780
(Government Hall, Wei State)

503
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,780
(Yongning)

504
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,620
This journey has brought us

505
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,500
a new city, Yongning.

506
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,340
Though its people

507
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,860
are not originally of Wei,

508
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,820
since we've taken them in,

509
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,220
we should treat them as our own.

510
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,580
Do you understand?

511
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
Yes, My Lord.

512
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,180
There are tens of thousands of people

513
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,140
suffering from the war.

514
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,220
What we've seen

515
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,820
is only the tip of the iceberg.

516
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,260
So,

517
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,620
I have a wish.

518
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
I hope you'll help me see it fulfilled.

519
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,420
I want to build canals,

520
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,020
starting from Panyi,

521
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,420
stretching far and wide,

522
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,620
reaching every region.

523
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,780
So that all people

524
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,220
will no longer fight over water.

525
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,700
They can

526
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,180
finally live in peace.

527
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,380
A wise decision, My Lord.

528
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,500
This deed

529
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,780
will benefit countless souls and lives.

530
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,620
My Lord,

531
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,740
your care for the people
shines as bright as the sun.

532
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,780
However,

533
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,940
fighting over water

534
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,100
is but a symptom.

535
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,940
The rivalries

536
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,740
between clans run deep.

537
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,020
Ending the conflict

538
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,620
won't be so easy.

539
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,860
This is the wisdom
behind His Lordship's plan.

540
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,500
Peace needs

541
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,740
both ink and arms.

542
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,140
Canal construction

543
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,420
follows the example
of the Qiao-Wei alliance,

544
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,820
a civil solution

545
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,180
to avoid bloodshed.

546
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,500
However, I fear not all factions

547
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,020
and clans will agree.

548
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,580
So, Her Ladyship and I have decided

549
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,340
to hold a Deer Hunt.

550
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,740
When the time comes,

551
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,340
we'll invite all powers to gather

552
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,860
and discuss canal construction.

553
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,180
We'll appeal to their shared interests,

554
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,340
to persuade each faction

555
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,780
to unite and work together.

556
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,180
It's not urgent yet,

557
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,460
but we must prepare in advance.

558
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,300
Sir, please

559
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,860
draft the invitation list

560
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,220
and hand it to Her Ladyship.

561
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,460
Yes.

562
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,300
Her Ladyship?

563
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,380
She just went to Rongjun, and now

564
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,060
she's handling state affairs?

565
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,540
She's family.

566
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
It won't be a problem.

567
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,220
Why didn't you go to Luozhong Tavern with me?

568
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,660
Why insist on drinking at home?

569
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,860
What noble lord just returned home

570
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,420
and heads to a tavern?

571
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,100
So, My Lord,

572
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,220
how many days before you

573
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,100
join me there?

574
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,220
That's never gonna happen.

575
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,220
Zhonglin, are you afraid of your wife?

576
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,740
Afraid of her? Me?

577
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,950
So what if you are?

579
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,460
Honestly, I envy you.

580
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,420
No one loves me

581
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,940
or truly cares for me like that.

582
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,620
You know,

583
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,180
if you want to settle down,

584
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,420
Grandmother will find you

585
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,700
the best match.

586
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,260
A good marriage

587
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,380
is never easy.

588
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,550
Some couples

589
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,860
treat each other

590
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,140
with respect and formality,

591
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,620
while others share deep affection

592
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,940
and true understanding.

593
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,940
Since you're so insightful,

594
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,460
let me ask you something.

595
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,540
Can I

596
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,420
allow myself

597
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,540
to fall for Lady Qiao?

598
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,460
You cannot.

599
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,980
The Qiao family harmed our kin.

600
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,100
We both know the pain
of losing family since childhood.

601
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,460
I know all of that.

602
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,740
But those choices were
her Grandfather's, not hers.

603
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,220
If we were in her place,

604
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,380
we'd face the same dilemma.

605
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,620
Still, she used you

606
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,460
to take Boya

607
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,180
and keep Panyi in check.

608
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,580
That's a fact, isn't it?

609
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,900
At the time, we were in a power struggle.

610
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,580
Of course, we both held back a little.

611
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,980
But now, look at her.

612
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,620
She helped me with the Yongning Canal

613
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,020
and even put Yang Feng at my service.

614
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,620
That shows she has no hidden agenda.

615
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,740
What about her family?

616
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,580
Everyone knows

617
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,180
they're as cold as ice.

618
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,260
With your temperament,

619
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,420
you'd have to burn yourself

620
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,800
just to thaw their frozen hearts.

621
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,700
You've got it wrong.

622
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,420
She's warm-hearted

623
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,380
and truly cares for me.

624
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,740
She's not as cold as you say.

625
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,380
Sounds like you can't live without her.

626
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,580
Why bother to ask me?

627
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,460
Honestly,

628
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,740
you've fallen for her,

629
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,660
but your filial piety holds you back.

630
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,460
That'll only

631
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,340
make it harder for yourself.

632
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,620
Look,

633
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,300
it spread its tail.

634
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,180
Even that bird shows more
genuine feeling than you.

635
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,020
Mr. Wei,

636
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,900
I made you some herbal sobering soup.

637
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,100
What intoxicates is not wine,

638
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,540
but love.

639
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,580
Lanyun,

640
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,940
bring me a brush.

641
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,060
Feeling inspired?

642
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,180
What do you plan to draw?

643
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,220
Have you heard the tale
of the Goddess of Yushan?

644
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,620
I...

645
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,260
My knowledge is shallow.

646
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,060
I haven't heard of it.

647
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,860
A weary scholar lost his way in deep woods.

648
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,020
He wandered into a hidden clearing,

649
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,940
where he saw the goddess at her bath.

650
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,020
She moved like drifting mist,
graceful and elusive,

651
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,900
a beauty to steal one's breath away.

652
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,620
With one sway, flowers blossomed;

653
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,940
with another, the grass withered.

654
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,140
So serene, like tiger and hare at peace,
or sun and moon in quiet grace.

655
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,100
The scholar's heart stirred.

656
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,060
He longed to go to her,

657
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,820
yet feared she'd vanish the moment he did.

658
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,540
He was torn

659
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,540
between longing and fear.

660
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,380
In love,

661
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,580
hesitation is the greatest foe.

662
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,060
The more one worries,

663
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,500
the heavier the burden,

664
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,740
until there's no freedom,

665
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,780
only knots

666
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,900
and no joy.

667
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,940
Why did you stop, Mr. Wei?

668
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,700
Without facial features,

669
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,860
this Goddess of Yushan

670
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,060
is incomplete.

671
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
There's no goddess in my heart,

672
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,420
so how could I know

673
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,820
what she looks like?

674
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,060
Honestly,

675
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,500
you've fallen for her,

676
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,620
but your filial piety holds you back.

677
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,660
That'll only

678
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
make it harder for yourself.

679
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,100
You're back, My Lord.

680
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,660
Your face is quite flushed.

681
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,460
It's nothing. I had some wine.

682
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,980
Here, warm your hands with this.

683
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,420
There's a lot going on

684
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,620
at the Government Office lately.

685
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,380
I'll need to stay there for a while.

686
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,980
Have someone pack

687
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,060
my things.

688
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,060
But it's cold and damp there.

689
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,740
Do you really have to go?

690
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,100
Let me help you take off your robe first.

691
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,220
How long

692
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,420
will you be gone?

693
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,860
Just for three days,

694
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,340
for now.

695
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,900
I'll have it arranged.

696
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,060
Alright.

697
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,900
I...

698
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,820
Sorry, I drank too much today.

699
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,980
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

700
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,420
Shall I have hot water

701
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,860
prepared for a bath?

702
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,460
No need.

703
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,420
I'll sleep

704
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,380
at the office tonight.

705
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,380
Good night.

706
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,620
My Lord?

707
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,180
It's so late.

708
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,140
May I ask why we've been summoned?

709
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,940
It's already late, you know.

710
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,570
If there's nothing urgent,

711
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,880
you should head back and get some rest.

712
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,460
I wouldn't call you here without a reason.

713
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,500
Yes, My Lord.

714
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,820
My Lord,

715
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,260
what is it? Please say it.

716
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,460
I was thinking…

717
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,780
Yanzhou...

718
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,620
It's at peace now.

719
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,340
No, not Yanzhou.

720
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,850
- Bianzhou...
- Just died.

721
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,500
Oh, right.

722
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,190
I meant Yaozhou...

723
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,220
There is a famed beauty in Yaozhou.

724
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,340
But I suppose that's not what you meant.

725
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,300
Actually, I was saying

726
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,500
that Liangya State...

727
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,020
Are we launching an attack on Liangya?

728
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,860
No, not an attack.

729
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,980
All those regions I just mentioned

730
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,780
will be at the Deer Hunt.

731
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,900
We must begin preparations.

732
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,740
What do you think?

733
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,340
Yes.

734
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,420
Yes, of course.

735
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,460
This is an important matter.

736
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,340
It is.

737
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,300
We must not neglect

738
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,580
the matter of the venue,

739
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,140
nor the proper reception.

740
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,740
So,

741
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,100
we must treat it seriously.

742
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

743
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,900
What...

744
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,900
Sir.

745
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,580
I just remembered

746
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,500
it's been a while

747
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,980
since I last visited Madam.

748
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,380
So,

749
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,740
I shall go with you

750
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,900
and pay her a brief visit.

751
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,700
- Alright, that's it.
- My Lord, she...

752
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,900
Let's go.

753
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,860
Let's go.

754
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,380
His Lordship is really diligent.

755
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,780
He rushed back here so late

756
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,220
just for the Deer Hunt?

757
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,700
It is important,

758
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,900
but not that urgent.

759
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,860
Isn't the Deer Hunt next spring?

760
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,540
Maybe he quarreled with Her Ladyship?

761
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,620
Shall we talk to Mr. Wei?

762
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,860
Mr. Wei's busy.

763
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,020
He has been painting

764
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,660
with tavern maids at Luozhong Tavern lately.

765
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,820
Let's go.

766
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,180
My Lady,

767
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,180
are these clothes enough for three days?

768
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,580
That'll do. Pack them up.

769
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,820
My Lady, I'll take them

770
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,460
to His Lordship now.

771
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,340
Alright.

772
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,620
His Lordship just got back,
now he's moving out again.

773
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,540
Why is His Lordship so hot and cold?

774
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,060
Maybe he just needs time to think.

775
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,700
That might not be such a bad thing.

776
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,940
I really don't understand

777
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,540
what you've been saying lately.

778
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,700
His Lordship is clearly
acting against his heart,

779
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,420
yet you still go along with him.

780
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,340
Even you can tell that.

781
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,460
Why should I rush?

782
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,740
Let him think.

783
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,300
I'll have things to do.

784
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,740
What's gotten into Zhonglin?

785
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,060
He moved to the Government Office?

786
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,980
Poor Lady Qiao,

787
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,980
left all alone once again.

788
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,700
You really

789
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,540
do side with Her Ladyship now.

790
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,740
Now, I see

791
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,300
what's troubling Zhonglin.

792
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,300
He keeps avoiding Lady Qiao

793
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,780
because he's falling for her.

794
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,580
Nothing gets past you, huh?

795
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,580
Sometimes,

796
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,540
you've got to cut yourself some slack.

797
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,340
Look at Lady Zhu.

798
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,900
Her life hasn't been all that hard.

799
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,340
Ma'am, Her Ladyship requests to see you.

800
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,140
Let her in.

801
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,980
Yes, Ma'am.

802
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,260
His Lordship has been busy
with court affairs.

803
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,060
I don't want to be idle either.

804
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,660
Is there anything I can do

805
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,940
for you, Grandmother?

806
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,780
Yes.

807
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,180
Zhonglin is making plans for the Deer Hunt.

808
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,820
I want to

809
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,100
turn the city drill ground

810
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,660
into the Deer Hunt venue.

811
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,100
It needs some renovation.

812
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,940
Can you handle it?

813
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,940
I'm willing to give it a try.

814
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,340
I'll assign you some help.

815
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,780
Thank you, Grandmother.

816
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,220
But I have another idea.

817
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,180
What is it?

818
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,380
The Deer Hunt will invite
powers from all regions

819
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,300
to discuss canal construction together.

820
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,100
For such a grand event,

821
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,060
why not have someone

822
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,060
write some poems and prose

823
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,340
to promote it?

824
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,020
That way, it would spread

825
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,380
His Lordship's visions,

826
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,220
and also,

827
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,620
the powers will share the glory,

828
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,860
making them more likely to attend.

829
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,260
That's a brilliant idea.

830
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,620
Let's do as you propose.

831
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,020
I'll do my best, Grandmother.

832
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,780
Go tell Zhonglin

833
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,100
that I've entrusted Lady Qiao

834
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,060
with the Deer Hunt Venue.

835
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,660
Let's see how can he can avoid her now.

836
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,900
Who said I can't live without her?

837
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,780
I think the Government Office

838
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,100
is far better than home.

839
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,820
At least here, I feel free.
