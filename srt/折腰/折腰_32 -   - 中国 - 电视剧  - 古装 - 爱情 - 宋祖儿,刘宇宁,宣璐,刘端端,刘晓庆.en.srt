00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,820
Do you blame me?

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,260
Why would you say that?

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,410
When you were at home,

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
you were treasured like a jewel.

34
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,380
But in the Wei State,

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,020
you're cautious everywhere.

36
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,260
The Wei State

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,410
is not a cage,

38
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,930
but for you,

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,930
it's no different.

40
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,410
And I've never seen you

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,820
so at ease before.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
It's my fault.

43
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,690
You treat me well.

44
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,540
The days with you

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,260
are comfortable and happy.

46
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,130
Then it's settled.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,060
Kangjun is your home,

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,730
and Yujun

49
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,730
is also your home.

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,900
Let's go.

51
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,820
This used to be my favorite place.

52
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,980
In summer, the trees grow thick and full.

53
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,010
I would dance

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,570
as Cousin played the zither.

55
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,500
Those days

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,380
seem far away now.

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,260
Maybe,

58
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,220
some still linger.

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
You're really lucky today.

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,060
Cousin feels like playing again.

61
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,010
Her zither is of exquisite craftsmanship.

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,730
How about this?

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,500
I'll play a piece for you.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,010
No need today.

65
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,060
I've heard you play before.

66
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,610
Spend some time

67
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,130
with your cousin today.

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,260
I'll go for a stroll.

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
Manman!

70
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,340
Don't get up.

71
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,020
You're with child now.

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,250
How could you come
all the way out here alone?

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,540
Do you still see yourself as a young miss?

74
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,460
Soon, you'll be a mother.

75
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,900
We've been apart for so long.

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,460
Meeting here in Kangjun is a rare chance,

77
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,250
so I came early to wait for you.

78
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,100
Cousin, if ever you miss me,

79
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,490
just come back anytime you want.

80
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,700
When I left,

81
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,660
I didn't bring this zither with me.

82
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
But now,

83
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,050
my fingers itch to play.

84
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,090
It's perfect.

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,250
I would be delighted to hear you play.

86
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,810

Manman and I

118
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,660
feel distant now.

119
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,050
It'll be alright.

120
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,580
Why do you

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,900
look so downcast?

122
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,020
I just feel

123
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Cousin and I are no longer as we once were.

124
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,980
That day in Xindu,

125
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,700
when Yanzhou was under siege,

126
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,460
I went to her for help.

127
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,530
She told me...

128
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,130
You know it's dangerous up ahead.

129
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,100
Are you going to send him to die?

130
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,580
You are capable and responsible.

131
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,700
You can save the people of the realm,

132
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,010
but I'm different.

133
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm just an ordinary woman

134
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,770
with no ambition and no grand vision.

135
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,580
Even if I give it my all,

136
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,850
I can only protect one person.

137
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,700
I'm not like you,

138
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,300
who pushes her husband

139
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,250
fight and die

140
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,300
for the Qiao Clan,

141
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,610
and for the people of Yanzhou!

142
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,850
But I...

143
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,370
I can't do it.

144
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,530
Did I make a mistake?

145
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,340
Even Cousin knew

146
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,460
not to let her husband take such risks.

147
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,370
But I pushed you, pressured you,

148
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,210
even calculated you.

149
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,420
In those days, I was so afraid

150
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,850
you would think the same,

151
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,980
that I cared nothing for your safety.

152
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,820
In that situation,

153
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,460
you had no other choice.

154
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,530
Besides, I know

155
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,130
my Manman

156
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,340
is not like other women.

157
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,780
She loves me,

158
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,250
her family,

159
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,580
and all the people even more.

160
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,650
So you did nothing wrong.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Also,

162
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,420
I'd love to be your spear and shield,

163
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,060
to fight for you,

164
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,300
to guard your path,

165
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,530
to make your every wish

166
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,340
come true.

167
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,850
I have one more wish.

168
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,730
What is it?

169
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,490
"May you be safe and sound."

170
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,370
You just said

171
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,180
all my wishes would come true.

172
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,820
All I wish is for you to be safe and sound.

173
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Don't worry.

174
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,850
I will be.

175
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,730
You startled me.

176
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,370
Over there.

177
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,820
Feel free to have a look.

178
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,690
Thank you.

179
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,450
It's beautiful.

180
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,850
Isn't it?

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,730
Does it good?

182
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,570
It does.

183
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,660
It really does.

184
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,340
See? It looks just like you.

185
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,220
This one?

186
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,060
Like me?

187
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,610
This chubby little thing is you exactly.

188
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,100
What's wrong?

189
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,700
I'll keep my distance.

190
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,580
I'm chubby. I don't want to crowd you.

191
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,100
It's cheerful and bright.

192
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,490
Everyone,

193
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,940
you've fled far

194
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,130
and suffered much.

195
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,100
For now,

196
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,420
please settle here,

197
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,700
stay warm and well-fed.

198
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,610
Prefect, that's so kind of you!

199
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,610
Prefect, that's so kind of you.

200
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,650
I never thought

201
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,180
- he'd gave us shelter.
- Exactly.

202
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,300
Prefect, you're so kind.

203
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,650
He doesn't look down on us Liangya people.

204
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,520
Exactly.

205
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,460
In the days ahead,

206
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,460
we'll do what we can for you, Prefect.

207
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,180
Thank you, Prefect.

208
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,130
No need for formality.

209
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,250
Please rise.

210
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Distribute the food.

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,770
Mother,

212
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,650
this is for you.

213
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,610
You eat that.

214
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,450
Prefect,

215
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,730
our food was already scarce after the war.

216
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,850
Now I fear we won't hold out much longer.

217
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
Pass my order.

218
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,340
Stop all wine brewing.

219
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,940
We should

220
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,100
save the grain first.

221
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,660
Yes.

222
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,500
(Grain)

223
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,490
Lord of Wei.

224
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,220
May I ask why you are here?

225
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,820
And what's this for?

226
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,940
These are military supplies

227
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,180
I brought to Kangjun.

228
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,220
I hope they will be helpful.

229
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,650
Also, grain from Xindu

230
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,770
will arrive in a few days.

231
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,650
Lord of Wei,

232
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,060
you've lifted a great burden from us!

233
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,180
On behalf of the people,

234
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,940
I thank you, Lord of Wei.

235
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,940
Please rise.

236
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
No need for formality.

237
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,610
Although you thank me,

238
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,530
there's something

239
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,530
I want to ask you.

240
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,250
Because of Liangya,

241
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,340
Yanzhou lies in ruins now.

242
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,010
Why do you shelter

243
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,100
these stragglers and refugees?

244
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,130
Moreover,

245
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,300
some of them may have fought

246
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,060
against you in Liancheng.

247
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,490
These common folks

248
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,250
are war-torn innocents.

249
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,770
They are pitiful souls with nowhere to go.

250
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,370
Does it really matter where they come from?

251
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,420
Who among them

252
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,420
ever wished for war?

253
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,530
They had no choice.

254
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,220
Lord of Wei,

255
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,730
you built canals for the realm

256
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,250
and gave up troops.

257
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,940
You never asked who helped

258
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,890
or opposed you,

259
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,460
nor cared about

260
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,420
past kindness or grudges.

261
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,010
You did it for the people, and so do I.

262
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,770
That's true.

263
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,460
If peace ever comes

264
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,890
one day,

265
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,940
I'll guard it with all my heart

266
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,010
and ensure it

267
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,370
lasts for generations.

268
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,130
Even if peace lasts only for a moment,

269
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,580
a sincere heart can make

270
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,770
its echo last for generations.

271
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,460
If every region

272
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,610
followed your example, Lord of Wei,

273
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,580
then true sincerity

274
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,130
could dissolve hatred

275
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,530
and

276
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,220
bring peace to the land.

277
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,490
I'm willing to assist you

278
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,060
in completing the canal construction.

279
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,700
Let's face difficulties together.

280
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,010
Let water flow in all directions.

281
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,370
Let war be quelled.

282
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,420
Let sincerity dispel hatred

283
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,850
and win peace for the realm.

284
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,300
I hope that day will come.

285
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,300
At the end of the day,

286
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,980
since they've come to Yanzhou,

287
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,650
I can't simply

288
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,940
watch them starve.

289
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,420
But, I'm sorry

290
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,820
for causing you trouble.

291
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,010
You shouldn't have burdened

292
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Wei State because of this.

293
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,420
You're welcome.

294
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,300
In chaotic times,

295
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,530
the people are the most innocent.

296
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,130
Father, we share the same intention,

297
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,770
so I wish to help.

298
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,370
What did you call me?

299
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,730
I called you Father.

300
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,460
It's been a while
since I married Her Ladyship,

301
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,770
but the journey's been rough.

302
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,340
Only now do I get to speak with you.

303
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,010
Your heart is with the people,

304
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,340
just like Her Ladyship's.

305
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,220
Father, I hope

306
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,940
you don't mind

307
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,860
my being late.

308
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,490
Lord of Wei,

309
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,250
I don't deserve this.

310
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,180
This gesture

311
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,810
is not from the Lord of Wei

312
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,330
to the Yanzhou Prefect.

313
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,530
It's from a son-in-law

314
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,730
to his father-in-law.

315
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,660
Zhonglin, you show such respect.

316
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,140
I feel

317
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,530
all the more

318
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,220
uneasy and ashamed.

319
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,900
We're family, no need to be so formal.

320
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,860
The night banquet is about to begin.

321
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,700
Let's go together,

322
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,660
Father.

323
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,650
Of course.

324
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,650
Of course.

325
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,260
This way, please.

326
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,570
(Zhonglin bears no grudge.)

327
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,250
(But our Qiao Clan)

328
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,490
(still owes the Wei Clan a great debt.)

329
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,300
Father,

330
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,490
I'd like to offer you a toast

331
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,490
on behalf of Her Ladyship.

332
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,050
Thank you for raising her.

333
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,180
Speaking of raising her...

334
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,540
Right,

335
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,660
Yue and Lady Ding

336
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,770
have treated Manman as their own,

337
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,490
especially Lady Ding.

338
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,700
She deserves

339
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,290
this toast from Zhonglin.

340
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,090
Mother,

341
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,490
I'd like to offer you a toast.

342
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,570
Thank you

343
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,730
for raising Fan.

344
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,980
Lord of...

345
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,300
Zhonglin,

346
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,250
here's to the rebuilding of Yongning Canal.

347
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,020
Everyone,

348
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,490
raise your cups.

349
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,740
To the canal.

350
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,980
Although

351
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,660
Governor is Manman's uncle,

352
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,530
Yanzhou and Wei State

353
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,140
lie between us.

354
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,860
You'd better

355
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,490
call me Lord of Wei.

356
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,770
Lord of Wei...

357
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,570
Zhonglin means to speak

358
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,900
to me as family,

359
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,700
and to you as an official.

360
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,740
It doesn't conflict.

361
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
Um, well,

362
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,260
Bi Zhi.

363
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,780
Governor.

364
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,420
You should call me Father.

365
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,380
Father.

366
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
I've heard

367
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,530
you repeatedly defeated Xue Tai.

368
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,220
You're pretty talented.

369
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,010
We're short on generals in Yanzhou.

370
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,490
Seems you're destined
to join the Qiao family.

371
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,860
Governor, you flatter me.

372
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,090
Call me Father.

373
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,980
Father.

374
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,570
Though I've fought Xue Tai a few times,

375
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,860
I'm just a stableman.

376
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,730
I know little beyond that.

377
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,180
I merely scraped by.

378
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,810
Fan once said

379
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,940
Xue Tai feared

380
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,700
Lord of Wei and Her Ladyship,

381
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,490
so he never attacked me head-on.

382
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,140
To Lord of Wei.

383
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,220
Cheers.

384
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Now that

385
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,460
you and Fan have both returned home,

386
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,140
settle in properly.

387
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,290
I'll send someone to take over Boya.

388
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
Thank you, Father.

389
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,330
Do you truly

390
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,940
accept Fan and me now?

391
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,810
Boya is just a small place.

392
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,660
Bi Zhi can still manage it well.

393
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,900
Besides,

394
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,180
I've grown used to it.

395
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,700
We will return someday.

396
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,090
That's our real home.

397
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,980
Manman asked for your help, but you refused.

398
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,860
No wonder Wei Shao keeps his distance
from me.

399
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,730
Father, don't worry.

400
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,420
Lord of Wei holds no grudge.

401
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,290
He's still willing to be Bi Zhi's in-law.

402
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,460
You're too naive.

403
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,420
He's only being polite

404
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
because Bi Zhi is useful.

405
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,140
I've explained

406
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,420
the pros and cons to Manman.

407
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,050
I didn't want Bi Zhi

408
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,380
risking his life to help them.

409
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,700
Manman understands.

410
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,330
Daughters often grow distant after marriage.

411
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,330
Daughters of others

412
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,330
know to stand with their kin.

413
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,810
Mine ran off with a stable hand.

414
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,290
At the crucial moment,

415
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,250
you turn your back on your family for him!

416
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
Father,

417
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,860
Bi Zhi is no longer

418
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,330
a stableman.

419
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,300
I know.

420
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,140
He's now Commander of Boya Forces.

421
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,090
The so-called forces

422
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,900
are just a ragtag army.

423
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,090
And you think it's a fine title?

424
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,250
Go tell Bi Zhi,

425
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,090
I'll take over Boya.

426
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,460
He will train my cavalry

427
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,770
and raise my steeds.

428
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,220
He should back up Ci,

429
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,700
so no one dares trample on me.

430
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,490
I refuse.

431
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,180
What did you say?

432
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,010
Father, since you still

433
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,460
see Bi Zhi as a stableman,

434
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,420
I suppose

435
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,180
you'll never accept him as your son-in-law.

436
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,700
I'll live in seclusion with Bi Zhi at Boya.

437
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,530
Let's not interfere with each other.

438
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:46,900
Wouldn't that be better?

439
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
You...

440
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,140
Do you even hear yourself?

441
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,010
To you, I'm just a daughter

442
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,570
who ran off with a stableman.

443
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,250
When Bi Zhi and I were in real danger,

444
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,570
you didn't send a single soldier to help us.

445
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,220
But now that Bi Zhi's gaining power,

446
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,460
you want to use me to control him?

447
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,050
I won't let that happen.

448
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,220
Also,

449
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,050
Bi Zhi didn't come

450
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,620
to fight against Liu Yan.

451
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,010
That decision was mine alone.

452
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,900
The Qiaos never lent him aid.

453
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,420
I could not let him
risk his life for my family.

454
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,900
Manman never blamed me for this.

455
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,330
Governor, you have even less right to!

456
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,380
I am

457
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,530
unfilial to Mother,

458
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,810
and I may have wronged my cousins.

459
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
But, Father,

460
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,010
I owe you nothing.

461
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,090
- You...
- Governor!

462
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,490
If you wish to claim Boya as your own,

463
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,660
send your troops and take it by force.

464
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,610
My Lord.

465
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,660
Mr. Zhang,

466
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,620
look at me now.

467
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,090
Do I look like a patriarch to you?

468
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,180
Both ladies are now backed
by powerful husbands.

469
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,570
They're no longer easy to control.

470
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,380
But I believe

471
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,420
both of them still hold loyalty

472
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,940
toward Yanzhou.

473
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,180
Loyalty to Yanzhou,

474
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,700
but not to me!

475
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,170
Tell me,

476
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,460
what caused all of this?

477
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,770
My Lord,

478
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,010
refugees have been flooding

479
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,700
into Kangjun lately.

480
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Prefect's reputation

481
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,860
may now outshine your own.

482
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,330
What's wrong?

483
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,610
Fan,

484
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,290
you'd defy

485
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,730
your father for me.

486
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,570
That saddens me,

487
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,900
but also makes me happy.

488
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,940
You fool,

489
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,460
I'm not defying him.

490
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,050
Father has always

491
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,530
bullied the weak and feared the strong.

492
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,770
I won't blindly follow him

493
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,220
just because he raised me.

494
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,410
Remember this.

495
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,090
In this realm,

496
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,810
no one can

497
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,770
use me to control you.

498
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,330
Fan,

499
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,570
I'm not scared.

500
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,330
Everything I've done

501
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,900
was for your happiness.

502
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,180
Being with you makes me happiest.

503
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,180
I only hate myself

504
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,570
for not giving you the honor

505
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,050
that the Lord of Wei can.

506
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,330
If I cared about that,

507
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,530
I wouldn't have left with you.

508
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,290
What I care about

509
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,810
is your honest heart.

510
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,380
Sour plums.

511
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,570
That's exactly what I wanted.

512
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,900
It's cold outside.

513
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,900
Let's go into the room.

514
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,940
I love this room.

515
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,770
It's filled with your scent.

516
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,180
It just smells like your wine now.

517
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,980
Does it?

518
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,980
Can you still smell it?

519
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,220
You cheeky rogue.

520
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,860
We're returning to Wei State tomorrow.

521
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,090
Is there anything else

522
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,980
you'd still like to do?

523
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
Tell me.

524
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,490
I'll go with you

525
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,940
at first light.

526
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,460
I have nothing else.

527
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,770
I never imagined a day like this

528
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,010
before I married you.

529
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,140
You weren't just pretending to be happy

530
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,660
for my sake, were you?

531
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,420
If I said I was,

532
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,050
you wouldn't believe me.

533
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,250
Then

534
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,290
if you want to make it up to me,

535
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,420
how about

536
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,420
we strike a deal?

537
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,700
Whatever you want, say it now.

538
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,530
If it's something I can do,

539
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,810
I'll give it my all.

540
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,610
How about

541
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,730
giving me a child?

542
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,570
You want a child from me?

543
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,460
What do you mean, from you?

544
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,660
It would be our child.

545
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,570
And

546
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,730
I want it now.

547
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,570
I promise I'll give you a new home,

548
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,980
one filled with children and joy.

549
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,900
(Kangjun)

550
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,180
There's not much time.

551
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,050
You still need to hurry back to Yujun.

552
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,380
I won't insist on keeping you.

553
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,770
I only hope that next time,

554
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,810
you'll stay a little longer.

555
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,290
Governor, you're so kind.

556
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,780
Father,

557
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,250
we'll take our leave.

558
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,770
Please take care of

559
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,180
your health.

560
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,420
May I have

561
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,700
a word with you?

562
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,370
Of course.

563
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,220
Is this the direction to Wei State?

564
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,850
That's right.

565
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,780
- Father...
- Father.

566
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,460
On behalf of the Qiao Clan,

567
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,530
I bow from afar

568
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,170
to the spirits of

569
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,460
the late Lord of Wei,

570
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,490
your late father and brother.

571
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,820
I don't dare to seek forgiveness,

572
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,490
only to express my deepest gratitude.

573
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,340
I'm grateful to Lady Xu

574
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,570
and Lord of Wei

575
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,370
for your magnanimity.

576
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,130
Back then,

577
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,340
at the battle of Xindu,

578
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,570
it was the Qiao Clan's fault.

579
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,260
We brought disaster upon your kin.

580
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,170
I feel deep remorse.

581
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,570
My guilt is beyond words.

582
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,130
The grudge between our families

583
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,380
was settled long ago

584
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,940
by my grandmother.

585
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,420
You bear no resentment,

586
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,050
but I cannot pretend to forget.

587
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,980
All I ever wanted

588
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,940
was for Manman

589
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,380
to marry

590
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,610
someone she loved,

591
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,170
a man who would cherish her,

592
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,780
and live a peaceful life with her.

593
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,260
But fate had other plans.

594
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,780
On my late father's deathbed,

595
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,980
he took advantage of the situation

596
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,940
and arranged this marriage with you.

597
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,130
If the Qiaos and the Weis

598
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,010
had traded places,

599
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,380
I must admit

600
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,460
I wouldn't have treated

601
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,610
an enemy's daughter kindly.

602
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,650
But Lady Xu

603
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,900
has been gracious and generous.

604
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,490
She has cared deeply for my daughter.

605
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,650
You didn't turn her away.

606
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,210
You've shown her great care.

607
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,090
Even for her single request,

608
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,610
you dropped everything

609
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,380
to personally escort her home

610
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,570
and stepped into Yanzhou.

611
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,210
That made me all the more ashamed.

612
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,260
Now I see,

613
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,420
all my doubts

614
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,900
came from judging you

615
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,260
by my own narrow heart.

616
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,260
Father,

617
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,820
I'm ashamed as well.

618
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,530
I, too,

619
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,460
once made things difficult

620
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,490
and treated Her Ladyship harshly.

621
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,210
When did you ever treat me harshly?

622
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,650
I'm just a man of little worth.

623
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,260
Life and death, honor and shame,

624
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,820
they're fleeting to me.

625
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,380
All I care about

626
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,610
is my daughter.

627
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,460
Today,

628
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,610
I'd like to take this chance

629
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,010
to entrust Manman you, Lord of Wei.

630
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,380
Please protect her

631
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,420
and let her live a life of joy.

632
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,340
Here and now,

633
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,460
I offer you my sincere gratitude.

634
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,740
Father,

635
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,740
you have my word.

636
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,090
From now on,

637
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,570
I will cherish Manman even more.

638
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,300
Please,

639
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,420
trust me.

640
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,220
I trust you.

641
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,970
I really do.

(Yujun, Wei State)

643
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,380
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

644
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
My Lady,

645
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,980
these are the ceremonial items prepared for

646
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,300
tomorrow's memorial rite.

647
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Please take a look.

648
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,860
(Gift List of the Memorial Rite)

649
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,130
His Lordship won a great battle

650
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,300
and honors his father and brother.

651
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,340
You've worked so hard for this,

652
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,980
but will you be allowed to attend

653
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,210
and step into the ancestral hall?

654
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,420
Forget it.

655
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,340
Back when we first arrived in Yujun,

656
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,170
we were left outside of the city gates

657
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,650
just to avoid taking part in this very rite.

658
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,570
According to tradition,

659
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,690
a new wife who hasn't paid her respects
at her husband's ancestral hall

660
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,130
is not accepted nor recognized by the family.

661
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,130
Whether they accept me or not

662
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,420
depends on His Lordship's attitude.

663
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,300
Besides,

664
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,980
to ask Grandmother, Mother, and His Lordship

665
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,530
to let me into the ancestral hall

666
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,690
is asking too much, isn't it?

667
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,420
Why do I bring trouble upon myself?

668
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,660
My Lady,

669
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,820
this was rushed by His Lordship's orders.

670
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,490
He reminded them again and again,

671
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,610
worried it might delay
tomorrow's memorial rite.

672
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,190
My Lady,

673
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,780
this is the ceremonial robe.
