The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why didn't you bring the hairpin I gave you?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nan Jun said it was made casually.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sure you don't like it.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I didn't bring it.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How could I make it casually?

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I cleaned it for you.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, Nan Jun.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are really a goddess.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Gao Hao's words are really good.

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's good?

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just a few words.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What? Nan Jun can do it?

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I studied in college at five.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I studied painting at seven.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And when I was a kid,

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was with my cousin.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I was a doctor of the university for twenty years.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I was a dream worker.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Northern Dream is a good painting.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Southern Zhang is a public book.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How can the dream be written by a person of high rank?

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I believe you must have heard of the Northern Dream.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So Nan Jun is really hidden.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then the painting should be written by Nan Jun himself.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Write it by yourself?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't have to write it.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Maybe it's better than him.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I just see you want to create a world for the Luli Conference.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have a lot of work.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I'm arranging someone to invite Gao Heng here.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
By the way, I invited Gao Heng here for you.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Nan Jun is good at everything.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And he is generous and generous.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He can be a good son-in-law.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
People will definitely praise him.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Gao Heng can write such a gorgeous poem because he is a great poet.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If the poem is moving now,

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
the words he wrote are probably also a good poem.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Isn't there a song in the?

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The shadow is like a grass, the branches are like a seed.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The man is like a man, the stone is like a heart.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are so sweet.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Master, on the first day of the new year,

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we need to find a place to bury the new wine.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Where to buy wine this year is suitable.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Master, where to buy wine?

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's good that you decide on this.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Then I'll take the moon away.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Master, is there anything new today?

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Nothing new.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe it's almost the end of the year.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm in a good mood to celebrate the new year.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Report.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master, Mr. Zhenshi wants to see you.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mr. Zhenshi wants to see you.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You wrote it?

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know if the female king is familiar with music.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Can you play the song I wrote?

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't want to.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The female king doesn't like to be exposed.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So don't write it for him in the future.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I didn't expect the female king to be so good at music.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I admire you.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I thought you were only good at poetry.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I didn't expect the music to be so good.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not talented.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
After I took the position, I studied for three days.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Then I made this song.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You just learned it?

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You still have this skill?

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then you have to hide it quickly.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Don't let others find out.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, you are not talented.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can't be found out by others.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When the divine invitation comes,

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and you leave the army,

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it will be a loss to the country.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I appreciate it.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just want to stay here for a while.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you have any documents to entrust me,

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
please don't hesitate.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, no, no.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't trap you for selfish reasons.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Your talent should be scattered in the world.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It should be...

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I suddenly remember

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,700
you often had this moment of

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
crushing.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How about I send you to be the Yunzhong Jun?

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To show my gratitude.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, no, no.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't dare to trouble you.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You don't have to be polite.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Send you to Yunzhong Jun.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well...

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't...

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you have any requests, just tell me.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I will make you feel like a soldier in Yunzhong Jun.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, you don't have to be so anxious.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, no, no.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am trying to be a good man.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You should be more lazy.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This can help you to write the story of the Yongning Qu.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And the female army has always been looking forward to the past.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They have never been able to go to the south.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You should be the official.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Be careful of the steps.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you for your trust.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I will remember the Yongning Qu department.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I will also remember you.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Senior.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you doing?

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't worry.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I will send you out safely.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Senior.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Thank you.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are welcome.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Take care.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mr. Zhen Shi has been asked by the chief to go to Yunzhong Jun.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He is observing the moment.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yunzhong Jun?

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That is a place where no grass is growing.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yunzhong Jun is a border of Wei State.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The road is slow.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No one can come back.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I passed by there when I was traveling.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They are fixing the road.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not just a place to come back.

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Really?

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's even better.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It will help you to relieve your worries.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sister.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Did you take the medicine?

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We can't stay here for too long.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If we stay here,

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Chen Pang will find out.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The medicine that Shiyi prescribed is not good enough.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's find another one.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The medicine is for Xia Meng.

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We came out of the desert.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We didn't have enough money.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We are in a hurry.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We came out of the desert.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm afraid we have no money.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Who is it?

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
General Xue risked his life for his late husband.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
His late husband's life

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
is really hard.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He even played a farmer.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You have a favor to me.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will find you a woman.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If so,

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
please forgive me.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will go back to pack some clothes and soft materials.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will go back to Dan Jun with you.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I will be trapped forever.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have no wrong in my wish.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I can't cure you

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
from the wound on the jade tower.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will protect you

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
by the order of the female army.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I will be the emperor

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
this time.

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I will be with you

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and the female army.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The female army

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
is on the wrong side.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I will follow you forever.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The one who wanted to

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
cure me from the wound

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
was never my husband.

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It seems

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't marry the wrong person.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't be sad.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Now the Wei State

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
is going to hold the Luli Conference.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The purpose is still unclear.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now the military forces in various states are moving in a dark flow.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please follow me

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to return to the Jue County.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You mean

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the Wei State is going to hold the Luli Conference?

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The Marquis Wei is inviting a group of people.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
At that time, the military forces in various states

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
will gather in the county.

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The military forces will gather in the county.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Can you get the gold and iron today?

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now the county

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
has become a place of no one's care.

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How can he invite me?

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Qiao Wei Alliance

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
is much more stable than I expected.

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Qiao Yue is looking for beauties everywhere.

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He said he would give them to the states.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In order to find the female army,

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I went to Kang County alone a few days ago.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There was a loss of the army.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The female army should follow me

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to return to the Jue County.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't go back to the Jue County with you.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The Wei State is going to hold the Luli Conference

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to invite a group of people.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I want to go to the female army

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
to find a way out.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The female army means

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to re-marry?

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I have no feelings for my husband.

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I should be loyal to him.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
instead of living in a secluded place,

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I want to

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
make a step forward

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
for my husband's wish.

226
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If Bianzhou is in Chen Pang's hands,

227
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
my husband will die in a dead end.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I have to go to the Jue County

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to find a way out

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and take Bianzhou back.

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I promised my master

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to follow the female army until my death.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm willing to fight for the female army

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and protect the female army.

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This is the 50,000 soldiers of the Jue County.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is the military uniform.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The military uniform.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The female army is here.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The ceremony begins.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The ceremony begins.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The ceremony begins.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The ceremony begins.

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Peace of Our могу

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Peace of our egor

246
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,000
Peace talks

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Peace talks

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you, ancestors of the world.

249
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:11,680
Protecting the country and

250
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
growing grains and crops.

251
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
We will start the discussion today.

252
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Your Majesty,

253
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
this is the wine that the people

254
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
made with the rice this year.

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Please taste the wine

256
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
and calm your worries.

257
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Your Majesty, please taste the wine

258
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
and enjoy with the people.

259
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
Your Majesty.

260
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Thank you, your Majesty.

261
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Your Majesty.

262
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Can you dance with us today?

263
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I...

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Your Majesty.

265
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Your Majesty.

266
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Your Majesty.

267
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Come on.

268
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
This is...

269
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Xiaotao, can we...

270
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
No.

271
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Is it difficult?

272
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
No.

273
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,680
I haven't said I will do it.

274
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,680
Nothing is difficult.

275
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Here.

276
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Thank you, your Majesty.

277
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Enjoy with the people.

278
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Thank you, everyone.

279
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Today is the day of the lunar new year.

280
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Let's go home and get together with your family.

281
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Thank you, your Majesty.

282
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
You can go back to your room.

283
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
I'll carry you.

284
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Come on.

285
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
How dare you use the military as a flag?

286
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
You are the only one who can decide in this life.

287
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Come on.

288
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
You have been preparing for the ceremony for these days.

289
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
It must be hard for you.

290
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
You should go home early today.

291
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I'll wait for you.

292
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Okay.

293
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I'll go.

294
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
I haven't seen the snow with Nan Jun.

295
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
It's snowing.

296
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Cousin.

297
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Sister, I didn't expect you to prepare a ceremony for me.

298
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
I like it.

299
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Ceremony family has one.

300
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Cousin, of course, has one.

301
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I also prepared a ceremony for you.

302
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
Open it.

303
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
It's a virtual dream.

304
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Thank you, cousin.

305
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I heard that the Taisho Temple this year is very lively.

306
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Cousin didn't go?

307
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
I thought you knew.

308
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Kang Jun doesn't often snow, right?

309
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
It's colder here than Kang Jun.

310
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Kang Jun has more rainwater.

311
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Do you know?

312
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
When I was a kid, Zhong Lin and I liked snow the most.

313
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Because we don't have to get up early to practice martial arts.

314
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,680
We can also play with rabbits.

315
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,680
At that time, Zhong Lin was timid.

316
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,680
He didn't dare to kill the rabbits when he caught them.

317
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
He always secretly let them go.

318
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Nan Jun is a good boy.

319
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,680
If you want to go out, you have to go from here.

320
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Then I'll say goodbye here.

321
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Okay.

322
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Thank you for your ceremony.

323
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
It's good that you like it.

324
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
This gift is very thoughtful.

325
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
It's just that the woman likes it.

326
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Other things are not bad.

327
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
They are all valuable things.

328
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,680
This shows that the Great Madam and the Madam all like our woman.

329
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
This matter is more and more valuable.

330
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
If it were Madam Ding,

331
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,680
she would definitely try to find the woman she likes the most.

332
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Instead of spending money.

333
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Grandmother and grandmother are willing to spend money on me.

334
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
They are already my descendants.

335
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I can't compare to my grandmother.

336
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I grew up under her.

337
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
I can't hide what I like from her.

338
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,680
But if I want my grandmother and grandmother to treat me as their biological child,

339
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I have to get along with them more.

340
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,680
I don't know how my grandmother and grandmother are doing.

341
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
How can I get along with them?

342
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,680
Nanjing.

343
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
When I was passing by,

344
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
I saw people lighting up the lanterns.

345
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,680
So I thought you liked these things too.

346
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Yes. I like these valuable things.

347
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Let's go to the front.

348
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
Let's go.

349
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Sir, please put the lanterns down.

350
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
There is also a pen and ink.

351
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Please write your wishes on the lanterns.

352
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
The lanterns will flow down.

353
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
The lotus god will naturally receive your wishes.

354
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
This is very brilliant.

355
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,680
If you can make your wish with a lantern,

356
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,680
wouldn't that be a long-standing secret?

357
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Don't be too stupid, okay?

358
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
I want two.

359
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Okay.

360
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Take it.

361
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
No need. You can play this yourself. I don't need it.

362
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I don't believe in these.

363
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
If you want to achieve something, you must be smart.

364
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Sir, this is too much.

365
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
It's okay. Keep it.

366
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Sir, this is for you.

367
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Okay. Thank you, sir.

368
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Sir, take care.

369
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
This is for you.

370
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm sorry.

372
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm sorry.

373
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
I'm sorry.

374
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I'm sorry.

375
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm sorry.

378
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm sorry.

379
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm sorry.

380
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm sorry.

382
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm sorry.

384
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
How come you don't like it?

385
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Are you okay with the tea?

386
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I'm fine.

387
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Did you drink it?

388
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
I'm fine.

389
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Okay.

390
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
I'll drink it now.

391
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Okay.

392
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
I'm fine.

393
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
I'll drink it now.

394
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm fine.

395
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
I'm fine.

396
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm really fine.

397
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,680
I'm fine.

398
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
I'm fine.

399
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
You don't want to face me?

400
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,080
Fine. I'll write yours.

401
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,640
Hurry up.

402
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,480
Call me if you want to sing it.

403
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,320
No.

404
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,840
Call me if you want to call me.

405
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,880
Hurry up.

406
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:24,000
I only miss you.

407
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
It's getting late.

408
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
Let's go back.

409
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,200
Okay.

410
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,160
You go back first.

411
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,720
I have something to do in Yashu.

412
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,360
It's so late.

413
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,280
You still have something to do?

414
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:40,920
Yes.

415
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,080
I just remembered it.

416
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,760
How about this?

417
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,880
I'll ask Xiaotan to send you back.

418
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Xiaotan.

419
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,280
Send the female army back.

420
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes.

421
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm leaving.

422
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,200
Okay.

423
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,240
Aren't you leaving?

424
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,400
You go first.

425
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,120
I'll go right away.

426
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,380
Young Master.

427
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,740
You have to get back quickly afterwards.

428
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:28,980
Go.

429
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,580
Master.

430
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,620
We can still beat them with our edge at six.

431
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,380
For such a cold day,

432
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,580
you made us mess around.

433
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,140
Go and cush them.

434
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,900
Take this back.

435
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,100
There, there.

436
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,940
Master.

437
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,440
It's his wish.

438
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,520
You just take it.

439
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,280
What?

440
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,400
Which side are you on?

441
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
You don't need to come back now.

442
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
He's been like this

443
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
since he gave the gold to Tao Zi.

444
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,320
He's not like that.

445
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,560
Find it.

446
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,720
Give me that.

447
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,640
Master.

448
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm the master of Weiguo.

449
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,520
I need to know

450
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,920
what the people are thinking

451
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
and what they want.

452
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,680
Of course,

453
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,120
I need to know what the women are thinking.

454
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Why are you looking at me?

455
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,520
Find your own reason.

456
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,320
That looks like it.

457
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,960
Give it to that old man.

458
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,680
Master.

459
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,760
This one.

460
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,240
May the state of Yan State be prosperous and peaceful.

461
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,880
May the father and mother be well.

462
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,640
May the father be healthy.

463
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,480
May the son be well-educated.

464
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,160
May the elder sister and brother-in-law be well-off.

465
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,920
May the elder sister and brother-in-law be well-off.

466
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,760
One less.

467
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Not less.

468
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,560
One less.

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,720
Who are you looking for?

470
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,840
The Japanese.

471
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,720
There are only a few women in the North.

472
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,840
Reply.

473
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,160
Master.

474
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,720
You don't want to see the wishes of the other people?

475
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
I didn't write master.

476
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,000
Thank you.

477
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
Has Lan Jun come back?

478
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,520
I happened to have a question for him.

479
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,880
For the couple's wedding tomorrow,

480
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
please come and greet the grandparents.

481
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,200
How do I greet them in the festive manner?

482
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,320
It's my first time in the Weis' home.

483
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,800
What?

484
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,440
Why are you so fat?

485
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
I'll call the doctor.

486
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,880
No need.

487
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,600
You just fell asleep at night.

488
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,400
It's been many times.

489
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,120
But you never care.

490
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,520
Then Nanjun should have said earlier.

491
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,440
How about this?

492
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
You sleep in the bed today. I'll sleep in the bed.

493
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,760
No need.

494
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
Instead of studying the bed and sleeping in the bed,

495
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,960
think about

496
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,560
how to make you get better.

497
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,280
Then Nanjun shouldn't go to Yashu tomorrow.

498
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,760
Stay at home.

499
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll try to help you.

500
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,720
Ahjie.

501
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,960
Here's the medicine.

502
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
This bowl is a strong medicine.

503
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,160
It's effective and can hurt your body.

504
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,000
This bowl is a medicine for health.

505
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,160
It's slow but warm.

506
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,040
Which bowl do you want to drink?

507
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,800
Ahjie.

508
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,320
I have to go back to Yuchu.

509
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,800
Goodbye, Wei Hao.

510
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
Mingxu.

511
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,720
Mingxu,

512
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,800
I've been waiting for you.

513
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,120
Get me something.

514
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,400
I'm thirsty.

515
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,600
Get me a cup of water.

516
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,640
Tao Ruo, I'm going to tell you

517
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,560
to be with General Wei Liang a little while,

518
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,520
don't be overly active.

519
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
But why?

520
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,200
The more decisive we are, the more we will suffer.

521
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Nan Jun.

522
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,720
I can't just tell you without telling the truth?

523
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,680
I never needed the bullshit제가 the .

524
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,880
What Mr. Nan said is,

525
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,760
don't get angry with us.

526
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
What should we say?

527
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,400
Just let us do our job.

528
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,520
It's urgent.

529
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,600
Why is Lan Jun up?

530
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,120
I have something to do.

531
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,600
You're not recovered yet?

532
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
I'm relieved by you.

533
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sleepy.

534
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Don't be sleepy.

535
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,680
What are you doing here?

536
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,560
Xiao Tao.

537
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,440
What are you doing here?

538
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
Are you looking for me?

539
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,880
I'm looking for you.

540
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,640
Looking for me?

541
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,120
No.

542
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,520
Just tell me.

543
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I'll go there.

544
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,960
And you can go there yourself.

545
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
That's a trouble.

546
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,040
Yes.

547
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,760
Right.

548
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,800
Let me ask you.

549
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,000
What's wrong with Lan Jun today?

550
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Lan Jun?

551
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,640
Is he in the infirmary?

552
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Impossible.

553
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,160
The female doctor said that

554
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
Lan Jun was not in good shape

555
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
since he came back last night.

556
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,040
No.

557
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,520
You always say Lan Jun.

558
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,520
Nothing else.

559
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,200
I'm here.

560
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,360
No.

561
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,440
Yes.

562
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,240
Come here.

563
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,040
What's wrong?

564
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
You gave me a small gold watch last time.

565
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,680
I'll prepare a gift for you.

566
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,400
How about it?

567
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,000
Really?

568
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,040
Let me see it.

569
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,760
Look at you.

570
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,200
Let me see.

571
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,680
I'm not ready.

572
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,920
Okay.

573
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
Tell me what's wrong with Lan Jun.

574
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,360
Let me think.

575
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,240
I remember.

576
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,360
Don't tell your sister-in-law.

577
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,040
Don't worry.

578
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,200
I won't tell her.

579
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,280
Last night,

580
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
Master took us four

581
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,560
to look for water in the faraway road.

582
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,520
Finally, we found the water in the female doctor's pond.

583
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
We were in a bad mood.

584
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,960
It must be because of this.

585
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,760
I don't think so.

586
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,480
You can't tell the female doctor.

587
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,000
Don't worry.

588
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,600
I won't tell her.

589
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm leaving.

590
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,360
Be careful.

591
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,120
Be careful, Tao.

592
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,000
We should let the female doctor know it.

593
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,600
Right.

594
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,160
It's okay.

595
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,360
Tao won't listen to me.

596
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,520
I know her.

597
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,400
Give me the gift later.

598
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,040
Take it.

599
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,200
So that's why.

600
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,240
Why are you not angry?

601
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,600
Lan Jun.

602
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,280
You don't want to

603
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,480
write a male name?

604
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,240
I think it's a male name.

605
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,960
You're not trying to show your apology.

606
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,960
You're preparing for the male name.

607
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,400
It's not his fault.

608
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
I didn't do it right.

609
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,880
You should apologize to him.

610
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:52,680
Because this isn't the end of the game.

611
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,040
This is the situation.

612
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,680
No way, no way.

613
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,620
You're on the wrong side of that rock..

614
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,460
This one is a ton of tarp.

615
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,720
Myeeee!

616
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,560
Nan Jun, you're finally back.

617
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,360
Nv Jun...

618
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,560
What's wrong with him?

619
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,280
Nv Jun waited for you to come back.

620
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
He's drunk.

621
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Who said I was drunk?

622
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Nan Jun!

623
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
You're back!

624
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,280
How could you

625
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
let him get so drunk?

626
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,000
What's the matter with you?

627
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,000
Nan Jun was right.

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
He must have been drunk.

629
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,480
He'll never be like this again.

630
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,160
No...

631
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,760
Where are you going?

632
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
Come back!

633
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,440
Come back!

634
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,320
Come back!

635
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,880
Come back!

636
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,760
Stop running!

637
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,160
Come back!

638
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,560
This is not good.

639
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
No.

640
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,200
Don't move.

641
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,120
Sit down.

642
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,880
Lie down.

643
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,760
Can you stop thinking about it?

644
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
Water.

645
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,000
Do you want water?

646
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,680
Wait.

647
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,600
Come on, drink water.

648
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
Come on, wake up.

649
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,520
Wake up, come on.

650
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,720
Drink.

651
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,880
Do you want more?

652
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,360
You're drunk.

653
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,640
Don't drink so much.

654
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,840
Nan Jun is a man.

655
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,000
How can he be so petty?

656
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,840
I know Nan Jun is angry.

657
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,360
I'm not in love with you.

658
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,000
It's because Nan Jun wrote his wish.

659
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,080
I wrote my regret.

660
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,640
Nan Jun is stubborn.

661
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,200
He can do anything.

662
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,920
But I can only bite my family.

663
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,680
Only if I'm stubborn

664
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,920
can my family live without Nan Jun.

665
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:58,000
Ha içinde

666
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,320
網膠

667
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,760
Daily Life

668
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,760
All my things

669
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,180
I don't want to use them

670
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,680
You're mine

671
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,120
So what can you do back now?

672
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,280
So what can you do back now?

673
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:28,680
How can I light up the dream and admit it?

674
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Through my fingers, I quietly touch my heart.

675
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,680
As if the ancients had a obsession.

676
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:52,680
I have nothing to ask for, but I have no wish.

677
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:01,680
I once looked at the world, but I couldn't understand it.

678
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,680
The wind and fire are finally disbanded, like the gentleness of a pheasant.

679
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:17,680
The sky is clear, how can I forget it?

680
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I wish to paint the wind and the moon, and wait for the white-winged swan to appear.

681
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,680
The night is like a dream, but I can't fall into your eyes.

682
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,680
I want to see you.

683
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,680
I want to see you.

684
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,680
I want to see you.

685
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I want to see you.

686
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,680
I want to see you.

687
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,680
I want to see you.

688
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,680
I want to see you.

689
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I wish to cross the sea of mountains and meet your wishes.

690
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,680
I want to wait for the white-winged swan to appear.

691
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,680
The night is like a dream, but I can't fall into your eyes.

692
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,680
I want to see you.

693
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
I want to see you.

694
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,680
I want to see you.

695
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Even if the wind and snow are behind me.

696
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,680
I don't want to be a fool, just for this missing.

697
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,680
I don't want to forget.
