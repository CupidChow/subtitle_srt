30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,270
Why aren't you wearing
the hairpin I gave you?

31
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,460
You said you made it casually.

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,900
I figured you didn't like it,

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
so I didn't wear it.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,180
How could I have had it made casually?

35
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,740
I put a lot of thought into that gift.

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,620
Thank you, My Lord.

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,410
You truly carry yourself like an immortal

38
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,010
drifting on clouds.

39
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,850
Master Gao Heng's verses are impressive.

40
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,780
I don't think so.

41
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,690
They're just flowery nonsense.

42
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,380
Oh? You write as well?

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,100
I began my studies at five,

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,220
painting at seven.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,290
When I was a child,

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,940
Yan and I studied under Scholar Meng,

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,850
Senior Scholar of the State Academy

48
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,890
of twenty years.

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,220
Meng of the North is famed for painting;

50
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,540
Zhang of the South, for calligraphy.

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,780
How could someone like Gao Heng
compare to Meng or Zhang?

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,980
I'm sure you've heard

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,780
of Meng of the North.

54
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,540
So, you've truly been hiding your talents.

55
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,780
You should've written

56
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,820
the poetic exposition.

57
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
I might not do worse.

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,260
Maybe even better than he did.

59
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,170
I saw you wished to

60
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,540
promote the Deer Hunt.

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,980
But I've been busy with work.

62
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,060
So

63
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,220
I asked someone to invite Gao Heng.

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,070
Speaking of which,

65
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,130
I was the one who invited him for you.

66
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,730
Yes, that's true.

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,850
You handle everything well.

68
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,660
You're so broad-minded

69
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,290
and gracious to men of talent.

70
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,170
Surely, the people will sing your praises.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,730
Gao Heng's ornate verses

72
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,690
exist only

73
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,980
because Wei State thrives.

74
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,610
If the times were turbulent,

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,850
his words would be

76
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,380
bleak and sorrowful.

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,730
Isn't there a ballad in Bianzhou?

78
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,940
"Soft grows the sorrow grass,

79
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,540
thoughts drift far and slow.

80
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,700
When the gentleman departs,

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,290
worries weigh on the heart."

82
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,610
You're so sweet with your words.

83
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,450
My Lord,

84
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,660
on New Year's Eve,

85
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,290
we should bury the casks of the new brew.

86
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,810
Where shall we bury them this year?

87
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,650
My Lord?

88
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,170
Where shall we bury the casks
of the new brew?

89
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,290
Well,

90
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,700
you decide, sir.

91
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,980
Just this once,

92
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,460
I'll overstep a little.

93
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,570
My lord,

94
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,220
is something troubling you today?

95
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,980
No, not really.

96
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,660
Perhaps it's just

97
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,810
the year's end is near.

98
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,220
The festival is coming,

99
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,900
and I feel unusually joyful.

100
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,620
Reporting,

101
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,340
My Lord.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,410
Master Zhenshi wants to see you.

103
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Did you write this?

104
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,700
I wonder

105
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,700
does Her Ladyship know music?

106
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,370
Could she play and sing

107
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,850
the piece I composed?

108
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,810
Then better not let her try.

109
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,900
Her Ladyship...

110
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,410
Her Ladyship dislikes attention.

111
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,730
So please,

112
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,140
don't compose for her again.

113
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,050
I didn't expect Her Ladyship to possess

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,460
such noble virtue and gracious humility.

115
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,810
I'm in awe.

116
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,170
I thought you excelled only in poetry.

117
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,050
I didn't realize

118
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,660
your music is equally fine.

119
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,370
I'm not so talented.

120
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,810
Once I received the task,

121
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,100
I studied for three days

122
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,700
to compose this piece.

123
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,660
You only just learned it?

124
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,100
You have such talent?

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,170
Better keep it hidden

126
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,730
and don't let her find out.

127
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,250
I mean

128
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,410
you're truly learned and gifted.

129
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,900
We mustn't let word get out,

130
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,540
or they'll invite you

131
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,140
away from Yujun.

132
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,140
That would be a great loss for Wei.

133
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Lord of Wei,

134
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,300
you flatter me.

135
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,490
I was merely traveling through,

136
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,220
hoping to rest here for a while.

137
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,980
If there's any writing you need done,

138
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,900
I'd be happy to help.

139
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,460
No, no. That won't do.

140
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,730
I can't keep you here

141
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,780
for my own selfish reasons.

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,490
Your gifts

143
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,980
deserve to travel far and wide.

144
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,540
You should...

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,870
Ah, that reminds me.

146
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,250
You've often spoken highly of
the Moya Inscriptions.

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Why not allow me

148
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,700
to arrange for an escort to Yunzhong,
so you may

149
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,730
see them for yourself?

150
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,700
No, no.

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
I wouldn't dare trouble you, Lord of Wei.

152
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,770
You're most welcome.

153
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,420
You two,

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,980
escort Master Zhenshi

155
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,250
to Yunzhong.

156
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,690
What...

157
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,490
- I...
- Whatever you need,

158
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,330
just say the word.

159
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,850
We'll make sure you feel

160
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,170
right at home in Yunzhong.

161
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,100
Is it necessary to rush off
to see the inscriptions?

162
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,940
Of course.

163
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,810
For a writer, inspiration is everything.

164
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,780
You should travel as much as you can.

165
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,980
Only then can you capture

166
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,700
the grandeur of the Yongning Canal.

167
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,740
Besides,

168
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,340
Her Ladyship had long wished to go

169
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,370
but never had the chance.

170
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,250
Now, you may go in her stead.

171
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,250
Watch your step.

172
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,620
Thank you for the trust.

173
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,680
I'll keep The Ode to Yongning Canal
close to heart.

174
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,490
And I will remember you as well.

175
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,080
- Mr. Wei.
- Mr. Wei.

176
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,930
What is this about?

177
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,340
Please rest assured.

178
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,690
I'll see Master Zhenshi
safely out of the city.

179
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,170
Mr. Wei!

180
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,220
Thank you, thank you.

181
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,820
There is something
you may not know, Mr. Wei.

182
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,060
Farewell, Master Zhenshi.

183
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,100
Master Zhenshi was entrusted by His Lordship

184
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,890
to view the inscriptions in Yunzhong.

185
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,180
Yunzhong?

186
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,650
That's a small, barren corner

187
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,100
on Wei's border.

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
The road is long and winding.

189
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,010
He won't be back for months.

190
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,650
Sir, you may not know.

191
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,610
I passed through there on my travels.

192
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,460
They're rebuilding the roads over there.

193
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,980
He'll be gone much longer
than just a few months.

194
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,140
Is that so?

195
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,740
All the better.

196
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,100
It solves His Lordship's biggest problem.

197
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,820
(Wushan State)

198
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,060
Ehuang,

199
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,780
feeling better after the herbal soup?

200
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
We can't stay here much longer.

201
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,300
If we stay,

202
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,100
Chen Pang's men may catch up to us.

203
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,460
That physician's remedy is too mild.

204
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Find another physician,

205
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,220
the one who uses stronger doses.

206
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,660
We left in such a hurry,

207
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,900
money...

208
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,220
Money's a little tight.

209
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Who are you?

210
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,940
General Xue, for the late lord's will,

211
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,940
you've truly given your all.

212
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,140
You even

213
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,700
disguised yourself as a farmer.

214
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,060
His Lordship was kind to me.

215
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,100
It is only right I do all I can

216
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,620
to find you for him.

217
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,220
If that is so,

218
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,780
please allow me a moment, General Xue.

219
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,220
I'll go pack up

220
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,020
some clothes and valuables,

221
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
then return to Danjun with you.

222
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I shall confine myself

223
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,980
to Yulou Pavilion for life.

224
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,140
I swore to fulfill His Lordship's final wish,

225
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,980
but never to imprison you

226
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,500
in Yulou Pavilion.

227
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,700
Instead, I will honor your will

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,100
and keep you safe.

229
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,260
Once I die,

230
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,500
my uncle will surely seize power.

231
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,420
And I fear

232
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
he may bring harm to you

233
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,940
and Her Ladyship.

234
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,900
Her Ladyship

235
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,300
would be left all alone.

236
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,020
I swore to serve Her Ladyship
to the very end.

237
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,020
So it was never my husband

238
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,500
who meant to lock me in Yulou Pavilion.

239
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,660
It seems

240
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,620
I didn't marry the wrong man.

241
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,500
Please don't be sad, My Lady.

242
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
Wei State is soon to host

243
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,940
the Deer Hunt.

244
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,460
Its true purpose remains unclear.

245
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,750
Tensions stir beneath the surface
throughout the realm.

246
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,780
My Lady, please come back

247
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,180
to Juejun with me...

248
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,220
Are you saying

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,680
Wei is about to hold the Deer Hunt?

250
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,400
Lord of Wei is inviting all the great powers.

251
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,900
Governors and Prefects

252
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,780
from every region

253
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,010
will gather in Yujun.

254
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,420
Did you receive an invitation?

255
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,770
At present, Juejun has become

256
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,220
a land without order.

257
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,660
How could he possibly invite me?

258
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,260
This Qiao-Wei alliance

259
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,870
is much more stable than expected.

260
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,940
Qiao Yue scours the land for beauties,

261
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,340
claiming he means to

262
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,620
gift them to the Governors.

263
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,580
To find you,

264
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,680
I went alone to Kangjun just days ago.

265
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,980
The region is in turmoil.

266
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,100
My Lady, you should return with me

267
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,820
to Juejun as soon as possible.

268
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,180
I cannot return to Juejun with you.

269
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,740
Wei Shao is preparing the Deer Hunt,

270
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,180
inviting all the powers.

271
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,580
I intend to go to Yujun

272
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,580
to seek a way forward.

273
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,540
So, you mean

274
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,260
to remarry?

275
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,060
No.

276
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,220
My heart still belongs

277
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
to my late husband.

278
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,820
I ought to mourn him.

279
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,700
However,

280
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,340
rather than retreat into sorrow,

281
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,220
I would rather

282
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,620
stand and fight to fulfill

283
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,300
my late husband's final wish.

284
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,540
If Bianzhou falls to Chen Pang from now on,

285
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,540
my late husband

286
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,060
will never rest in peace.

287
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,860
I must go to Yujun,

288
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,340
find another way out,

289
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,340
and reclaim Bianzhou.

290
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,620
I once vowed to His Lordship

291
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,060
to serve you to the very end.

292
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,180
I'll give my life if needed

293
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,980
to keep you safe and sound.

294
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,220
I command 50,000 elite soldiers in Juejun.

295
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,860
This is the military tally.

296
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,660
(Xue Tai, Juejun)

297
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,220
We're at your command, My Lady.

298
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,220
(Xue Tai, Juejun)

299
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,180
The ceremony begins.

300
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,660
Please step forward, Your Ladyship.

301
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,820
Purify your hands.

302
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,780
By Heaven-Earth's divine craft,

303
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,340
we prosper in joy and harmony.

304
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,220
Where golden wheat grows abundant,

305
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,900
there yeast and grain unite.

306
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,020
Through sages' enlightened wisdom,

307
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
a thousand vessels transform.

308
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,620
With divine blessings' guidance,

309
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,140
grace flows through all ages.

310
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,900
We honor Heaven, Earth and our ancestors

311
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,700
for protecting Wei State
and blessing us with a bountiful harvest.

312
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,060
The new brew has been made.

313
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,020
(Re-Brew, Full Ripening, Yeast Binding)
Today, the casks open.

314
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,740
Your Ladyship,

315
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,100
the people have brewed this using rice

316
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,180
freshly harvested this year.

317
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,900
Please have a taste

318
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,980
choose the finest,

319
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,300
and celebrate with the people.

320
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,940
Your Ladyship, please taste the new brew

321
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,580
and celebrate with us all!

322
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,300
Your Ladyship.

323
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,540
Thank you, Your Lordship.

324
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,100
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

325
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,340
Would you dance with us, My Lady?

326
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,340
I...

327
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,380
Advisor.

328
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,060
Xiaotao,

329
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,540
can we...

330
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,380
No way.

331
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,380
I haven't said anything yet.

332
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,260
Still no.

333
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,300
(Soil-God Shrine)
Thank you for celebrating with us, My Lord.

334
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,540
And thank you all.

335
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,900
Today is New Year's Day.

336
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,140
Hurry home and reunite with your families.

337
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,900
Thank you, My Lord.

338
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,340
The path is muddy.

339
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,900
I'll carry you.

340
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,900
Climb on.

341
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,340
How could I ride on your back, My Lord?

342
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,180
All my days to come,

343
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,540
you alone hold my reins.

344
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,740
Come on.

345
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,780
You've worked hard

346
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,500
preparing for the ceremony these days.

347
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,820
Go home early today.

348
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,740
I'll wait for you.

349
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,340
Alright.

350
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,860
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

351
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,740
I've never seen snow with His Lordship.

352
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,300
Mr. Wei.

353
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,900
Lady Qiao.

354
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,500
I didn't expect you
to prepare a festival gift for me.

355
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,700
I really like it.

356
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,380
I gave everyone in the household a gift,

357
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,820
including you, Mr. Wei.

358
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,900
I've also prepared one for you.

359
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,460
Go ahead, open it.

360
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,700
It's an incense warmer.

361
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

362
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,740
I heard the Soil-God Shine Ceremony
was especially lively this year.

363
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,620
You didn't attend?

364
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,100
I thought you'd know.

365
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,420
Snow is rare

366
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,780
in Kangjun, isn't it?

367
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,780
It's colder here than in Kangjun.

368
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,380
It rains a lot back there.

369
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,540
You know what?

370
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,830
When we were children,

371
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,940
Zhonglin and I loved snowy days the most.

372
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,380
Because it meant
we didn't have to rise early to drills.

373
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,340
And we could

374
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,580
go hunting hares.

375
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,340
Back then,

376
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,540
Zhonglin was timid.

377
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,380
Even when he caught one, he couldn't kill it.

378
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,180
He would always sneak it back.

379
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,420
His Lordship has a kind heart.

380
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,500
If you're leaving,

381
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,940
please take this path.

382
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,900
Then I'll take my leave here.

383
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,220
Alright.

384
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,560
Thank you for the gift, Mr. Wei.

385
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,220
I'm glad you like it.

386
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,420
I'm glad you like it.

387
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,660
It's a thoughtful gift.

388
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,580
It happens to be what you like, My Lady.

389
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,460
The others were fine too.

390
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,180
All these gifts are quite valuable.

391
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,220
It shows both Lady Xu and Lady Zhu

392
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,940
hold Her Ladyship in high regard.

393
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
The more distant

394
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,740
the tie, the more lavish the gift.

395
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,420
If it were Lady Ding,

396
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,290
she'd go to great lengths to find something

397
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,660
that truly suits Her Ladyship,

398
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,780
not just throw silver at it.

399
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,380
Grandmother and Mother
are willing to spend on me.

400
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,020
That shows their kindness toward me.

401
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,620
No need to compare them to Aunt.

402
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,620
I grew up under her care.

403
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,220
She absolutely knows best what I like.

404
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,510
But if I wish Grandmother and Mother

405
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,980
to treat me as their own,

406
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,140
we'll need more time together.

407
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,660
I wonder

408
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,860
how Aunt and the others are doing now.

409
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,340
How do they celebrate the New Year?

410
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,980
My Lord.

411
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,060
I saw people setting boat lanterns

412
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,460
on the way here.

413
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,580
So,

414
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,420
I thought you'd be into

415
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,780
these flashy little things.

416
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,500
Yeah,

417
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,780
I do enjoy such shallow pleasures.

418
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,100
Let's go take a look.

419
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,420
Hello, would you like

420
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,260
to set boat lanterns?

421
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,620
We've got brushes and ink over there.

422
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
You may write your wishes

423
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,980
upon the boat lanterns.

424
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,340
As they drift downstream,

425
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,860
the River God will receive your prayers.

426
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,700
It's really magical.

427
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,300
If a single boat lantern could grant wishes,

428
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,100
surely peace would have come long ago.

429
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,620
Don't ruin the mood, will you?

430
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
I'll take two.

431
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,460
No problem.

432
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,940
Here you go.

433
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,260
No need, you go ahead.

434
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,100
I don't need one.

435
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,180
I'm not into this.

436
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,820
Sincerity brings miracles.

437
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,860
Sir, it doesn't cost that much.

438
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,060
It's fine. Keep the change.

439
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,180
Sir.

440
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
This is for you.

441
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
Okay. Thank you.

442
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,860
Take care.

443
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,260

Let's go home.

479
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,740
Alright, you go ahead.

480
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,460
I'll go handle some work at the office.

481
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,940
You're working this late?

482
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,780
Yes. It just came to mind.

483
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,460
I'll have Tan escort you back.

484
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,700
Tan.

485
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,940
Escort Her Ladyship back.

486
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,020
Yes, My Lord.

487
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,500
I'll take my leave then.

488
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420
Alright.

489
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,220
Aren't you leaving, My Lord?

490
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,140
You go ahead. I won't be long.

491
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,780
Check over there.

492
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,740
My Lord,

493
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,600
we're skilled

494
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,900
with weapons, but fishing lanterns

495
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,980
out in this cold is a different story.

496
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,220
Shut up. Just do it.

497
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,540
Bring that one over.

498
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,980
My Lord.

499
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,420
My Lord,

500
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,460
may I offer a small,

501
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,820
tiny suggestion?

502
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,220
These are people's wishes.

503
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,300
If you tear them open,
the wishes won't come true.

504
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,020
What?

505
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,220
Whose side are you on?

506
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,380
You don't even try to hide it now.

507
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,180
Ever since he gave that gold dart

508
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,140
to Xiaotao, he's been

509
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,220
acting all sentimental.

510
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,140
That's not true!

511
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,420
Keep searching.

512
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,580
Bring that one over.

513
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,580
My Lord.

514
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,860
I'm the Lord of Wei.

515
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,500
I must understand

516
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,020
what the people think

517
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,180
and what they wish for.

518
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,300
And more importantly,
what Her Ladyship wishes for.

519
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
Why are you staring at me?

520
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,700
You're just making excuses.

521
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,140
That one looks right. Fish it out.

522
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
My Lord.

523
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,580
Yes, this is the one.

524
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,100
"May Yanzhou enjoy peace and prosperity.

525
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,700
May Aunt and Uncle have smooth days ahead.

526
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,340
May Father stay in good health.

527
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,220
May Ci succeed in his studies.

528
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,900
May Cousin and Bi Zhi grow old together."

529
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,860
One person is missing.

530
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,660
No, everyone's here.

531
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,700
No, someone's missing.

532
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,780
Who's missing?

533
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,940
Qiao Gui.

534
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,820
Her Ladyship only cares about those few.

535
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,060
Let's go back.

536
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,860
My Lord, aren't we going to
check the rest of the wishes?

537
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,500
She didn't mention him.

538
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,900
You're back, My Lord.

539
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,260
Good. I want to ask you something.

540
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,780
Some ladies from the clan

541
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,220
will visit Grandmother tomorrow.

542
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,660
What gifts should I prepare for them?

543
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,060
It's my first time doing this in the Wei...

544
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,700
What's wrong?

545
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,300
You're burning up.

546
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,660
I'll get the physician.

547
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,900
No need.

548
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,420
Just caught a chill

549
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,380
sleeping on the couch.

550
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,260
It's happened before.

551
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,940
You just never noticed.

552
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,340
You should've told me sooner.

553
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,180
Then tonight, you take the bed,
I'll have the couch.

554
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,780
No need for that.

555
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,860
Instead of arguing over the bed and couch,

556
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,900
why not focus on

557
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,620
getting me well soon?

558
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,300
Don't go to the Government Office tomorrow.

559
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,780
Stay home.

560
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,020
Let me nurse you back to health.

561
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,940
Ehuang.

562
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,380
The herbal soup's here.

563
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,500
This dose is strong.

564
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,580
It works fast but can be harsh on the body.

565
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,460
This one is mild.

566
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,620
It works slower

567
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,620
but much gentler.

568
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,020
What do you think?

569
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,380
Which one will you take?

570
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,740
Ehuang!

571
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,380
You...

572
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,460
I must fully recover

573
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,820
to meet the Lord of Wei.

574
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,140
I'm thirsty.

575
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,340
I want some water.

576
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,180
Didn't you say you'd nurse me today?

577
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,620
Tao, my daughter,

578
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,780
listen to me.

579
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,740
When you're with General Wei Liang,
hold back a little.

580
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,820
Don't be too forward.

581
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,900
Why?

582
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,260
The more forward a woman is,
the more she ends up losing.

583
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,670
My Lord.

584
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,100
Can't you say things straight?

585
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
Why go in circles?

586
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,260
Men of the Wei family

587
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,540
never beat around the bush.

588
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,180
You are right, My Lord.

589
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,340
Why are you up, My Lord?

590
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,860
I need to go out.

591
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,340
But you're still sick.

592
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Anger cured me.

593
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,100
(Government Office)

594
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,940
I'm so sleepy.

595
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,420
Don't be.

596
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,260
- What...
- We're on duty here.

597
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,180
Xiaotao, what are you doing here?

598
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,020
Came to see me, huh?

599
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,980
Get lost.

600
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm here to see you.

601
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,060
Me? Really?

602
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,580
You could've just sent word.

603
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,740
I would've come to you.

604
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,220
No need to come all this way.

605
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,740
Wouldn't that be more trouble?

606
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,980
Alright, let me ask you.

607
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,180
What's wrong with His Lordship today?

608
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,100
His Lordship?

609
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,740
He's discussing affairs with Advisor in there.

610
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,380
No way.

611
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,540
Her Ladyship said

612
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,140
he's been acting strange since he

613
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,100
returned last night.

614
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,780
Every time you come,

615
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,620
you always ask about His Lordship.

616
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,700
Is that all you care about?

617
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,180
Actually, no.

618
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,140
- Oh?
- Come here.

619
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,060
- What is it?
- Remember that gold dart you gave me?

620
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,060
I've got a little something for you too.

621
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
- Really?
- Let me see, come on.

622
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,460
Keep it down.

623
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
Let me see.

624
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,580
I haven't got it ready yet.

625
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,580
Alright, alright.

626
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,620
So tell me, what's wrong with His Lordship?

627
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,180
Let me think…

628
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,020
Oh, I got it.

629
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,060
But don't tell Her Ladyship.

630
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,940
Don't worry, I won't say a word.

631
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,380
Last night,

632
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,100
His Lordship took the four of us

633
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,540
on a very long walk

634
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,580
to find a boat lantern.

635
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
At last, we found Her Ladyship's lantern.

636
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,380
After he opened and read it, his mood soured.

637
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,860
It must've been because of that.

638
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,060
I see.

639
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,460
Don't let Her Ladyship know.

640
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,580
Relax, I won't.

641
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,820
See you then.

642
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,460
Take care.

643
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,180
Take care, Tao.

644
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,940
I think we should tell Her Ladyship.

645
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,660
True.

646
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,180
It's fine.

647
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,420
Xiaotao never listens to me.

648
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,620
I know her well.

649
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,580
Show me the gift she plans to give you.

650
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,260
So that's the reason.

651
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,340
No wonder he's angry.

652
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,820
My Lady,

653
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,260
you wouldn't even

654
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,580
write His Lordship's name?

655
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,260
I think His Lordship is being petty.

656
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,060
But look, Her Ladyship
prepared all his favorite dishes

657
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,100
to apologize.

658
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,500
It's not his fault.

659
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,500
I was the one who mishandled it.

660
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,900
Then you really need to make it up to him.

661
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,820
It seems he truly took it to heart.

662
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,620
His Lordship

663
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,260
does tend to hold a grudge.

664
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,500
You'll need to come up with
something special.

665
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,820
I'll go warm this up.

666
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,020
- Xiaozao.
- My Lord.

667
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,180
Why are you in such a rush?

668
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,700
You're finally back, My Lord.

669
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,540
Her Ladyship is...

670
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,730
What about her?

671
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,420
Her Ladyship waited so long for you.

672
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,540
Now, she's drunk.

673
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,980
Who says I'm drunk?

674
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,340
My Lord!

675
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,020
You're back!

676
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
You all serve Her Ladyship.

677
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,820
How could you let her drink like this?

678
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,060
This is disgraceful.

679
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Yes, My Lord.

680
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,220
It's my fault.

681
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,740
It won't happen again.

682
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,900
Where are you going?

683
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,460
Come back!

684
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,580
Come back here!

685
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,420
I said, come back!

686
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,980
Come back!

687
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
Stop right there.

688
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,220
Come back here.

689
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,340
Don't move.

690
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,980
Sit down, sit down.

691
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Lie down, lie down.

692
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Can you please stop being angry, My Lord?

693
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,420
Water.

694
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,460
I want some water.

695
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,180
Wait here.

696
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,900
Here, sit up and drink.

697
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
Hey, wake up.

698
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,700
Wake up. Water's here.

699
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,940
Do you want more?

700
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,700
You can't hold it. Don't drink so much.

701
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,020
My Lord, you're a true gentleman.

702
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,020
How can you be so petty?

703
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,060
I know you're angry

704
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,580
because you feel I don't love you back.

705
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,220
What you wrote was a wish,

706
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,300
while what I wrote was regret.

707
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,860
You're right here,

708
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,420
close enough to touch.

709
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,180
But I can only send my family
well wishes from afar.

710
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,660
That's why I only wrote about them,

711
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,140
and not you, My Lord.
