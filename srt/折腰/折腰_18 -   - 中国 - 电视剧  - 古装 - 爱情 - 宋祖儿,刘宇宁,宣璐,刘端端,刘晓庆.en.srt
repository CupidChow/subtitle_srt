Even so,

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,060
I'll agree to neither of them.

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,780
Goodbye, My Lady.

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,620
Alright.

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,060
Let's go.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,500
Father, goodbye.

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,780
Lady Qiao left the prefect's mansion

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,300
with a big smile.

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,140
Right after,
they went to a jewelry shop,

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,660
saying they wanted to make

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,380
a full set of gold and silver
wedding jewelry.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,860
Ask Yuan Wang to come and see me.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,140
Yes.

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,180
General, may I ask

44
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,380
why you summoned me so late?

45
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,420
Today, I received a Go board

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,100
and a bridal hair ornament.

47
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
Prefect, please take a look.

48
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,300
See if they match

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,980
what Lady Qiao promised you.

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,860
General, you truly misunderstood.

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,100
Her Ladyship did stop by today to discuss

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,300
a marriage for my daughter.

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,700
Out of respect for our families' agreement

54
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,560
I neither accepted

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,900
nor made any promises.

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,820
Prefect, save your excuses

57
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,620
for simpletons.

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,700
Even if nothing came of today,

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,540
what about the silver
and gold sent late at night?

60
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,540
You didn't turn that away,

61
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,700
did you?

62
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Silver and gold? Sent at night?

63
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,700
General,

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,740
what do yo mean?

65
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Prefect,

66
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,820
drop the act.

67
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,180
I have already set guards
outside your mansion day and night.

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,140
Everything between you two

69
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,260
has been seen clearly.

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,100
You...

71
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,020
You had me watched?

72
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,860
I've honored our agreement

73
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,820
and never betrayed you.

74
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,740
This is how you see me?
How you guard against me?

75
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,900
Is this your idea of sincere cooperation?

76
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,580
Don't forget, my troops
are garrisoned in Rongjun,

77
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
to keep your family safe.

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,460
That's ridiculous!

79
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,300
Our Yuan family has been rooted
in Rongjun for a century.

80
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,620
Why would we need your protection?

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,420
Your so-called garrison here is nothing

82
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,140
more than a leash to keep me in check.

83
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,140
I should've seen this sooner.

84
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,140
But better late than never!

85
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,260
So, betrayal was your intention all along?

86
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,980
Says the one with hidden motives!

87
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,180
And what if I do?

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,420
Rongjun Prefect left Rongjun in the night,

89
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,500
heading to Wei Dian's place.

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,180
The timing couldn't be better.

91
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
All we need is one final push.

92
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
The arrows we collected

93
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,740
during the previous ambush

94
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,020
can finally be put to use.

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,580
Very good.

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,180
I'll go myself later.

97
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,820
My Lord?

98
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,060
My wound is healed.

99
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,380
I know my body better than anyone.

100
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,580
I've been stuck in bed for days now.

101
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,380
You won't let me do anything.

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,820
I've got it from now on.

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
You can't go.

104
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I said, I'm fine.

105
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,580
Don't I know my own condition?

106
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,740
You don't.

107
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,820
Wei Qu, what do you say?

108
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,060
Am I fine or not?

109
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,020
So, Wei Qu,

110
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,940
can you really call this fine?

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,140
Just say it.

112
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,500
Right now,

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,380
I'm not feeling well.

114
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,620
Get back here.

115
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,420
That's enough.

116
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,740
No army sends a foot soldier

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,500
while the commander shows up in person.

118
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,420
You can strategize from this very room.

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,620
What's going on?

120
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,100
You...

121
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,380
Who are you people?

122
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,620
How dare you attack me on the street?

123
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,260
You betrayed the General.

124
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,260
Have you thought about

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,180
what will happen to you?

126
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,660
Kill him.

127
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,940
General Wei Liang! Save me!

128
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,060
Wei Dian,

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,740
I knew it was you.

130
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
That was too harsh.

131
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,740
Look how scared he is.

132
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,010
Feeling sorry for him, are you?

133
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,230
You almost cut my club in half,

134
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,580
- you know?
- Had to make it real.

135
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,420
Fine, you big oaf.

136
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,350
I'll remember this.

137
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,820
Alright, enough.

138
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,180
Let me help you!

139
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,180
That's not loud enough!

140
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
Stop!

141
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,500
General, you...

142
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,700
Are you alright?

143
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,820
I'm fine, I'm fine.

144
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,740
Your face is covered in blood.

145
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,540
It's nothing. It's their blood.

146
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
Is it?

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,140
That's good.

148
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,140
What a relief.

149
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,380
Thank you for saving my life, General.

150
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,300
If not for you,

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,140
I...

152
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,620
I'd be dead.

153
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,180
Prefect,

154
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,500
who have you offended?

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Who wants you dead?

156
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,500
It's a long story.

157
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,220
General Wei Liang,

158
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,180
I need to see Her Ladyship.

159
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,260
General!

160
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,100
Bad news!

161
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,740
General, Rongjun Prefect
has openly declared his support

162
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,060
for planting winter wheat.

163
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,820
He's even rallied the people.

164
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,380
Many have already joined him.

165
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,620
People are lining up for seeds

166
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,060
outside every house now.

167
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,700
General!

168
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
General,

169
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,180
Yuan Wang knows so many of our plans.

170
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,260
Do you think he'll betray us to Wei Shao?

171
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,860
Even if he says nothing,

172
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,580
Wei Shao could still

173
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,140
connect it to me.

174
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,740
All these years, he hasn't

175
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,140
moved against me, not because he didn't

176
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,620
want to, but he didn't dare.

177
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,620
So, how about

178
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,740
we strike first?

179
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,140
Back in the mourning hall,

180
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,340
I should've acted.

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,020
General,

182
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,900
it's not too late to decide now.

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
If canal construction is finalized,

184
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,380
we'll be held back in the future.

185
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,140
They came for the canal and the grain.

186
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,860
They don't have much manpower.

187
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,020
So, that's it?

188
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,380
Only a little force in Rongjun?

189
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,380
Pass on my command.

190
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,740
Gather the troops.

191
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,820
We depart at once.

192
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,500
Yes, General.

193
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,140
Wei Shao, you brat!

194
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,740
Once I'm armored up,

195
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,660
I'll have it out with you!

196
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,260
Why bother with a tough fight?

197
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,500
One slash settles it.

198
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,860
Have a good rest.

199
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,460
From this day forward,

200
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,220
Wei Dian's former troops
are spared from death.

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,860
They will be reassigned

202
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,620
to work on the canal.

203
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,020
Once it's complete,

204
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,380
all past offenses will be pardoned.

205
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,900
Thank you, My Lord.

206
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,100
Greetings, My Lord.

207
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,140
Prefect, you've worked hard.

208
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Now that the wheat seeds

209
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,980
are in the hands of the people,

210
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,780
and we have laborers for the task,

211
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,540
the canal will surely

212
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
be completed.

213
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Rongjun shall offer
its full strength in support.

214
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,340
However, this land

215
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,780
has long suffered from drought.

216
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,140
We lack experience

217
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,260
in building canals.

218
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,100
Don't worry,

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,220
I've already found the right person

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
to oversee it.

221
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,380
I've worked in flood control for many years.

222
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Now,

223
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,540
the Yongning Canal has been rebuilt,

224
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,620
stretching all the way to Rongjun.

225
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,740
This is a project

226
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,620
for the benefit of generations to come!

227
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,620
Her Ladyship and His Lordship
trust me so deeply.

228
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,540
I will not let them down.

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,780
I'll give it my all.

230
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,740
Mayor,

231
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,100
you've been talking all the way.

232
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,540
You've helped with
the Yongning Canal more than once.

233
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,140
It's just one more trip there.

234
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,780
Why are you so excited?

235
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,620
You don't understand.

236
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,660
Back in my youth,
I used to debate with Zhen Zhi,

237
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,740
if the Yongning Canal were to go

238
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,780
beyond just Panyi and Xindu,

239
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,540
where should it lead?

240
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,260
Looking at your face

241
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,780
reminds me so much of Zhen Zhi.

242
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,860
The construction of Yongning Canal,

243
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,140
meant to bring prosperity to both our peoples,

244
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,860
wouldn't be the same with the wrong partner.

245
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,380
There'd be no joy in it.

246
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,260
Never mind, forget it.

247
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,260
I've distanced myself from Xindu

248
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,460
and from Zhen Zhi.

249
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
I still don't know

250
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,020
who I'll be working with on this task.

251
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,860
I'm not questioning

252
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,460
Her Ladyship or His Lordship's judgement.

253
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,980
I just want the chance to prove
what I'm capable of.

254
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,780
You'll see once we arrive, Mayor.

255
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,020
Zhen Zhi?

256
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
- Goodbye.
- But you just got here.

257
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
General, you may not know this,

258
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,380
but I've never gotten along

259
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,500
with that man.

260
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,740
And frankly, I don't
get along with you either.

261
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,780
Back then, we swore we'd never

262
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,380
cross paths again in this lifetime.

263
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,380
If not for

264
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,660
His Lordship's orders that I oversee you,

265
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,620
I wouldn't have come at all.

266
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,380
You? Oversee me?

267
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,020
Come on, Zhen Zhi.

268
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,380
You took twice as long as I did

269
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,220
to build the canal in Xindu,

270
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,620
and now you're going to oversee me?

271
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,540
What a joke. I've got nothing more to say.

272
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,380
General,

273
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,740
you truly don't understand.

274
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,380
I just can't work with him.

275
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,260
It's not that I won't serve Lord of Wei.

276
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,460
I'd like anyone else to oversee me.

277
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,300
I'm leaving.

278
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,140
Why are you doing?

279
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
What do you want?

280
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,020
Look.

281
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,990
Look for yourself.

282
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,860
Is this how you ask someone for help?

283
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,140
Don't waste your breath on him.

284
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,340
This person is pure Qiao clan
through and through,

285
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
smooth with his words,

286
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,980
but sneaky with his actions.

287
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,220
If you want him to work,

288
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,260
force him.

289
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,540
You shut your mouth.

290
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,860
Every time you open it,

291
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,500
it stinks. I'm leaving anyway.

292
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,340
Mayors.

293
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,020
Greetings, My Lord.

294
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,260
Greetings, Lord of Wei.

295
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,780
No need for formalities.

296
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,020
Fourteen years ago,

297
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,260
you both served my Grandfather.

298
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,660
Together with Lord Qiao,

299
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,660
you built the Yongning Canal,

300
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,900
diverting the Yang River to the Pei River,

301
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,140
ending the drought that struck Wei State.

302
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,380
Now, fourteen years later,

303
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,020
the canal flows again,

304
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,140
thanks to both of you.

305
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
But now,

306
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,860
Rongjun faces

307
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,100
the same hardship.

308
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,500
I seek to follow my ancestor's path

309
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,620
and build a new canal.

310
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,140
The Yongning Canal

311
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,260
benefited only Yanzhou and Wei State.

312
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,980
As Xindu and Rongjun

313
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,020
border Bianzhou,

314
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
if we succeed,

315
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,380
folk in Bianzhou will benefit as well.

316
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,460
This time,

317
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,260
we set aside borders

318
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,220
and act for the people.

319
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
This is a great cause for the good of all.

320
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
So, I entrust this task

321
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,500
to you both.

322
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,740
I hope you can work in unity to relieve

323
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,140
the people from the pain of drought.

324
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,460
Here and now,

325
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,540
you have my deepest thanks.

326
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,340
- I will do my utmost.
- I will do my utmost.

327
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,620
My Lord, urgent news.

328
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Bianzhou has changed hands.

329
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,260
(Chen Xiang died in Danjun)
Governor of Bianzhou

330
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,100
(Chen Pang takes over.)
died.

331
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,180
(Bianzhou's border, Bianzhou)

332
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
Any women in the cart?

333
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,900
My sister and I are returning home
after visiting relatives.

334
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,020
We're just passing through.

335
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,100
May I ask what you want, officers?

336
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,380
No, officer...

337
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,340
Officers, is there

338
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,500
something you require?

339
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,980
Nothing.

340
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Forgive me

341
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,620
for asking, officers.

342
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,900
There are checkpoints along the way,

343
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,020
and searches even stricter.

344
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,860
Are you searching for

345
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,740
someone dangerous?

346
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,140
Not exactly. We're following

347
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,520
General Xue's orders

348
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,500
to find Lady Yulou.

349
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,460
Lady Yulou?

350
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,620
If you see her,

351
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,540
report it at once.

352
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,140
General Xue will reward you well.

353
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
May I ask, which General Xue?

354
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,220
Chen Pang has seized power.

355
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,380
Xue Tai, General of Longxiang

356
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,980
in Juejun, has rebelled.

357
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,500
We follow our late lord's orders

358
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
seeking Lady Yulou,

359
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,340
to keep her safe...

360
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,460
No need to say more.

361
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,620
We have duties to attend to.

362
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,220
Ma'am, best you be on your way.

363
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,740
Thank you, officers.

364
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,580
Let's go.

365
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,740
Thanks to you both.

366
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,740
Ehuang, Xue Tai doesn't
accept Chen Pang's rule.

367
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Why don't we go to him?

368
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,140
Maybe we can do something.

369
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,620
Don't be reckless again.

370
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,500
Xue Tai is blindly loyal.

371
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,620
He's only

372
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,500
fulfilling Chen Xiang's final wish now.

373
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,100
Claiming to keep me safe

374
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,860
is just for his own reputation.

375
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,740
We should go.

376
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,620
Alright.

377
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,740
Bring me some water.

378
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,100
I need to wipe my face.

379
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,700
Yes.

380
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,460
Ehuang...

381
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,900
Ehuang, don't draw that.

382
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,540
If they find you, they'll

383
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,340
send you back to Yulou Pavilion.

384
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,780
Once we pass Bianzhou, it's Wushan State.

385
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,060
They won't chase us there.

386
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,980
Ehuang, you know

387
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,740
we're arriving at Wushan State.

388
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,540
We have achieved nothing.

389
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,820
How can we return home?

390
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,180
The Su clan of Wushan State

391
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,580
has treated you well all these years.

392
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,580
If not by adoption,

393
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,340
you could at least have formed

394
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,420
an alliance with Bianzhou.

395
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,980
Now Chen Xiang is dead, and Chen Pang

396
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,580
has turned his back on us.

397
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,180
We have nothing left.

398
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,340
If the family blames me,

399
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,900
how am I supposed to explain?

400
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,540
At the end of the day,

401
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,940
you're just a woman.

402
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,260
Painting a penoy doesn't help...

403
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,540
You think I want this?

404
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
So?

405
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,500
Now that I've fallen,

406
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,300
you come to lecture me?

407
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,140
I wouldn't dare.

408
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,940
Don't you forget,

409
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
you've worked with me
away from home for years.

410
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,260
Whether you'll be the heir back at Su family

411
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,300
is still uncertain.

412
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,660
Pull yourself together!

413
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,820
We're in the same boat.

414
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,660
This huadian I wear

415
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,940
protects more than just myself.

416
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,140
Yes.

417
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,900
(Post House)

418
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,660
I solved you a problem, My Lord.

419
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,500
Is there any reward for me?

420
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,740
Reward?

421
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,060
When Wei Liang faked a marriage proposal

422
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,500
you made a set of gold jewelry.

423
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,260
It's yours now.

424
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,540
When you were ill,

425
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,020
I took such good care of you.

426
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,540
I even schemed to split
Yuan Wang and Wei Dian.

427
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,580
All my efforts were for you.

428
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,500
Now, you're giving me the gift

429
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,740
meant for someone else?

430
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,100
Then what do you want?

431
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,500
My Lord,

432
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,100
haven't you ever thought

433
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,700
of giving me something special?

434
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,580
What a hassle.

435
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll think about it.

436
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
Why the sudden mood to take us

437
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,940
to the market, My Lord?

438
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,100
I just want to show you

439
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,180
local customs and sights.

440
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,780
As the lord, and you as generals, we should

441
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,220
care about such things.

442
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,740
Yes, My Lord.

443
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,260
We can also buy some local specialties.

444
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,940
Local specialties?

445
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,780
For whom?

446
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,180
Advisor is still guarding Yujun.

447
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,460
You need to wise up.

448
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,420
For Advisor?

449
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,900
A fine ink slab should do.

450
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,580
I suppose

451
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,460
Grandmother would

452
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,060
surely enjoy Rongjun's specialties.

453
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,300
We can bring Lady Xu some ginseng.

454
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,580
What about Yan?

455
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,760
Every time he goes out,

456
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,260
he always brings you gifts.

457
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,020
That's easy. Some wine will do.

458
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,860
Right?

459
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,260
But there's still one more person.

460
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,060
This time, Her Ladyship

461
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,340
played no small role.

462
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,100
She deserves a reward too.

463
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,740
Sure. Got it, My Lord.

464
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,500
Still buying gifts for the others?

465
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,740
My mother says all women love sweets.

466
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,020
We can't get these in Yujun,

467
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,300
perfect for Her Ladyship.

468
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,100
That's lame.

469
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,020
A jade hairpin,

470
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,500
a jingling hairpin with white pearls,

471
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,170
and a kingfisher-blue pin.

472
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,020
I swear, any one

473
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,980
of these would win

474
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,820
her heart instantly.

475
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,740
That's tacky.

476
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,340
That's jewelry!

477
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,700
No ladies would say no to that!

478
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,940
My Lord, Xiaotao told me

479
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,580
Her Ladyship could read by three
and recite poetry by five.

480
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,940
A book would be a good gift.

481
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,100
She could read by three, remember?

482
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,260
How should I know
what she hasn't already read?

483
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,260
I think I know what she likes.

484
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,500
This is for you.

485
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
What's this?

486
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,820
Steeds.

487
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,300
Five hundred of them.

488
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,660
(Five hundred fine steeds for Yanzhou.)

489
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,780
Steeds?

490
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,500
This canal construction

491
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,500
is a favor Wei owes Yanzhou.

492
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,100
These five hundred steeds

493
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,020
make it even.

494
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,980
My Lord, what do you think

495
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,780
why would I risk everything

496
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,460
and go through all this?

497
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,020
I understand your intentions.

498
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
Yanzhou truly wishes to ally with Wei.

499
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,100
I was too narrow-minded before.

500
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,500
(Five hundred)
But now,

501
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
I see your sincerity.

502
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,700
What do you think you're seeing?

503
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,580
What?

504
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,460
You don't like steeds?

505
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,660
I can exchange them.

506
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,780
How about weapons?

507
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,020
Battering rams?

508
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,020
Catapults? Or armor...

509
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,100
Enough. No need.

510
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,500
I like steeds.

511
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,780
They're good.

512
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,740
Horses, huh?

513
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,020
Right?

514
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,460
I can tell,

515
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,780
you do like them.

516
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,980
I really do.

517
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,820
Great.

518
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
I do like them.

519
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,020
Steeds are great.

520
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
My Lady.

521
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,700
Duang told me

522
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,820
His Lordship gave you five hundred steeds.

523
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,900
Is that true?

524
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,220
His Lordship

525
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,300
is so generous!

526
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,020
I just don't get it.

527
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,700
Tell me, what kind of man

528
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,260
gives his wife steeds as a gift?

529
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,700
But they're practical.

530
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,340
Send them straight back to Yanzhou.

531
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,540
Not everyone can afford such a gift.

532
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,900
Now that's a proper gift

533
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,020
from His Lordship.

534
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,420
Not sure if his wife likes it,
but his father-in-law

535
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,900
must be over the moon.

536
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
He really knows how to win favor.

537
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,820
Speaking of gifts,

538
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,740
has Wei Liang ever given you anything?

539
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,260
Here, this is for you.

540
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,420
Why bring him up, My Lady?

541
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,580
Xiaotao.

542
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,980
My Lady, please don't be upset.

543
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,900
It takes time.

544
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,260
You two just need more time together.

545
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,380
Chunniang,

546
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,260
make me some red bean soup.

547
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,340
Yes, My Lady.

548
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,540
What is that, My Lady?

549
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,780
I thought you might be hungry,

550
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,660
so I brought some sweets.

551
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,900
What is that?

552
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
It smells so good.

553
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,980
It's golden osmanthus incense.

554
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,220
I used it earlier.

555
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,820
I see, it's the incense.

556
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,260
I thought the smell was from the sweets.

557
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,660
Next time, add some osmanthus.

558
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,580
It'll taste better.

559
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,420
My Lord, you have grown thinner

560
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,460
working so hard on the canal.

561
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,580
It's fine.

562
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,540
This is for people's livelihood.

563
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,460
I can't slack off.

564
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,980
That's true.

565
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,260
Canal construction may seem simple,

566
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,220
but there's much to take into account.

567
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,340
Weather alone, sunny or cloudy,

568
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,740
cold or warm,

569
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,820
can all affect progress.

570
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,260
That much?

571
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,780
Yes.

572
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,540
Back in Yanzhou,

573
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,900
before any digging began,

574
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,980
Grandfather and Uncle would observe the stars

575
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,220
to forecast the weather months in advance.

576
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,420
That's how the work went so smoothly.

577
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,060
But Yang Feng never mentioned

578
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,220
any of that.

579
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,500
He doesn't know that?

580
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,700
Grandfather and Uncle must've

581
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,020
observed the stars themselves.

582
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,900
That's why the overseers weren't aware.

583
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,300
Luckily,

584
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,900
Grandfather taught me well.

585
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,420
I know a bit about star signs.

586
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Shall I join you tonight

587
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,540
to observe them?

588
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,350
That's a good idea.

589
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,540
Let's do it tonight.

590
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,740
Meet me at the observatory at the Xu hour.

591
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,020
I'll find you when I'm done.

592
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,340
Okay.

593
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,220
My Lady, the wind's strong.

594
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,260
You should put this on.

595
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,100
I'm not wearing it.

596
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,180
It will hide my dress. I'm not wearing it.

597
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,740
Is my hair messy?

598
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,580
No.

599
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,220
I told you,
I shouldn't wear this jade hairpin.

600
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,260
The other one was better.

601
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,780
It's so dark out here. He can't see it.

602
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,540
Don't worry, My Lady.

603
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
It's clear enough to see.

604
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
But,

605
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,780
you and His Lordship have been

606
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,580
spending time together for a while now.

607
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,020
Why are you more nervous than ever?

608
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,620
My Lord.

609
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,260
You can't dress like that in this cold.

610
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,180
Why didn't you wear the cloak you brought?

611
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,060
I... I don't want to wear it.

612
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,220
I don't like wearing it.

613
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,100
You'll catch a cold.

614
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,540
- Put it on.
- I'm not wearing it.

615
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,020
I'm not cold.

616
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,880
Just put it on.

617
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,740
Listen to me.

618
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,140
There. Not cold anymore, huh?

619
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,740
Let's look at the stars.

620
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
Alright.

621
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,940
My Lord,

622
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,740
do you see that star up there?

623
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,580
Which one?

624
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,690
That one there.

625
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,020
The brightest one of all.

626
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,020
That's the Ziwei Star.

627
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,900
It's also called Taiyi.

628
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,580
Have you heard of the Five-Star Augury?

629
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,500
I've heard a bit.

630
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,980
The Five-Star Augury

631
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,820
interprets the movements of five stars...

632
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,820
Do you have something on your mind?

633
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,980
No, not really.

634
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,940
It's just that...

635
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,700
I'm sorry for being late.

636
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,380
It's fine.

637
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,020
Lord of Wei, My Lady.

638
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,460
You said we should
watch stars before starting.

639
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,220
So, the overseers

640
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,460
must know the method

641
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,580
to plan ahead.

642
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,500
By the way, where is Xindu Mayor?

643
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,660
You mean Zhen Zhi?

644
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,220
Well, let's not

645
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,020
bring him up.

646
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,980
Lord of Wei, My Lady, what can I do for you?

647
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,260
I've worked with Lord Qiao

648
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,980
for years, so I know a bit

649
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,300
about stargazing.

650
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,220
That's perfect.

651
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,220
Just now, Her Ladyship
mentioned this Five-Star Augury.

652
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,340
Do you know about it?

653
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,020
The Five-Star Augury?

654
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,060
Yes, I know a little bit.

655
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,940
It's about eight thousand characters long,

656
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,260
but it's an important text

657
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,980
on stargazing.

658
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,460
It's divided into two parts.

659
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,500
The first part is about augury...

660
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,020
What's wrong?

661
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,260
My Lady, I believe you've already known it,

662
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,580
so I won't repeat it.

663
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,180
Since His Lordship wants to hear it,

664
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,420
please go ahead.

665
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,060
Don't mind me.

666
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,180
Yes, please continue.

667
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,180
Lord of Wei,

668
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
I just noticed

669
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,260
this observatory is old, worn,

670
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,460
and quite cramped.

671
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,420
I'm afraid

672
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
it can't really fit three people.

673
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,260
Two would be ideal.

674
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,500
What are you talking about?

675
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
It's... It's not cramped at all.

676
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,340
I mean,

677
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,700
stargazing needs peace and quiet.

678
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
It can't be too noisy.

679
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,820
So,

680
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,660
two is best.

681
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
That's right.

682
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
You head back first.

683
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll take... I should take my leave.

684
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,700
Today, you have to tell me

685
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,020
what exactly is Five-Star Augury?

686
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,300
Her Ladyship said that star is the Ziwei Star.

687
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,220
It's also called the Taiyi
or something like that.

688
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,340
What does that mean?

689
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,500
The Ziwei Star?

690
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,260
Well, the Ziwei Star...

691
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,820
It's the brightest star in the sky.

692
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,460
It's also known as Taiyi.

693
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,420
This Five-Star Augury

694
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,180
is a treatise

695
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,740
that uses the movement

696
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,900
of the five planets
to divine fortune or misfortune.

697
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,020
For projects like canal construction

698
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,460
or flood control,

699
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,820
we depend on the planetary movements

700
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,420
to decide whether to proceed,

701
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,500
how to proceed,

702
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,340
and whether the timing is auspicious.

703
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,620
So...

704
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,740
(Prefect's Mansion)

705
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,860
My Lord?

706
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,860
My Lord?

707
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,420
Please, My Lord.

708
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,260
Actually, I asked you here today

709
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,820
to request something.

710
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,260
Prefect, rest assured.

711
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,180
Wei Dian's remnants have been cleared.

712
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,500
No one will trouble you again.

713
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Thank you, My Lord.

714
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,220
There...

715
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,540
There's one more thing.

716
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,580
Please, go on.

717
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,020
You know, earlier two generals
came to propose.

718
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,260
My daughter

719
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,500
has feelings for one of them.

720
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,020
Wei Qu is a brave and skilled warrior

721
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,500
in my service.

722
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,180
He's also quite handsome.

723
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,220
- He...
- My Lord,

724
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,500
it's not General Wei Qu.

725
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,860
It's…

726
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,740
General Wei Liang.

727
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,020
Wei…

728
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,060
Liang?

729
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,820
Yes, the mighty General Wei Liang.

730
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,780
I know of he is

731
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,340
your trusted right hand.

732
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,060
My daughter is not worthy.

733
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,460
We dare not dream of such an honor.

734
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,700
But...

735
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,340
But my daughter

736
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,140
has been crying everyday,

737
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,780
saying

738
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,860
she'll marry no one
but the mighty General Wei Liang.

739
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,500
My Lord, I beg of you.

740
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,460
This is a father's humble plea.

741
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,140
As for this matter,

742
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,500
I shall speak with

743
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,700
the mighty General Wei Liang.

744
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,460
Just asking him would mean the world.

745
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you, My Lord.

746
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,140
No, no, no.

747
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,860
- My Lord.
- I should thank you instead.

748
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,580
My Lord, please.

749
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,500
- My Lord, please.
- Please.

750
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,340
I'll down it.

751
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,020
Wei Liang, my boy.

752
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,500
Stop calling me your boy.

753
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,620
Call me bro.

754
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,460
I missed again.

755
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,820
You've got no manners.

756
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,740
Bro!

757
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,100
Look at him.

758
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,540
You hit me dead center.

759
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,620
Stop throwing at me.

760
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,860
I'm cutting patterns here.

761
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,860
No need to ask Wei Liang.

762
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,060
He won't agree.

763
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,820
How do you know?

764
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,020
You're the only one who doesn't know.

765
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,020
Why are you so sure

766
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,220
he won't agree?

767
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,020
If you don't believe me,

768
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,900
go ask him yourself.

769
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,300
Fine, I will.

770
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,860
Sounds like

771
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,180
we're not on the same page.

772
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,180
Let's make a bet.

773
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,460
Okay.

774
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
What's the wager?

775
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
If you lose,

776
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,100
you'll come with me

777
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,580
to pick out the prize yourself.

778
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
Deal.

779
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,340
Wei Liang.

780
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,410
- My Lord.
- Come here.

781
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,420
I've got good news for you.

782
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,380
I met the prefect today.

783
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,060
He wants to marry his daughter to you.

784
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,180
What?

785
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,620
- Isn't it good news?
- I...

786
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,300
I...

787
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,500
She...

788
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,340
Are you happy?

789
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,940
My Lady.

790
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,740
You're back.

791
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,820
No, no way. It's impossible.

792
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
Why not?

793
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,060
We're just not a good match.

794
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,140
Wait, come here.

795
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,500
Why aren't you a good match?

796
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,020
What are His Lordship
and Wei Liang whispering?

797
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,340
They seem quite furtive.

798
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,460
Look.

799
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,780
My Lord,

800
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,340
I know you're doing this for me.

801
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,510
- Yes, I am.
- But...

802
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,940
I'm talking to you here!

803
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,460
She's the prefect's daughter.

804
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,620
Why are you turning her down?

805
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,500
I've already given my heart to someone.

806
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,940
I can't love anyone else.

807
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,580
You have? Who's she?

808
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,420
I...

809
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,180
Remember when we took Wei Liang

810
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,980
to the prefect's for the proposal?

811
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,060
Yes.

812
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,220
Wasn't that just to

813
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,980
sow discord between Yuan Wang and Wei Dian?

814
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,100
But who would've thought...

815
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,860
What's wrong?

816
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
The prefect's daughter has fallen for him.

817
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
She begged His Lordship

818
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,380
to let her marry Wei Liang.

819
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,820
What?

820
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,180
But we...

821
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,620
Yes, I'm doing this for you.

822
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,500
The prefect's daughter is a noble lady.

823
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,020
Listen, I'm talking here.

824
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,180
You know what?

825
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,460
Love takes time to grow.

826
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,220
Him? Wei Liang?

827
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,980
Well,

828
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,660
that's great news.

829
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,740
Great news.

830
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,980
Great news indeed.

831
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
If that's the case,

832
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,860
should I go ask

833
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,780
His Lordship to finalize

834
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,900
the marriage right now,

835
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,620
even if Wei Liang doesn't agree?

836
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,220
Finalize it...

837
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,500
The marriage?

838
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,060
But my words don't count.

839
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,980
I'll go boil some water.

840
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,860
Move aside.

841
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,500
Heading for the city gate?

842
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,380
My Lord.

843
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,380
- Tao...
- Step back.

844
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,900
Wait.

845
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,940
We're not done here.

846
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
My Lord,

847
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,580
if you're doing this for my sake,

848
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,020
please don't make me marry her.

849
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
I'm begging you.

850
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,860
Wait.

851
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,940
At least tell me why.

852
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,860
You know nothing

853
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,020
about love.

854
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,420
It can't be forced.

855
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,060
How about letting one of them marry her?

856
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,300
Come back!

857
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,340
How did you know

858
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,300
he won't agree?

859
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,300
There's a lot you don't know, My Lord.

860
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,980
Fine.

861
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,820
You win.

862
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,620
So, my prize...

863
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,380
Alright.

864
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,020
Tao, let me help you.

865
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,220
I wouldn't dare.

866
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,540
Aren't you the prefect's son-in-law?

867
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,140
You're too important for this.

868
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,780
Don't talk nonsense.

869
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,700
So, you knew?

870
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
Of course I did.

871
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,620
That's great news.

872
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,780
The sooner I knew,

873
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,900
the happier I could be for you, General Wei.

874
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,620
How can you be happy for me?

875
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,180
Why not?

876
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,660
Look,

877
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,340
General Wei, right now,

878
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,820
you have great battle merits,

879
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,780
but you're still just a retainer.

880
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,100
Once you marry into Yuan Wang's family,

881
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,380
that's a whole different story.

882
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,480
From now on,

883
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,020
you'll have a beauty by your side

884
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,940
and enjoy a life of wealth and honor.

885
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
I'm happy for you.

886
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,100
You're not worried at all?

887
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,060
Why should I be?

888
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,580
Let me...

889
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,940
- Let me.
- No need.

890
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,780
Are you happy now?

891
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,540
You're about to get married.

892
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,780
Why are you still coming to me?

893
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,220
You only know half the story,

894
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,820
not the whole thing.

895
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,380
I've already told His Lordship

896
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,980
I'd never marry her.

897
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,620
If I'd known it'd come to this,

898
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,220
I wouldn't have gone to propose.

899
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,020
All these years,

900
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,180
the four of us have followed

901
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,700
His Lordship through thick and thin,

902
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,100
fighting battles everywhere.

903
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,780
Lost count how many times

904
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,460
we crawled out from piles of bodies.

905
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,500
By watching each other's backs,
we made it this far.

906
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,660
Why are you telling me this?

907
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Alright, alright.

908
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,300
I'll drop it.

909
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,820
The four of us use different weapons.

910
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
You know that, don't you?

911
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,420
I do.

912
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,820
So what?

913
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Ten years ago,

914
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,580
His Lordship had a craftsman

915
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,660
make each of us a miniature

916
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,920
golden version of our weapons.

917
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,620
Mine is a small gold dart.

918
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,500
Wei Qu's is

919
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,540
a pair of long and short swords.

920
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,380
Wei Xiao's,

921
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,180
a small gold bow.

922
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:49,700
Wei Duo's,

923
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,900
a small sword.

924
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,860
I'm not interested

925
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,060
in your man stuff.

926
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,460
To us four,

927
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,580
these miniature weapons

928
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,060
represent who we are.

929
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,660
Every time we go to the battle,

930
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,620
we leave them at home.

931
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,540
We weren't born on the same day,

932
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,460
and I guess

933
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,500
we won't die on the same day either.

934
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,060
But one day,

935
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,140
even if all four of us are gone,

936
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,060
burying these miniature weapons together

937
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,500
will mean we'll always be brothers.

938
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,940
So,

939
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,140
I want you to have this.

940
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,820
♪The moonlight is as silent
