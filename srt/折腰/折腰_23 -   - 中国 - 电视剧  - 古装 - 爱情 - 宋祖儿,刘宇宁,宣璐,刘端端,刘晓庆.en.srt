Yesterday,
it was you who brought me back?

56
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,740
Yes.

57
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,410
You were drunk yesterday.

58
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,490
Did I say anything
that might have upset you

59
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,410
when I was drunk?

60
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,770
No.

61
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,610
Who scratched you?

62
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,460
It wasn't me, was it?

63
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,460
You can't drink anymore.

64
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,660
I never scratched anyone
after drinking before.

65
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,410
Liang.

66
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,250
My Lord, what happened to your neck?

67
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,090
Are you alright?

68
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,130
A cat scratched it.

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,420
Hyah!

70
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,730
When did the Lord have a cat?

71
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,220
You're so silly.

72
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,060
- What happened?
- Hyah!

73
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,020
My Lady.

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,810
What's wrong?

75
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,220
Well,

76
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,100
back when we were in Rongjun,

77
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,170
Wei Liang gave me
a little gold dart, right?

78
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,900
- Did you lose it?
- No.

79
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,410
How could I have lost it?

80
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,980
Well,

81
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,220
I want to give him a gift in return.

82
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,580
It's something I promised him

83
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,370
when I asked why the Lord

84
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,290
was angry last time.

85
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,900
Go ahead. What are you hesitating for?

86
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,660
I want to give him

87
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,100
this.

88
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,370
A heart-guarding mirror.

89
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,540
It's good and practical.

90
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,410
But it's just a plain bronze mirror.

91
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,220
I want to give him something better,

92
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,250
but I don't know much about it.

93
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,250
My Lady, could you help me decide?

94
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,660
- Leave it to me.
- Thank you, My Lady.

95
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,930
My Lord.

96
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,890
Where is the Lady?

97
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,220
She went out to buy something

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,540
at the West Market.

99
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,220
She should be back soon.

100
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Okay. Got it.

101
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,450
Yes.

102
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,650
My Lady.

103
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,700
You're back so early today.

104
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,620
Yes.

105
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,460
What did you do today?

106
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,540
I just took a stroll on the street.

107
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,580
Have you had dinner?

108
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,420
Not yet.

109
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,170
Go prepare the food.

110
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,010
Yes.

111
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,050
I'll change my clothes.

112
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
Alright.

113
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Are you busy today?

114
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,130
Not really.

115
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,820
Even if you're working for me,

116
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,710
you must take care of your health.

117
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,460
You must be talking

118
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,060
about the Deer Hunt, right?

119
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,820
Don't worry.

120
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,180
I've basically prepared the invitations.

121
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,820
You don't need
to worry about it anymore.

122
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,340
But there's one thing

123
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,980
I'd like to report to you.

124
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,610
I haven't seen my cousin in a while,

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,490
so I'd like to invite them

126
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,890
to represent Yanzhou

127
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,010
for this event.

128
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,100
Sure, it's nothing serious.

129
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,570
Oh, right.

130
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,890
Don't invite anyone

131
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,980
from Bianzhou.

132
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,030
After all, the canal repairs
have nothing to do with them.

133
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,060
Moreover,

134
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,220
if we invite them,

135
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,140
it'd make things hard
for Grandmother and Yan.

136
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,580
I understand.

137
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,700
Don't you

138
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,700
have something to say to me?

139
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,140
Is there

140
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,220
something you haven't done?

141
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,850
I need to write the invitations.

142
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,340
Then I'll leave you to it.

143
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,490
I'll check if the food is ready.

144
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm starving.

145
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,130
I... Should I go?

146
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,300
No, I'll go.

147
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,090
My Lady.

148
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,340
Did you forget something?

149
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,660
Done.

150
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,370
Now, you no longer have to worry

151
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,850
about the candle going out at night.

152
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,660
Thank you.

153
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,180
Wait.

154
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,610
Don't you have

155
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,940
anything else to do?

156
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,970
No.

157
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,300
Then get some rest.

158
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,100
(Boya)

159
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,130
You can ignore your uncle,

160
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,460
but your father is
most worried about you.

161
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,180
Go back and let him know you're safe.

162
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,530
Well,

163
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,010
when will you return?

164
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,300
Fan and Bi Zhi

165
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,580
are going to Yujun for the Deer Hunt.

166
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,820
I'll go with them.

167
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,980
It's also a good chance to see

168
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,100
how your sister is doing.

169
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,610
Is the Deer Hunt an event

170
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,060
with the horse riding
and archery competition?

171
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,700
I've only heard of it

172
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,770
but never seen it.

173
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,180
It's not about fun.

174
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,820
We're going for serious matters.

175
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,280
It's inconvenient to bring you along.

176
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
Ci,

177
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,060
I've asked some escorts
to send you back.

178
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,490
You can rest assured and go.

179
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,610
Bi Zhi,

180
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,250
I still want something.

181
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,420
With it,

182
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,460
I won't have any regrets
on this trip back.

183
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,650
Go ahead.

184
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,770
I'll get it for you.

185
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
I want a horse
that can run a thousand li a day

186
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,340
that no one else can catch up with.

187
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,700
That's easy.

188
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,540
No problem.

189
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,490
Thank you.

190
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,730
The basic schedule
for the Deer Hunt has been set.

191
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
The first day,

192
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,250
combat trials.

193
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,460
The second day,

194
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,490
hunting and capture.

195
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,890
In the evening,
there will be a banquet for the guests

196
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,300
to discuss the canal repair project.

197
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,100
Although this event

199
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,700
is to show the strength of Wei,

200
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,100
we still need

201
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,220
to pay attention
to safety during the trials.

202
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,770
At this time,

203
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
the heart-guarding mirror
is very important.

204
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,370
At a critical moment,

205
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,520
it can really save your life.

206
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,060
Of course.

207
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,700
Speaking of this, I just remembered

208
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,010
that the Lady made me

209
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,320
a special heart-guarding mirror.

210
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,610
It's thicker than usual,

211
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,420
and it has scriptures carved around it

212
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,100
for protection.

213
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,300
My Lord,

214
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,650
is this the one you meant?

215
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,730
How did it end up with you?

216
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,940
Xiaotao gave it to me this morning.

217
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,490
Xiaotao must've given you the wrong one.

218
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,690
Take it.

219
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,010
I made a mistake.

220
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,370
The one I have is

221
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,420
inlaid with white jade

222
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,890
and trimmed with gold thread,

223
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,010
and there are

224
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,820
two mandarin ducks carved on it,

225
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,820
symbolizing deep affection.

226
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,700
The one from the Lady must be different.

227
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,650
It must be different.

228
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Leave me.

229
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,510
(General's Mansion)
Don't play around on the way.

230
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,500
Just go home.

231
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,370
Got it.

232
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,580
Please stay.

233
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,700
You should stay, Aunt.

234
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,020
Fan.

235
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,650
Be careful on the way.

236
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,060
Bye.

237
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,940
The list has been discussed
with Mr. Gongsun.

238
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,700
Is there anyone else you want to invite?

239
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,490
No.

240
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,570
You decide.

241
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,730
By the way,

242
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,700
last time you mentioned

243
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,060
inviting your cousin

244
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
and Bi Zhi over.

245
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,820
Yes.

246
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,530
Are they still on good terms?

247
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,420
Yes.

248
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,890
Bi Zhi

249
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,490
is also a martial artist,

250
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,770
so he probably often competes
with others.

251
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,300
Yes.

252
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,610
With blades and swords,

253
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,700
he must often get hurt, right?

254
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,850
Of course.

255
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,250
Does your cousin ever

256
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,890
make armor for him?

257
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,420
Or

258
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,300
something else?

259
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,860
Perhaps shoes and socks.

260
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,660
That won't be enough.

261
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,870
What about other things?

262
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,460
If you think there's anything

263
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,330
my cousin does wrong,

264
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,700
just tell me.

265
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,010
It's nothing.

266
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,290
What's wrong, My Lord?

267
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,940
Today, I had a match

268
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,090
with Wei Liang.

269
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,460
Both of us ended up injured,

270
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,490
but only I'm feeling pain

271
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,620
in my chest now.

272
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,730
Were you hurt?

273
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,660
Wei Liang's a moron.

274
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,460
How could he have hurt you?

275
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,770
It's fine.

276
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,090
With his skills,
he normally couldn't hurt me.

277
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,090
But...

278
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,290
But he was wearing
a heart-guarding mirror.

279
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,530
I wasn't.

280
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,420
How about this?

281
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,360
I'll instruct them

282
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,660
to make sure the meals these days

283
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,900
don't include spicy or trigger foods.

284
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,990
Are you really okay?

285
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,140
Should I call the physician?

286
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,050
No need.

287
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,570
Let's eat.

288
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,480
You can't drink the soup.

289
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,820
There's fish.

290
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,260
Alright.

291
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,740
Then...

292
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,220
Eat this.

293
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,320
You've been looking
at this mirror all day.

294
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,390
What's so special about it?

295
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,590
Don't touch it.

296
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,570
Slow down.

297
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,860
Since you got this mirror,

298
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,380
you haven't been walking properly.

299
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,290
It's a token
of Xiaotao's good intentions.

300
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,140
It's useless,

301
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,460
yet you're showing it off.

302
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
It's meant to protect you,

303
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,290
not for you to protect it.

304
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,460
What does the Lord mean by "humph"?

305
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,770
If you don't handle this well,

306
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,460
it won't just be a "humph".

307
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,420
If you're sent to a bitter, cold place,

308
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,460
you'll really need

309
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,660
this mirror.

310
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,740
You're all jealous of me.

311
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,090
- Come.
- What's wrong?

312
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,250
Why so sneaky?

313
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,380
I have a question.

314
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,690
Did the Lady give the Lord

315
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,290
a heart-guarding mirror?

316
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,890
The one inlaid with white jade

317
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,680
with gold thread
and a mandarin duck pattern?

318
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,570
What? There's no such thing.

319
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,720
There's no such a heart-guarding mirror

320
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,940
in the world.

321
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,980
Soon, there will be.

322
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,090
I've been to all the shops in Yujun.

323
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,620
The heart-guarding mirrors
are either bronze or brass.

324
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,620
No one has ever heard
of a jade-inlaid one,

325
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,090
let alone sell it.

326
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,620
The Lord is really making it hard
for us.

327
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,900
Since he said it,

328
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,250
I have to make it for him.

329
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,530
We've received a lot of gifts lately.

330
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,220
I remember there's a piece
of fine white jade

331
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,900
and some gold and silver.

332
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,290
You go get them.

333
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,220
- Sure.
- Yes.

334
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,330
General.

335
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,220
General, General.

336
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,980
My Lady.

337
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,520
Young Master Ci didn't want to return,

338
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,620
so he left his silver spear

339
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,180
and headed straight toward Yujun.

340
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,420
The general selected

341
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,770
the horse he rode,

342
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,220
so we couldn't catch up.

343
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,460
What did he say?

344
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,330
He said he'd wait for the Lady in Yujun.

345
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,570
Yulu,

346
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,980
go after him now.

347
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,820
Yes.

348
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,860
♪The graceful grass♪

349
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,010
♪Stands alone yet captivating♪

350
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,980
- Leave us.
- Yes.

351
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,840
♪Twists into the night♪

352
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,370
Ehuang,

353
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,220
your voice is damaged.

354
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,940
If you keep singing,

355
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,700
your voice...

356
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,490
It will never recover anyway.

357
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,770
However,

358
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,940
its current condition

359
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,050
actually makes it easier for me to act.

360
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,140
What do you mean by this?

361
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,380
The Lord of Wei is a man

362
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,010
who values loyalty and righteousness.

363
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,810
If my voice was ruined because of him,

364
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,490
he'd surely have to accept me

365
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
and allow me to participate
in the Deer Hunt.

366
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,530
But your voice

367
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,980
was ruined

368
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,460
from drinking medicine, right?

369
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,730
- What does it...?
- Is that so?

370
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,140
The Governor of Yanzhou
was searching for belles

371
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,420
for a political marriage.

372
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,620
He knew I had beauty
and talent in music,

373
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,940
so he tried to abduct me
and give me to the Lord of Wei.

374
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,700
It was because of this

375
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,810
that I poisoned myself to ruin my voice.

376
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,490
Yes.

377
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,420
You're right.

378
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,940
Go prepare

379
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,620
for the trip to Yujun.

380
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,220
Bogong,

381
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,090
you can blame me.

382
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,380
But I have no other choice now.

383
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,900
♪The graceful grass♪

384
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,730
♪Stands alone yet captivating♪

385
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,970
♪My longing for it♪

386
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,670
♪Twists into the night♪

387
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,300
(We'd like to invite you to the event)

388
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,250
My Lord, the invitations are ready.

389
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,490
We can send it out today.

390
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,220
Good, thank you.

391
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,790
I'll send someone to pick it up shortly.

392
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,330
I've prepared a gift for you.

393
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,700
I hope you'll like it.

394
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,330
I'll go back to work now.

395
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,330
My Lord.

396
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
My Lord.

397
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,900
Lady Yulou is at the post house

398
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,250
and wishes to meet with you.

399
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,700
Got it.

400
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,860
Would you like me to go with you?

401
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,140
I promised you
I'd take good care of her.

402
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,910
You've worked hard preparing
the invitations.

403
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,810
I'll go on my own.

404
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,860
(We'll have the Deer Hunt in Yujun.)

405
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,460
(We'd like to invite you to the event.)

406
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,140
(Virtuous Words)

407
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,540
How is it?

408
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,530
Sorry for my incompetence.

409
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,530
Lady Yulou's voice

410
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,490
might be beyond treatment.

411
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,790
You may leave.

412
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,650
Yes.

413
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,620
What happened

414
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,530
to your voice?

415
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,620
My Lord,

416
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,760
since my cousin-in-law passed away,

417
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,490
to capture my cousin,

418
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,810
Chen Pang spread the news
about her beauty

419
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,980
and talent in music,

420
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,980
which made many
of the powerful covet her.

421
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,380
To avoid being coveted by villains,

422
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
my cousin

423
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,820
poisoned herself to ruin her voice.

424
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,090
Lady Yulou, why go to such extremes?

425
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,700
Though I am only a woman,

426
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,330
I still have my integrity.

427
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,620
You may not know,

428
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,770
- that villain...
- Zixin.

429
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
Shut up.

430
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,420
Ehuang, let me say it.

431
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,810
The villain who forced my cousin
to ruin her voice

432
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,570
was the Governor of Yanzhou,

433
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,890
Qiao Yue.

434
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,260
Qiao Yue?

435
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,620
Qiao Yue has been

436
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,050
searching for women everywhere.

437
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,860
Once he heard of my cousin's name,

438
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,220
he relentlessly pursued her

439
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,910
and even attempted to abduct her.

440
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,770
He is still in mourning.

441
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,140
Why would he do this?

442
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,940
You may not know,

443
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,250
but Qiao Yue's search for women

444
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,940
was not for his own sake

445
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,730
but to offer them to the states

446
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,180
in an attempt to forge alliances.

447
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,350
This time, he wanted to abduct my cousin

448
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,980
and offer her to you

449
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,250
and solidify his niece's position

450
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,180
as the Lady of Wei.

451
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,290
He surely did not know

452
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,140
that we were old acquaintances,

453
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,860
so he sent his nephew to chase me,

454
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,530
trying to forcibly bring me

455
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,980
back to Kangjun.

456
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,730
You mean Qiao Ci?

457
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,530
He's young

458
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,940
but ruthless.

459
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,700
To catch me,

460
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,810
he used any means necessary.

461
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,460
Thankfully, Zixin protected me,

462
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,490
so we narrowly escaped.

463
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,300
However,

464
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,220
along the way,

465
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,530
even the jade Bogong left me

466
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,090
was lost.

467
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,290
I didn't want to come back to Yujun,

468
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,380
but now,

469
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,010
I really have no other choice.

470
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,010
How could this happen?

471
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,140
In my desperation,

472
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,140
I had no choice but to ruin my voice.

473
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,420
That beautiful singing voice

474
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,180
was useless

475
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,770
and only brought trouble.

476
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,050
It was better to destroy it.

477
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,220
I refuse to be a caged bird,

478
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,250
serving men with my beauty.

479
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,770
Zhonglin,

480
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,090
there's something I must ask you.

481
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,090
I don't care what Qiao Yue thinks,

482
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,330
but you...

483
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,940
What do you think?

484
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,330
Did you really have Qiao Yue

485
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,810
search the world for belles
to present to you?

486
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,530
I don't know anything about that.

487
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,180
Then I'm at ease.

488
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,220
It seems like the Qiao Clan
acted on their own.

489
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Lady Qiao wouldn't have known it.

490
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,140
You must not

491
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,180
blame her for this.

492
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,570
Lady Yulou, rest assured.

493
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,380
Lady Qiao

494
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,660
couldn't have known about this,

495
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,250
and I won't blame her.

496
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,730
It's very improper

497
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,090
for the Qiao Clan to do
such a disgraceful thing

498
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,050
relying on your favor toward Lady Qiao.

499
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,860
What they destroyed today

500
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,050
was the jade pendant Bogong left me.

501
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,750
Tomorrow,

502
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,570
they might destroy
your family's reputation

503
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,010
that's been built over generations.

504
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,050
Lady Yulou, rest assured.

505
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,290
You'll surely get an explanation
for this.

506
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,570
Please take care.

507
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,570
I'm leaving now.

508
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,090
Zixin.

509
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,850
Ehuang.

510
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,250
Get a new carriage and horses.

511
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,330
Rest assured.

512
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,380
What's most valuable about you

513
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,810
is your noble bearing.

514
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,530
You must never lose that no matter when.

515
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,060
Wei Liang.

516
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,020
My Lord.

517
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,140
The Governor of Yanzhou
has been collecting belles

518
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
to send to the states.

519
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,180
Do you know about this?

520
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,250
Previously,

521
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,490
I heard that there was
a belle in Yaozhou,

522
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,180
and they sent someone to check on her.

523
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,090
That's all.

524
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,290
My Lord,

525
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,380
why are you so angry?

526
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,500
My Lord,

527
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,460
I've brought back the invitations

528
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,860
from the Lady as you instructed.

529
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,330
Do you want to confirm it again?

530
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,850
Send them off.

531
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,890
Wait a moment.

532
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,690
The Qiao Clan
will not be invited for now.

533
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,330
Send the others off.

534
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,700
Yes.

535
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,260
(We'd like to invite you to the event.)

536
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,730
Why are you giving Lady Yulou a gift?

537
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,250
Since I've promised the Lord

538
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,460
to take good care of her,

539
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,050
I will do my utmost.

540
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,570
(Gift List)
I've looked at it.

541
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,630
(Flower table, dining table)
These items are good.

542
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,980
Add a stove.

543
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,530
She's been traveling for so long,

544
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,490
and she's fallen ill.

545
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,810
Hurry and send them over.

546
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,650
Yes.

547
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,940
My Lady.

548
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,090
My Lady.

549
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,420
Something's wrong.

550
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,860
You're too old to be so flustered.

551
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,330
Can't you speak calmly?

552
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,380
Duang said

553
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,220
that the Lord withheld
the invitation to Boya,

554
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,950
because Lady Yulou complained to him,

555
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,090
saying the governor wanted
to strengthen your position

556
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,860
and sent Young Master Ci to abduct her

557
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,140
to offer her to the Lord.

558
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,420
How could Uncle be so foolish?

559
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,490
The governor could do such a thing,

560
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,810
but why would Young Master Ci
be involved?

561
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,570
I don't know.

562
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,980
Duang said

563
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,120
that the Lord has confirmed.

564
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,560
Everyone knows that the governor
has been searching

565
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,490
for belles everywhere.

566
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,040
He even claimed that Yanzhou and Wei
are doing this together.

567
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,810
Now, the Lord is angry.

568
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,010
My Lady,

569
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,220
should you ask for mercy
on behalf of Yanzhou?

570
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,370
The Deer Hunt is such a big event.

571
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,070
If there's no representative
from Yanzhou,

572
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,810
it will be humiliating.

573
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Don't panic for now.

574
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,330
This is half true and half false,

575
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,050
and we can't explain it all at once.

576
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
Besides, he's angry right now,

577
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,140
so we can't ask him head-on.

578
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,290
What is this?

579
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,280
This is the jade pendant
that my brother gave to Lady Yulou,

580
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,460
but it was broken

581
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,090
when she escaped to Yujun.

582
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,290
I'm really sorry

583
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,220
for what my uncle did.

584
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,980
You don't need to doubt me.

585
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,090
I feel the same as you

586
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,900
on this.

587
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,490
You're not even pleading
for your family?

588
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,140
My uncle has always been foolish.

589
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,770
I'll write a letter home

590
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,620
and ask him what he's thinking.

591
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,010
Then I'll explain to you.

592
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,420
I have a question.

593
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,810
If one day,

594
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,860
the two families have a dispute,

595
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,460
will you stand by my side?

596
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,730
Right now,

597
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,330
I am standing by your side, right?

598
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,980
Though this was not caused by me,

599
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,140
I'm still related to it.

600
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,460
Tomorrow,
I'll ask Lady Yulou for forgiveness,

601
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,620
and I'll help her fix this jade pendant.

602
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,010
There's no need.

603
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,570
I don't blame you.

604
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,330
I'm just a little disappointed.

605
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,820
Your uncle

606
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,900
is doing evil outside under the banner

607
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,130
of the Qiao-Wei alliance.

608
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,380
I must give the world an explanation.

609
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,210
And

610
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,010
we can't go as you wish

611
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,330
and invite your cousin
to the Deer Hunt now.

612
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,530
You're put in a tough spot.

613
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,460
I can understand.

614
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,980
Can't you just be

615
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,940
my wife?

616
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,860
(Chijun, Liangya)

617
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,340
(Mansion of the Lord of Liangya,
Liangya)

618
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,260
I've already told you.

619
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,170
The Lady

620
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,610
is being favored now,

621
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,900
so we can't confront her head-on.

622
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,300
You always say
we should keep a low profile,

623
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,730
but I'm afraid
that might cause future trouble.

624
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,340
She whispers in Father's ear every day,

625
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,740
wanting her son Liu Qi
to become the heir.

626
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,170
Do you think
practicing martial arts here

627
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,860
will solve everything?

628
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,260
You need to spend more time
pleasing the Lord.

629
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,010
As long as you win his favor,

630
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,820
she can provoke all she wants,

631
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,130
but it won't matter.

632
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Remember:

633
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,260
At the end of the day,

634
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,820
you are the rightful heir.

635
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,210
Got it?

636
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,980
I heard

637
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,650
that Wei is about to hold the Deer Hunt.

638
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,940
The invitation

639
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,980
has been delivered to the Lord.

640
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,570
I believe that if you seize this chance

641
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,170
and make a name for yourself,

642
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,980
your position as the heir

643
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,380
will be secure.

644
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,610
If I go to Wei,

645
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,530
I'm afraid she'll have her way
by father's side.

646
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,860
You have

647
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,530
always been

648
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,010
so indecisive.

649
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,090
I must remind you.

650
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,860
Your position right now

651
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
is precarious.

652
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,490
Young Master,

653
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,130
the Lord has sent someone

654
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:27,970
to call for you.

655
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,580
Father.

656
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,620
My Lady.

657
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,650
The reason I called you here today

658
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,170
is regarding the Deer Hunt.

659
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,380
I've decided to take Qi to Yujun.

660
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,650
Qi is not yet eight years old.

661
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,860
I'm afraid

662
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,820
people will laugh at us

663
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,330
for having a child represent us.

664
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,130
Father, please reconsider.

665
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,300
The invitation says

666
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,260
they invite the Lord of Liangya
to attend.

667
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,420
With the Lord there,

668
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,650
who'd bully Qi for being young?

669
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,170
If there's anything to laugh about,

670
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,860
you lost your engagement

671
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,050
and Panyi to the Lord of Wei

672
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,090
and even offended him.

673
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,980
If it weren't
for your repeated mistakes,

674
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,090
why would your father
have to travel at his age

675
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,480
to reconcile with the Lord of Wei?

676
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,420
Why do you insist on going to Yujun

677
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,380
and bring disgrace upon yourself?

678
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,380
I was discussing state affairs
with Father.

679
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,460
How could you, a woman, interrupt?

680
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,860
My Lord...

681
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,760
How impudent!

682
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,530
How dare you defy your mother?

683
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,820
My mother passed away long ago.

684
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,210
My Lord,

685
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,820
Maoqing has never accepted me
as his stepmother

686
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,530
and has insulted me repeatedly.

687
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,610
You wicked woman, shut up.

688
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,010
If you defy us again,

689
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll deprive you of your position.

690
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,490
Leave at once!

691
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,980
Father,

692
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,610
you forced me into this.

693
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,690
Guards!

694
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,690
Guards!

695
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,340
Please spare me!

696
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,090
Why?

697
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,050
Why must you commit parricide?

698
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,090
You always think I'm indecisive, right?

699
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,850
What's wrong?

700
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,690
Now, I've become the Lord of Liangya.

701
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,900
Aren't you happy about it?

702
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,260
You are the legitimate heir.

703
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,050
Why do you have to bear
the reputation of being unfilial?

704
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,690
Why didn't you consult with me first?

705
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,130
Since you like consultation so much,

706
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,050
when you and I have disagreements
in the future,

707
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,530
you can ask my late father.

708
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,860
My uncle is dead now.

709
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,860
The Liu Shan now

710
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,530
is the servant of the Lord of Liangya.

711
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,220
