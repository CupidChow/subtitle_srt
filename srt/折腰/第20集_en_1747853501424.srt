00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 2

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You don't have to go.

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going back to pack up now.

8
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Leave this dirty place.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ah Ci.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Master.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Enough, stop making trouble.

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I...

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The man said that

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the soil here is indeed a barrier.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And it's close to the Yonglin Qu.

17
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
At that time, the drinking water will be absorbed

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the energy will be low.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It can also be used for irrigation.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's indeed a place of living.

21
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wei Liang, Wei Xu, Wei Xiao.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You three

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
bring some wood and food.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wei Duo, come.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You go to the pond

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and arrange the repair of the water.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And get the book from Yang Hong.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Our journey will be delayed for a few days.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But when these refugees settle down,

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we can go back to the fishing village.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
OK.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The sword wound of the South Ferry has not fully healed.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
My injuries are not serious.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's just that I'm helping them drink water now.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's the most important thing.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I heard from you before.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There are many ways to do water repair.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For example,

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
like the weather, the weather, the rain, the rain, the cold, the cold,

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it will delay the construction of the house.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How did you plan to stop in Yanzhou?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
About the moon and the stars.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a pity that I don't know these.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you understand?

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I understand a little.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's great.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I plan to rebuild their home.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I'm afraid that the construction will be delayed

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and our journey will be delayed.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think this tree is very high.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a great opportunity.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know if your army

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
is willing to teach me how to be a star tonight.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm as leisurely as the South Ferry.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But the ones I know are really just a little bit lazy.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They are not good at archery.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How about this?

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's find a general to invite archery.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The three of us go together.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not convenient.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My people are out on business.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No one is going to invite Yang Feng.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The main thing is that I'm afraid.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't think it's accurate.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It will delay the South Ferry.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't have to be so slow to mislead me.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You still need this.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then I can only obey you.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ah Ci.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Aunt.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's so late.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You haven't rested yet.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm worried that you will leave the city at night.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I said that in the daytime

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
just for Uncle Xia Xia.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How can I walk around

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and make you worry?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm worried about you.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you worried about?

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you follow the official road

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
with a document

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
someone will escort you to the Boya.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's not that worrying.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The view here is good.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's clear.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Because Yang Feng is not here.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There are no stars tonight.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You changed your hairpin today.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's broken.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You found it?

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yesterday I thought you were being taken away.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When I found you

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I hit you from top to bottom.

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yesterday's hairpin had orchids on it.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Not today.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can look at the back.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just turned it over.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I looked for you yesterday.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All my thoughts are on you.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a good thing that you didn't find me.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Xie Nan really takes me in his heart.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Actually

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
yesterday I thought you were being taken away.

111
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm a little scared.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm afraid

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you're like a grandfather, father, and brother.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And you suddenly left me.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're actually very good.

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I've never

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
sacrificed a woman like that.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I want to be a woman

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was thinking

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll marry you.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But in the future,

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have more thoughts about you.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm afraid I'm in the middle of it.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I can't get through it.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I was like that too.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to marry you.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't have so many thoughts about you.

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I dream of the South Army's heart.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm willing to take a vow

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to let go of the grudge between the Qiao and Wei families.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now I'm willing to accept the refugees.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Good.

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In the future,

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't go out and wander anymore.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can finally rest in peace.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
These two days

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
seeing these refugees suffer

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm not only grateful

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
for the two states to have a lot of money.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But also for the people.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I have a wish.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I hope the arm tribe

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
can connect through a life line

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and stop the war.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I don't know

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
if this wish can come true.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The country has been fighting for a long time.

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you want to be a great man,

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you have to fight for the people.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If Yanzhou is willing to accept these refugees,

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
how can they come to us?

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm afraid that one day

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
we will also stand on the opposite side.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm afraid that the peace in front of us

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
can't last long.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Even if it's just a moment of peace,

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
as long as we work hard,

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
we can continue to be comfortable.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm afraid that

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the peace in front of us

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
can't last long.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm afraid that

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the peace in front of us

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
can't last long.

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm afraid that

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the peace in front of us

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
can't last long.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I, Fan Xiaoheng,

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
will follow the South Lord with a heart of justice.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No matter the peace

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
or chaos in the future,

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I will be loyal

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and never leave.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will never give up.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I will face difficulties,

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
go through difficulties,

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and overcome difficulties.

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I will fight for the peace

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and eliminate the hatred.

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why didn't you watch A'ci

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and let her go?

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The child is old.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She went with her sister-in-law.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How could I watch her?

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This child is strong-minded

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and unruly.

187
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't think

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
she can be a good daughter-in-law.

189
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
she is a good daughter-in-law.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
she is a good daughter-in-law.

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
she is a good daughter-in-law.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
she is a good daughter-in-law.

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You don't have a father.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If your father is still here

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and opposes you

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to cheat the beauty of the world,

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
will you listen to him?

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If your father can't control you,

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
how can you control A'ci?

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How much did she take with her?

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Young Master brought a lot of soft materials.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I bought her some.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did she bring any weapons?

208
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I brought a silver gun

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and a short sword.

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Did anyone escort her?

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

212
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I followed her with a personal guard.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Where did she go?

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She took the personal guard's document

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to Boya.

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The document?

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She didn't run away from home.

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She went out to have fun.

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The wind is strong here.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Be careful not to catch a cold.

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mother.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
A'ci.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is our residence.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Rein.

258
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,960
You have suffered

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
these days,

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
if you really

261
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,520
enjoy

262
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,380
writing affecting them,

263
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,000
then just say it.

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Why did you

265
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,000
leave without saying anything

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and ended up

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Mother,

268
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,160
you treat me so well.

269
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,000
You really don't cry.

270
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,760
You don't have to hide it from me.

271
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,760
I don't blame her.

272
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,160
I just feel sorry for you.

273
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,200
If it were before,

274
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,600
how would you live

275
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,280
in such an environment?

276
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
You didn't take away

277
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,680
the empty red envelope at home.

278
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Luckily, you found a good one.

279
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,280
Otherwise, how would you have not received it?

280
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,800
This zither

281
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
was made by the brush-painter

282
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
to find someone to make it for me.

283
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
It was because of this zither

284
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,520
that we accidentally got this Bo Ya.

285
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
Jingzhen had this?

286
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,120
I heard it in Kang County before.

287
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,600
Bo Ya, the commander-in-chief of the army,

288
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
had a general

289
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,560
who had offended Xue Tai.

290
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
I even pretended to be a spy.

291
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,400
He didn't let you down.

292
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,280
Xia'er,

293
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
did you feed the rat meat

294
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,160
in the house?

295
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,960
You did?

296
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,960
Why did you raise the rat meat?

297
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,120
Before, I saw Liu Yan

298
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,840
giving the rat meat to Manman.

299
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
He came to me on purpose.

300
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,800
He was so happy for me

301
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,880
that he hit ten rats with one breath.

302
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,280
Liu Yan is a playboy.

303
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,920
It would be more interesting if he were a pen-painter.

304
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,320
Our family doesn't lack that snake-lion beast.

305
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,800
What we lack

306
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,680
is the pen-painter

307
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
who hit more than ten rats.

308
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,320
You're right, Mother.

309
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,280
Fan,

310
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,320
you're doing well.

311
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm relieved too.

312
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
Mother, you finally came here.

313
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,000
You and Zi

314
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,840
should stay in Bo Ya and have a good time.

315
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,680
Grandmother.

316
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,000
Grandmother.

317
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
Zhong Lin and your sister are back.

318
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,320
Grandmother.

319
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,640
How is Rong Jin's business going?

320
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,520
It's going well.

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,800
And Yang Feng is helping

322
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,040
with the rehearsal.

323
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,720
There should be no more rest.

324
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
That's good.

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
You've been working hard

326
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,040
with him all the way.

327
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
It's not hard.

328
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm not tired.

329
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
I'm just a little tired.

330
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
I'm just a little tired.

331
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm just a little tired.

332
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm just a little tired.

333
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm just a little tired.

334
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
It's not hard.

335
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Sit down.

336
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Thank you, Grandmother.

337
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Watch the tea.

338
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Yes.

339
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Zhong Lin,

340
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,720
it's better to stay at home than to eat outside.

341
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
Come here tomorrow

342
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,520
and I'll prepare you some wine

343
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,800
to welcome you.

344
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,760
Okay.

345
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,080
Your wound is just right.

346
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,440
Can you drink now?

347
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
You're hurt?

348
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
It's just a small wound.

349
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
It's nothing serious.

350
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
I've been working out for the past two days.

351
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,640
I'm fine.

352
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,640
Grandmother,

353
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,720
we brought some specialties

354
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,240
from Rong Jun.

355
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,880
Xiao Tao and I will bring them to you.

356
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Okay.

357
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Zhong Lin,

358
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,120
your sister is very considerate to you.

359
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,080
Yes.

360
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,040
The female king's mind is very delicate.

361
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
You need to use your mind well.

362
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,400
Her mind

363
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,760
is on the people of Weiguo.

364
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,640
That's called loving the house and protecting the house.

365
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
I think your sister

366
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,640
really loves you.

367
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,040
What do you mean by that?

368
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,640
I just think she's a little clever.

369
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
So I just listen to her.

370
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,840
But I'm a duke.

371
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,400
How can I put my love and care

372
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
on her?

373
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,760
Yes.

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,360
Men should be considerate, right?

375
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Yes.

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Okay.

377
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Then you should

378
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,040
chat with your grandmother.

379
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Grandmother,

380
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
I just came back.

381
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
I need to go and say hello to my mother.

382
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I'll leave first.

383
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,040
You go ahead.

384
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Yes.

385
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Zhong Lin.

386
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
Zhong Lin.

387
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Grandma.

388
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Zhong Lin.

389
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Master.

390
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,240
The male king is here to see you.

391
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Zhong Lin, you're here.

392
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Mother.

393
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,240
Why are you here

394
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
to see me today?

395
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
I brought some fruits

396
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
from Rong Jun.

397
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
And some jewelry.

398
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,240
I'm here to see you.

399
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
If you're busy,

400
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
you don't have to come to see me.

401
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
I'm so happy

402
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,440
to see you.

403
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
Mother.

404
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Let's not talk about the past.

405
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,640
Okay.

406
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
Let's not talk about it.

407
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Sit down.

408
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,640
Try this fruit.

409
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,240
These jewelry

410
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,840
were picked by Qiao Shi.

411
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,240
This fruit is so good.

412
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Look at this fork.

413
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
How is it?

414
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Mother.

415
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,440
Why are you crying?

416
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Okay.

417
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,640
Don't be too sad.

418
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,840
You were wrong

419
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,440
about the pulse.

420
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
But I know

421
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,240
you can't let go of your father and brother-in-law.

422
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
It was my fault.

423
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,640
I was the one who was complaining

424
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
about your loss.

425
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
You neglected me.

426
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,840
But I also

427
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,040
neglected your feelings.

428
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,640
So you can only

429
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,040
talk about your feelings to others.

430
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Zhong Lin.

431
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,840
Mother doesn't want you

432
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,840
to be in between me and her.

433
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
So

434
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,440
this son-in-law

435
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,840
is not a good son-in-law.

436
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
I admit it.

437
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,440
It's not hard to admit it.

438
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,640
I'm just worried about you.

439
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Qiao is a good girl.

440
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm afraid you can't get over her.

441
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,640
You have to

442
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
live your life in comfort.

443
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
But

444
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
you must

445
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
think of her.

446
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
Don't be taken by her.

447
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
You can't control yourself.

448
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
No.

449
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm here to see you.

450
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
I'm not going to mention Qiao.

451
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Look at you.

452
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
You like her.

453
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Try the fruit.

454
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,040
Is it good?

455
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,640
I'll give it to my grandmother.

456
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
It's good.

457
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Try it.

458
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Is it good?

459
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,840
Mother.

460
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
It's too sour.

461
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
The fruits my son gave me are all sweet.

462
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Look.

463
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,240
You're back.

464
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
You asked me

465
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,640
to give you this sour fruit today.

466
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
It's the same as before.

467
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Is it sour?

468
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Try it.

469
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,640
I've been a spoiled child.

470
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
When I was a child,

471
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,040
I was wronged.

472
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,840
I cried in my aunt's arms

473
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,640
and told her what I wanted.

474
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,240
Nanjun is a tough guy.

475
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,240
I don't think he's ever been like my aunt.

476
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,640
My aunt is a stubborn person.

477
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,640
But she always has a soft side.

478
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,240
She can only be soft

479
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
when she's with someone else.

480
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
I'm grateful

481
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
that you're so considerate.

482
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,040
But Nanjun told my grandmother

483
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
that I was a little careless.

484
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,840
I'm grateful to you.

485
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,440
I have no complaints.

486
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
I know.

487
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Nanjun always speaks the opposite.

488
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,040
You've been tired all the way.

489
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
You didn't get any sleep today.

490
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,840
I'll send someone to get you a bucket of fish soup

491
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
to relieve your fatigue.

492
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Okay.

493
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Mo Fei,

494
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,440
you can't control yourself anymore.

495
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Look at you.

496
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,440
You're obviously in love with him.

497
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,640
When the dream wakes up,

498
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,040
tears fall in my eyes.

499
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,440
Who will go with the wind

500
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
and where will it fall?

501
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,240
I can't go back to the way I was,

502
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,640
so I have to separate.

503
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,840
No matter how happy the world is,

504
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,640
the scenery in the night

505
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,040
is like a dream to me.

506
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Memories are like a play,

507
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,240
so many songs are like a song.

508
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
The night breeze is swaying, the candle light is dimming.

509
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,440
The time is passing by,

510
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,040
but I don't care about the daybreak.

511
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,040
I can't go back to the way I was,

512
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,840
so I have to separate.

513
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,440
The white rain falls on my palm.

514
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Love is like snow melting in the wind.

515
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Grandfather.

516
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Father.

517
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Elder brother.

518
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,440
You're monsters.

519
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,640
You're like stones.

520
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Elder brother.

521
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,440
I want to let go of the hatred

522
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
and get along with her.

523
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,840
Can I really do that?

524
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
Can I really do that?

525
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
This time, I traveled around

526
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,440
and got a new city named Yongning.

527
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,840
Although the people of Yongning are not from the Uyghurs,

528
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,640
since we have taken them in,

529
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,040
we have to treat them like our own people.

530
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,040
Do you understand?

531
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Yes.

532
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,440
Now, because there are thousands of people suffering from war,

533
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,240
we only see the corners of the iceberg.

534
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
So,

535
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,040
I have a wish

536
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
that everyone can help me to fulfill.

537
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,840
I want to start from the plague

538
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,440
and go to all states, counties, counties, and counties.

539
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,440
To build a waterway.

540
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
So that the people of the world

541
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,040
don't have to fight for the water source.

542
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,040
The people can live in peace.

543
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
You're wise.

544
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,640
This will surely benefit the people of the world.

545
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,640
You can see the people's hearts.

546
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,840
But the water source is just a trick.

547
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,640
The history of various battles has been around for a long time.

548
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,440
It's not easy to pacify the ice and fire.

549
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,640
This is your idea.

550
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
To pacify the world is a good idea.

551
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,840
This is a good idea to imitate the alliance between the two states.

552
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,640
We can avoid the plague in a good way.

553
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,640
But the forces of each state may not agree.

554
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,040
So I discussed with the Uyghurs

555
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
to hold a land-raising conference.

556
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,840
At that time, all the people will come

557
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,440
to discuss the plan of the water source.

558
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,640
Then we will use the interests of the two states

559
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,240
to persuade all parties to cooperate.

560
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Although this is not urgent,

561
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,640
we have to prepare in advance.

562
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,840
So I'll trouble you to draw up an invitation list

563
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,240
and hand it over to the female army.

564
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,440
Yes.

565
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Female army?

566
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
The female army just went to the army of Rong.

567
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,240
Then they intervened in the government.

568
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
They are all family members.

569
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,840
There is no interference.

570
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Why don't you accompany me to the Luzhong room?

571
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,440
I have to drink at home.

572
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
How can a military lord go to drink with flowers

573
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,440
when he just returned to the country?

574
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,240
Then how many days will the military lord

575
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,240
drink with me?

576
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,240
Not even a few days.

577
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Zhong Lin, are you afraid of your sister?

578
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I'm afraid of her?

579
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Are you kidding?

580
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
What's the matter?

581
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
I envy her.

582
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
I don't have anyone by my side

583
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,040
who knows cold and hot.

584
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,640
If you can really settle down,

585
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
the best marriage

586
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,440
is not for you.

587
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,640
It's not easy to get

588
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,040
a good marriage.

589
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,240
There are two people

590
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,840
who are like a couple.

591
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,640
There are also people who are like a couple.

592
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
Since you know it so well,

593
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,040
I'll ask you a question.

594
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Can I

595
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,240
fall in love with Qiao's family?

596
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
No.

597
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,640
The Qiao family killed my family.

598
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,640
We have been through the pain of separation since childhood.

599
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,840
I know it.

600
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
But it's all the decision of her grandfather.

601
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,840
If you and I exchange with her,

602
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
it will be difficult.

603
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
But she used you

604
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,040
to take away the Bo Ya

605
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,840
and hold the rebellion.

606
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
It's true, right?

607
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
At that time, we two were fighting.

608
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
Of course, we would have a chance.

609
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Now look at her.

610
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
She helped me repair the Yongming District

611
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,840
and gave me the Yangfeng Bridge.

612
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
It means she has no selfish motive for me.

613
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
But the Qiao family?

614
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,440
Everyone knows

615
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,040
that cold and cold

616
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,840
are the same.

617
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,040
You have to separate yourself

618
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,440
to get three thousand pieces of cold.

619
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,240
You are wrong.

620
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,040
She is warm-hearted and sincere.

621
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
It's not like what you said.

622
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,240
Calm down.

623
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,840
I think you can't leave her.

624
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,040
Why do you ask me?

625
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
You

626
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,240
have fallen in love

627
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
but you are still filial.

628
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,240
In this way,

629
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,040
you will only be sad.

630
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,240
Look.

631
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
It's peaceful now.

632
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,040
You are not as sincere as her.

633
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
Your Highness,

634
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
I made you some soup to sober you up.

635
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
Drunk people don't drink.

636
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
They fall in love.

637
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Lan Yun,

638
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
come here.

639
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,840
What are you going to do?

640
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,840
Have you heard the story of Goddess Yushen?

641
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,840
I have never heard of it.

642
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,840
With a sleepy scholar in the forest,

643
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
she went to an open place.

644
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,040
She met a goddess for the first time.

645
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,040
She was fair and fair.

646
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,040
She was beautiful and beautiful.

647
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,840
A flower was in the garden.

648
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,240
A grass was in the garden.

649
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,040
The moon and the moon were in the garden.

650
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
The moon and the moon were in the garden.

651
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,040
The scholar was in love with the girl.

652
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,840
She ran forward and seduced the girl.

653
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,240
She was so happy.

654
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,440
When you are in love,

655
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
you are afraid of being too much.

656
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,040
You are too selfish.

657
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
You are not considerate,

658
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
not easy,

659
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,840
not simple,

660
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,840
not happy.

661
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
You are too selfish.

662
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,640
You are not considerate,

663
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,040
not simple,

664
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,640
not simple,

665
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,640
not simple,

666
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,640
not simple,

667
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
not simple,

668
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,840
not simple,

669
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,840
not simple,

670
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,840
not simple,

671
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
not simple,

672
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,840
not simple,

673
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,840
not simple,

674
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,840
not simple,

675
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,840
not simple,

676
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,840
not simple,

677
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,840
not simple,

678
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
not simple.

679
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,240
Why don't you draw anymore?

680
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,240
The fairy picture of Yushan is missing one face.

681
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
It's not complete.

682
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
I have no fairy in my heart.

683
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,440
How can I know what the fairy is?

684
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,760
And it will just hurt you.

685
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,200
Sorry, sorry.

686
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,320
It's okay.

687
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,040
I'll help you.

688
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,160
It's okay, it's okay.

689
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm back.

690
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,840
You're back.

691
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Why is your face so red?

692
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,320
Nothing. I just drank some wine.

693
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,920
Then warm your hands with this.

694
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,120
Yashu is busy these days.

695
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,960
I have to stay in Yashu for a while.

696
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Tell someone to help me pack up.

697
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,640
But Yashu is cold.

698
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,360
Do you have to go?

699
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,680
I'll help you get changed.

700
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,320
How long do you leave this time?

701
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,240
I'll stay for about three days.

702
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,160
OK.

703
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll send someone there.

704
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,800
OK.

705
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,880
It's alright now.

706
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,760
Forget about her.

707
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,960
She is not wherein.

708
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
I'm sorry. I drank too much today.

709
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm a little drunk now.

710
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Do you want me to

711
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,760
boil some hot water for Nan Jun?

712
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,280
No need.

713
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,120
I'll go to sleep in the summer house today.

714
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,120
Go to bed early.

715
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,640
Master.

716
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,760
Master.

717
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,040
It's already late.

718
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Why don't you

719
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,800
go back home

720
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,720
and live your life

721
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,920
in a pious manner

722
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
before you

723
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,000
change us?

724
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
You look

725
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,440
like

726
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,040
I called you here because I have something to do.

727
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,160
Yes, yes, yes.

728
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,960
Master, if you have something to ask, just ask.

729
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,280
I want to say that this Yanzhou...

730
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,480
Peaceful.

731
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,800
No, Yanzhou...

732
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,000
Just died.

733
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,720
That girl is so beautiful...

734
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,360
... that you can't imagine.

735
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,160
Yes.

736
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,920
Don't think there are other women in your prove.

737
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,280
By the way I am more disdainful than you are...

738
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,000
For you to bath.

739
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,040
I...

740
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm going to serve in anspace in Yinzhen.

741
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Going to...

742
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Having I, I'm going to serve in a place like this.

743
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,720
No really, just serving in an Fruit 2018

744
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
So we have to prepare in advance, right?

745
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,640
Yes.

746
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,680
Yes.

747
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,880
This is an important thing.

748
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,720
It's very important.

749
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,000
Including the paper and the belt.

750
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,560
Don't let it go.

751
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,080
This

752
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,480
must be a matter of course.

753
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,800
Yes.

754
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,040
No.

755
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,440
Mr.

756
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,280
Yes.

757
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,080
I suddenly remembered

758
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,120
that I haven't been to the mansion for a long time

759
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,440
to visit my mother-in-law.

760
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,800
How about this?

761
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,400
I'll go and do a temporary class.

762
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,600
OK. It's settled.

763
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,240
Master, she...

764
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,240
Go.

765
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,200
Go.

766
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,760
Come.

767
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,760
Master, you work so hard.

768
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,440
You even rushed back to Yashu

769
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,680
for the Lu Li Conference.

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,360
Although this is an important matter,

771
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,560
it's not a matter of time.

772
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,360
The Lu Li Conference

773
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,320
will start next year.

774
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
Actually, I can't see the female king.

775
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,120
How about talking to the female king?

776
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,480
The female king is free.

777
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,320
Recently, he has invited a bunch of

778
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,240
wine-growing women to paint in the Lu Zhongfang.

779
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,040
Go.

780
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,520
My lady,

781
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,520
are these clothes enough for three days?

782
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,960
Enough. Put them in.

783
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,400
My lady,

784
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,360
I'll send these

785
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,840
back for Nan Jun.

786
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,520
OK.

787
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,880
He just came back for a few days

788
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,920
and he's going to live there again.

789
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
Why is Nan Jun so restless?

790
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,320
He wants to think about it.

791
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,040
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

792
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,440
I can't understand

793
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
what the female king is saying.

794
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,080
Nan Jun is always on the lookout

795
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,800
but the female king is still following him.

796
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,880
Even you can see that he's on the lookout.

797
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,840
Why should I be angry?

798
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,080
He wants to be with him.

799
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,680
I'll do what I should do.

800
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,280
What's wrong with Zhong Lin?

801
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,640
He went to Yashu to live.

802
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,480
He's poor and he's alone.

803
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,040
You're

804
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,960
thinking about the female king.

805
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,120
Now I know

806
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,640
what's wrong with Zhong Lin.

807
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,960
He's hiding from the world

808
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,440
which means he's starting to like him.

809
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
He can't escape from you.

810
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,080
People

811
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,240
should let go of themselves.

812
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,920
Look at Zhu Shi.

813
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,600
He's having a hard time.

814
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,960
Great Madam, the female king wants to see you.

815
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
Let him in.

816
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,360
Yes.

817
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,840
Nan Jun has been busy with work recently.

818
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,560
I don't want to be idle.

819
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,280
Do you have anything else

820
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,440
to do?

821
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,200
Yes.

822
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,760
Zhong Lin is holding a reclamation ceremony.

823
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,720
I want to change the church

824
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,240
into a reclamation platform.

825
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
Someone needs to decorate it.

826
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,560
Can you take the responsibility?

827
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,480
I'd like to try.

828
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,960
I'll arrange it for you.

829
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,360
Thank you, Great Madam.

830
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,760
But I have another idea.

831
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,680
Tell me.

832
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,800
The reclamation ceremony

833
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
is to invite all the heroes

834
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,840
to take part in the ceremony.

835
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,680
Before the ceremony,

836
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
we should

837
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,480
find people to be the father

838
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,560
and make things happen for them.

839
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,480
First, we can tell the world

840
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,880
what Nan Jun wants.

841
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,000
Second, we can let these heroes

842
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,120
share the fame.

843
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,440
Then they'll be able to gather together.

844
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Great.

845
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,160
Let's do it this way.

846
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,560
I'll do my best.

847
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,400
Great.

848
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,720
Go tell Zhong Lin

849
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,120
that I've already

850
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,080
handed over the reclamation platform to Qiao Shi.

851
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,800
I'll see how Zhong Lin can take it.

852
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,800
Who said I can't leave him?

853
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,760
I think Yashu

854
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,160
is much better than his family.

855
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,840
At least he's free.

856
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,280
Yue Guang senior is still in Betrayal.

857
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:43,160
How did I let it go,

858
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
The past is like the past

859
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
But I still have the obsession

860
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
The love is hard to get

861
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
How long can I wait

862
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I have been to the end of the world

863
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
But I still can't get it

864
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
The wind and fire are like the wind and fire

865
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
The moon and the moon are like the moon and fire

866
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
The moon and the moon are like the moon and fire

867
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
The moon and the moon are like the moon and fire

868
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
The moon and the moon are like the moon and fire

869
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
The moon and the moon are like the moon and fire

870
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,160
The wind and fire are finally disbanded

871
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,160
Like a eternal summer, tender and humble

872
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
A single glance of the red sky

873
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,160
How can I forget it in my next life

874
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,160
I am willing to cross the sea of clouds to reach your wind and moon

875
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Waiting for the white snow to fall into the first snow

876
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,160
The south of the Yangtze River is not in your eyes

877
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,160
The heart is sad and sad

878
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,160
I am willing to give you the smile of a fox

879
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,160
Even if the wind and snow are like the wind and snow

880
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,160
No matter how much I don't know, I just miss you for this life

881
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:04,160
I don't forget it in my next life

882
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,160
I am willing to cross the sea of clouds to reach your wind and moon

883
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Waiting for the white snow to fall into the first snow

884
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,160
The south of the Yangtze River is not in your eyes

885
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,160
The heart is sad and sad

886
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,160
I am willing to give you the smile of a fox

887
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Even if the wind and snow are like the wind and snow

888
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,160
No matter how much I don't know, I just miss you for this life

889
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,160
I don't forget it in my next life

890
