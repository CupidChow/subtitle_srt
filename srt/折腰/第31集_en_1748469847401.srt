1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Xiao Tao sent a message to me

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and asked me to go to Lian Chao.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She said that Ah Jie personally went to Bo Ya

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to invite her brother-in-law to be her husband.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I thought she was trying to seduce me.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah Jie and brother-in-law are really good.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Xiao Tao especially invited

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
her brother-in-law to be her husband.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Women are more affectionate and friendly.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She went to the battlefield

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to help the Lord.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Although Bo Ya's husband

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
came late,

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
there must be a reason for it.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What reason?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She is thinking about her Yanzhou.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You guys go with the army to rest.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll go to Yangshui Shangyou later

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to inspect it.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
See if there are any missing fish

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and continue to do it.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll go too.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll go too.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to see Xiao Tao in Kang Jun.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I didn't say I was going to see you.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm just going to inspect.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to see Xiao Tao in Kang Jun.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You guys go. I'm not going.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Brother-in-law and Ah Jie are all here.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why don't you go back to Kang Jun together?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go back to Kang Jun together?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The clothes are the door-to-door goods of my Yanzhou.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Only the Wei State can be a door-to-door goods.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Follow the road of the clothes to go back to Kang Jun.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then you can go to Kang Jun.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Ah Jie has been away from home for a year.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Father and uncle and aunt

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
miss her very much.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
May the state of Yanzhou be prosperous and peaceful.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
May the uncle and aunt live a long life.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
May the father's health be prosperous.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
May the child be well-trained.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
May the elder sister and brother-in-law live a long life.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I know that I didn't get along with you

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
when I was angry with Nan Jun.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's because Nan Jun wrote a wish.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I wrote a regret.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Nan Jun is close to support.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's easy to do.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But I can only bite my family.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm the only one who wrote that my family didn't like Nan Jun.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
The

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
brother-in-law and sister-in-law have been married for so long.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Haven't you seen my father and uncle and aunt?

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are not feeling well.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I happen to have added the prescription that I used to take care of my grandfather.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I happen to go home and get it.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Try it first.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No need. I'm fine.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Great Madam and the Madam must be very concerned about the master.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's better to go back to Yong Yu County earlier.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Forget it. I'm not going either.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going back to the capital.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can't go.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This time, soldiers have been thinking about going home early during the war.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the same as them.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A Si is right.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A Si is right.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How about this?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Tomorrow, you can take your sister and go home with her.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What about my brother-in-law?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm relieved to have you and the people from Bo Ya escort me.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But you have to promise me to take good care of your sister.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When she's done playing, you send her to the border of Weiguo.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I will personally welcome her.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have to go home as soon as possible.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
My family is waiting for me.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Go to bed early today.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's start tomorrow.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have your family to see.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have my family.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't forget.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, Master really wants to go home?

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you stupid?

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did you forget what Master said in the capital?

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You guys blocked me.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How would I know what you said?

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Master once made a vow in the capital.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He said that one day,

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
if you really resist,

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you will be killed by the bandits.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You will be killed by the bandits.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You will be killed by the bandits.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So, Master can't resist.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can't resist.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You can't resist.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Master can't resist.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to resist and see Xiao Tao.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Really.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How about this?

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll go beg Master.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll send you home.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's settled.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come back like this.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm leaving.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What are you doing?

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going to sleep.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You said you wanted to rest.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to sleep.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let me go.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The people know to thank us for their families.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Only the most loyal woman from Yan State came out.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We went to the capital for her.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now,

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
we're here to visit her.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's really disappointing.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who's disappointed?

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't talk nonsense.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Master,

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Master,

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm talking about Xiao Tao.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She's already in Kang's Village,

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but she didn't come to me.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you mad?

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Master,

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the front is Bo Ya.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're going in to visit her.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No need.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Since the female army came to support us

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
with the help of Bo Ya,

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sure the commander of the female army is also there.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Since the master is not here,

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we won't bother you.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Master,

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
at that time,

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
in this forest,

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I saw Bo Ya

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and the commander of the female army.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I saw her

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
go down with them.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She was beaten

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
by them

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
on the way.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Then, Mr. Tang brought her here.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
General.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
General.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you here?

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Master,

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
this is Bo Ya and the commander of the female army.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is General Bi Zhi.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
General,

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm the chief of the female army.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Chief.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Duke Wei.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You didn't bring soldiers

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to fight in the battle of Pai Yi.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Why did you go to fight in Pai Yi?

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't know how to fight in Pai Yi?

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Without the female army,

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
how can the female army turn the tide?

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's Duke Wei's wife, Qiao Nu.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If we can get her to come down,

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it must be a great achievement.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Guards,

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
prepare to cross the river

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and capture Qiao Nu.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wait.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why did you do this alone?

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can't just use my strength

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to fight against our 20,000 soldiers.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't.

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But I can swim.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
General,

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the river surface has fallen.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then we can cross the river

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and capture Qiao Nu.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you hesitating?

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Shut up.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Tang Ruo,

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
they built a dam on the upstream

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to block the water and water supply.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We just wait for the water to cross the river

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and then attack with water.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you know the consequences?

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well...

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let alone our 20,000 soldiers,

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
even if it's 50,000,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
we will be buried to death.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Even if we can't capture Qiao Nu,

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
His Highness ordered us

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to go to support her.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Are we going to resist?

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's not right to leave a man behind.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We killed the emperor with our own hands

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and used our own tricks

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to make you all surrender.

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Now you're here to support us.

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If we succeed,

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
it's not going to be a good deed.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But if we fail,

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
we will definitely make mistakes.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Aren't you afraid of being killed

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
by a vicious person like me?

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But my husband, Marquis Wei,

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to help the four sides,

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
he built the water and water supply

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and made Liu Yan, this villain,

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to take advantage of it.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're here with such a

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
despicable, ungrateful and unfilial person.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Even if you're killed by the water supply

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and killed here,

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
in history,

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you're just a four-character character

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
in the Heaven's Law.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I wonder if you,

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
dare to risk your lives

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to bet with me.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let Liu Qi,

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the third son of the Han Dynasty,

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
kill the third son of the Han Dynasty

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
for the sake of his father.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why do you do this?

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There's no room in the rear.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We're worried about the enemy's attack.

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We're not going forward.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Retreat!

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Retreat!

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
My Lord, are you okay?

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Chunniang is so worried.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't take any more risks.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The South Army has already

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
used the army of the Liangya Army.

254
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If Liu Yan is moving the reinforcements,

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm afraid he'll be a double-edged sword.

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But don't worry, South Army.

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll go to the North Sea to invite the reinforcements

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
to guard the rear for the South Army.

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I finally fulfilled my promise to him.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Has Xiao Mi been here?

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The female army has been here.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But she left a few days ago.

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If Marquis Wei is here to pick up the female army,

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
it's really unfortunate.

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
She should have gone back to the fish village directly.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Impossible.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The military intelligence reported that

268
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the female army was swimming in the Yangshui River.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If she went back to the fish village,

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the water lantern on the plate...

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The female army reported it.

272
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wish my husband good health.

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I wish him a safe return.

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
General.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
When the female army came to the Boya,

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
did you bring anyone?

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Fan said the female army was in a big battle.

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It can be seen that Marquis Wei has a deep relationship.

279
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How many people did you bring?

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hundreds.

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
How many?

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hundreds.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hundreds?

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's tens of thousands of people who ambushed Liu Yan.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The female army wants to ambush Liu Yan?

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then hundreds of people against tens of thousands...

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's like a female army.

288
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's a battle.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What's the difference between hundreds of people?

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's dangerous and hard to avoid.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But the courage of the female army is really admirable.

292
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This time, I came alone and came home alone.

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't know how the female army feels.

294
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Fu Xin.

295
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes.

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Take the rest back.

297
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The rest, follow me.

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Go.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Go.

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Go.

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Go.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Go.

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Go.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go.

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Go.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go.

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Go.

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Go.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Go.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Go.

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You said you went to the battlefield.

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You came to the battlefield to fight for the Marquis?

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Fan.

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Slow down.

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I heard that tens of thousands of people ambushed.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Did he get hurt?

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why is it so risky?

320
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't know.

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The female army should not be in the team.

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He should have returned to the army.

323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The Marquis's people have gone to chase.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fan.

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Are you okay?

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I really have something to hide from you.

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You said it would be slow.

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Will you really be angry with me?

329
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are sisters after all.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sisters.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why would the female army be angry with you?

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If he is really hurt because of this,

333
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what should I do?

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I also want to go back to the army.

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No problem.

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Am I too willful?

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Before, I didn't see the horse.

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Now I have to force you to go home with me.

340
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Fan.

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You worry too much.

342
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We will resist you tomorrow.

343
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Go.

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Even if the female army is worried about the safety of the Marquis,

346
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
there is no need to go to the battlefield in person to risk it.

347
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The battle started because of Yanzhou and Liancheng.

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The Marquis had not enough people and was divided into two.

349
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The Marquis had not enough people and was divided into two.

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The whole situation was more dangerous.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And the Marquis also had

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
more dangerous.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In this situation,

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I can only do my best to give the Marquis a chance.

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I will be honest with the Marquis.

356
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The Marquis treats me as one.

357
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't want to disappoint him.

358
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If I am the only one,

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I can risk my life for him like today.

360
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I still have my family

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and the people of Yanzhou.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The Marquis' hard work will be rewarded.

363
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The little man is settled?

364
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The little man is settled.

365
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The rain is getting heavier.

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know how to deal with it tonight.

367
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's raining less in the Marquis.

368
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I miss Yanzhou.

369
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The Marquis destroyed the rain.

370
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Stop talking.

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you think the Marquis doesn't miss the Marquis?

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The Marquis came back to you this time

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
because he wanted you to go back with him

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to see his family.

375
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The rain is too heavy.

376
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We need to hurry up.

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Otherwise, the water will rise

378
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and we can't get through.

379
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We can't go back.

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
We can't go back.

381
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's hard to go back.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I hope that the rain can't move.

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The end is in the north.

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The rain is too heavy.

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The past is scattered.

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's hurry up.

387
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If the bridge is blocked,

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
we can't go.

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I hope that the rain can't go back.

390
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The rain is getting heavier.

391
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know how to deal with it tonight.

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I miss Yanzhou.

393
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't know how to deal with it tonight.

394
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I hope that the rain can't move.

395
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The rain is too heavy.

396
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The past is scattered.

397
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's hurry up.

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I hope that the rain can't move.

399
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I hope that the rain can't move.

400
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I hope that the rain can't move.

401
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If he wants to go back,

402
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
we can go together.

403
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If he doesn't want to go back,

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I won't force him.

405
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The bridge is flooded.

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You can go back.

407
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I still can't feel it.

408
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The bridge is flooded.

409
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We can only stay here.

410
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We have found the war camp near the pass.

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We have found it.

412
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The female army should have crossed the river.

413
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's stay here for now.

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We can talk about it after we cross the river tomorrow.

415
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Manager.

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Manager, do you have a kitchen?

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yishan.

419
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Chu Gong.

420
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Jie Feng.

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Qiao Si.

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Where is the female army?

423
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The male army?

424
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The female army?

425
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

426
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I thought you crossed the bridge.

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No.

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It rained heavily these two days.

429
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The path is dangerous.

430
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When did you arrive?

431
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We just arrived.

432
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Amazing.

433
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The female army meets the male army.

434
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll be a 할.

435
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll be a scalar if I want to meet Waiter Tao.

436
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I did it.

437
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
Although I didn't find the original soldier,

438
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,440
I stopped all the people in Liuyuan Gate.

439
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,000
How can you decide it without permission?

440
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Even if you can't get the soldier,

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,680
you should tell the commander-in-chief.

442
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,800
You are a soldier in the military.

443
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,440
You should be punished.

444
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,160
Do you understand?

445
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,640
Are you hurt?

446
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,280
Yes.

447
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,280
It's my fault.

448
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,320
I violated the military order.

449
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,920
In this case,

450
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
if the Southern Army sees me,

451
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,960
they should give me

452
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,840
more than a hundred military medals.

453
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
Otherwise, they will forgive me, right?

454
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,440
Your Majesty,

455
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,520
why did you go to the battlefield

456
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,480
to fight against the enemy?

457
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,800
Aren't you afraid that

458
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,480
the Southern Army will be injured?

459
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,840
Your Majesty has been missing the Southern Army for days.

460
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,520
How can the Southern Army hurt his heart?

461
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,840
Master,

462
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
it's not easy to meet the female soldier.

463
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,600
Can't you say something nice?

464
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,160
Master, it's just that I can't say it.

465
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,200
Come on.

466
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,680
You can't sing the song you taught.

467
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,000
You came here,

468
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,600
didn't you memorize the lyrics well?

469
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,160
I asked you to say something nice.

470
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm sorry.

471
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,080
How long has my brother-in-law learned to sing?

472
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,080
Enough.

473
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,520
I didn't guess.

474
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,620
I can't sing.

475
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,400
When did he learn this?

476
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,400
I don't know.

477
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,980
You can't sing anymore.

478
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,280
Then,

479
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I just won't sing again.

480
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,080
omiclos Goodnight!

481
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,560
I will sing.

482
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Why are you breathless?

483
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,720
Look,

484
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
what the head master said.

485
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,680
Show me.

486
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,320
What's this?

487
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,680
Peng bothering me?

488
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
No.

489
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,640
What do I have to do?

490
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,760
Tell me.

491
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,480
Say it.

492
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,180
Both pictures

493
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,080
have a connection.

494
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
I have to find her,

495
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,940
right?

496
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Here I am.

497
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,200
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,680
Thank you, Mr. Nan.

499
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,040
Your stove is not hot enough.

500
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,120
Isn't it cold?

501
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,720
You're cold?

502
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm not cold.

503
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm worried about the cold at night.

504
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,640
You're sick.

505
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,480
Did you go to get me a quilt?

506
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,880
It's too thin.

507
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,800
It won't work.

508
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,160
There are two beds.

509
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,320
It's warm enough.

510
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,840
Two beds won't work.

511
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,000
My charcoal is very warm.

512
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,080
Xiao Zao went to get firewood.

513
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,240
If Nan Jun still feels cold,

514
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,160
he might as well ask the men

515
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,760
to get some firewood.

516
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,720
It's probably enough for the whole inn.

517
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:56,760
Go.

518
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,880
Am I cold?

519
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,840
You're awake.

520
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,040
I felt펩

521
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
for the past few days.

522
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,840
I had a bad life.

523
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,400
Always having your eyes open.

524
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,720
Sometimes

525
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,160
awake in a dream at midnight,

526
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,320
I found you were not with me.

527
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
I felt so CD.

528
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,400
Miss you.

529
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
Thank you for saving Yanzhou.

530
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Thank you for coming to Xuanwang.

531
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
I'm sorry

532
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,520
for everything.

533
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,480
Don't mention the past.

534
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I did something wrong today.

535
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,280
I was worried about the mess.

536
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,720
I wanted to ask you a question,

537
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
but you didn't know how to say it.

538
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,800
So you didn't say it.

539
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
I didn't mean to bully you.

540
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
You want to ask me?

541
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,240
I want to ask you

542
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,640
why you didn't return to the army

543
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,800
after you were killed.

544
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
You wanted to go to the battlefield alone

545
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
to stop the six-eyed reinforcements.

546
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,120
Aren't you afraid?

547
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Can you not be afraid?

548
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,720
But the person I love is still on the battlefield.

549
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,320
I promised him that I would fight for him.

550
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,720
Maybe it's you.

551
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
I love him.

552
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,120
I can do anything for him.

553
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
I'll be with him when he's alive.

554
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,920
I'll be with him when he's dead.

555
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,520
I'll be with him when he's alive.

556
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
I want him to think that I don't like him.

557
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I don't love him.

558
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I understand.

559
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
I understand.

560
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Actually...

561
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I'm afraid

562
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,440
my family

563
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,280
and the people of Yanzhou will be the

564
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,480
only ones who can stop him.

565
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,480
For me,

566
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,280
he's as important as them.

567
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I understand.

568
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
It's all my fault.

569
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Man Man.

570
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,040
I have something to tell you today.

571
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,920
I asked you to be honest with me.

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,920
But I ignored your difficulties.

573
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,320
When I returned from the war,

574
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
I knew you were in trouble

575
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,120
when you came to help me.

576
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,840
You did so much for Yanzhou,

577
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,480
Weiguo, Qiao's family and Wei's family.

578
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
I still don't understand you.

579
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,040
Even your sister is blaming you.

580
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,480
But in fact,

581
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,200
no one is better than you.

582
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,000
You and I are related.

583
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,680
No one can be better than you.

584
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,160
And

585
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,240
you're in a dilemma between the two tribes.

586
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,400
If anything happens,

587
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,320
you'll be the first one to get hurt.

588
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
I also wanted to let go of the hatred.

589
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,440
I even felt that I had given up enough.

590
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,440
But when you asked me

591
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,920
if I would give up revenge,

592
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,760
I suddenly realized

593
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,280
that I had never given you any promise.

594
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,920
But you've been living under such pressure.

595
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,880
I know you came to help me.

596
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,240
But I'm a little scared.

597
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,320
I'm afraid you'll regret it.

598
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,440
I'm afraid you'll think I'm not worth it.

599
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,440
So when I came back to chase you,

600
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,120
I asked myself over and over again.

601
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,160
If I...

602
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,360
If I

603
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,320
lost you,

604
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,360
even if I killed all my enemies,

605
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,960
even if I got the world,

606
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
but I didn't have you,

607
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
what's the point of living?

608
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
I'm just a jerk.

609
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
You've done so much for me.

610
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,920
But I never know how to contact you

611
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,280
and care for you.

612
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,680
I used to say

613
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,960
that as long as I make you angry,

614
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,160
you can hit me.

615
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,680
Now that I've made you angry,

616
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,720
you can hit me or scold me.

617
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,920
But you must not leave me.

618
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,520
And you must not doubt my feelings for you.

619
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
I'll be your friend.

620
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
I'll be your friend.

621
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I'll be your friend.

622
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
I won't be your friend

623
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,080
or your friend.

624
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,440
Hit me.

625
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,440
Isn't this

626
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,080
a good thing?

627
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,120
Man Man.

628
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,400
I want to

629
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,840
go to see the army with you.

630
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm curious about

631
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
where you grew up.

632
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm curious about your family

633
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,080
and your people.

634
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,680
And my grandmother told me

635
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,920
to let go of the hatred.

636
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
So I think

637
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,680
maybe only when I get to the army,

638
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,160
I can really let go of it.

639
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,520
You've really done a lot for me.

640
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,960
That's because you

641
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,240
didn't leave me

642
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,160
when you were in trouble.

643
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,880
So?

644
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,960
Not bad.

645
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,720
Zhaoyi.

646
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,560
How does it not hurt in this life?

647
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,460
Zhaoyi...

648
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,160
Not complete yet.

649
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,540
But still delicious.

650
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,540
The old days are like the old days

651
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,540
But I still miss you

652
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,540
We are the iron force

653
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
We will rest in the field

654
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
Yes

655
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Give us orders

656
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,540
We will rest in the field

657
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
We will rest in the field

658
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Rest in the field

659
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Rest in the field

660
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Your Highness, have some water

661
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,540
Your Highness

662
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,540
I sent 100,000 soldiers to fight

663
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,540
The king killed 56,938 people

664
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,540
The wounded killed 4,276 people

665
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,540
The escaped soldiers killed 18,052 people

666
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,540
The escaped soldiers killed 36,934 people

667
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Among them, there were only three generals

668
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:49,540
The vice-general, Wu Ming, and almost ten soldiers

669
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
I beg Your Highness to rebuild the flag and fight again

670
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,540
To avenge the dead

671
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Your Highness, please don't

672
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Your Highness

673
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,540
The Japanese army still lost in the advantage of the army

674
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,540
If we keep fighting like this

675
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,540
I'm afraid Liangya will be defeated

676
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,540
The trick is to lure the traitors to escape

677
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
If not

678
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,540
The Qi of Liangya may have been on the city of Pan Yi

679
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
If you run slower

680
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Maybe the Qi of Wei has been on your body

681
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
Shut up

682
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Your Highness

683
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
I am sorry

684
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,540
I have been afraid of you

685
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I am not satisfied

686
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Now it's a defeat

687
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Uncle is so worried

688
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Liangya is afraid of a big mess

689
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Who doesn't agree to kill it

690
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
You have to kill it

691
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
I'm afraid you will have to kill it

692
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
I'm afraid you will have to kill it

693
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,540
You have to kill it

694
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,540
Just kill it

695
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,540
You can't come at this time

696
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
I think

697
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Facing the loyal subjects

698
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Still should be comforted

699
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,540
After returning

700
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,540
I am willing to help Your Highness

701
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Pull the comfort of the loyal subjects

702
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Why do you have to show your kindness to me?

703
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Just need Your Highness to order

704
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I will eradicate it

705
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Liu Xiao

706
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,540
Yes

707
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,540
Pan Yi's battle is delayed

708
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,540
General Lin led 20,000 soldiers to escape

709
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I order you to catch them back

710
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,540
If there is resistance, kill them

711
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
Yes

712
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,540
The rest of the soldiers will go back to Liangya to recuperate

713
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,540
For the time being

714
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Your Highness

715
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
This

716
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Does it make sense?

717
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Yes

718
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
Yes

719
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Your Highness is wise

720
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,540
When I return to Chi Jun

721
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,540
I will definitely help Your Highness

722
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Pull the comfort of the loyal subjects

723
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,540
But Your Highness should also

724
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
Make a fake confession

725
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
To have an explanation

726
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,540
After all, Your Highness is still young

727
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Sometimes you should listen to the opinion of the elders

728
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Will walk less

729
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Your Highness said

730
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Right?

731
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Little boy is back

732
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,540
Father, uncle, aunt

733
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,540
I brought my sister and brother-in-law back

734
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,540
I knew I was right at home

735
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
The female army will definitely come back

736
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Marquis Wei's son is honored

737
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
This is the first time Marquis Wei came to Kang Jun

738
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,540
It is a big leap of the relationship between Wei and Yan

739
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Must celebrate

740
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,540
What are you doing?

741
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Why don't you look for me?

742
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Why am I looking for you?

743
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Brother, I'm looking for the female army

744
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,540
Uncle, aunt

745
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
It's good to be back

746
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I told you to serve Marquis Wei well

747
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Why did you forget the rules after leaving home for a long time?

748
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
And let Marquis Wei go to the house

749
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,540
I want to help myself

750
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,540
Marquis Wei can help himself

751
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Manman, this is your blessing

752
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Come on

753
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
It's good to be back

754
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Marquis Wei

755
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
I'm here

756
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,540
Zhang Jiao's brother-in-law is here

757
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Fan is back

758
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
Great

759
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
Both my daughters are back

760
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Marquis Wei

761
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Today, you don't have to take care of others

762
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
The house has prepared a meal

763
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Just come with me

764
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Father, mother, uncle

765
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,540
Don't worry, Marquis Wei

766
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
You helped me recover Liancheng today

767
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
If you need anything else

768
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
Yan State will not refuse

769
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
Long time no see

770
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
You are the commander of the Boya army

771
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
No matter what your identity is

772
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
As long as you treat Fan well

773
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
You are our son-in-law

774
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Uncle

775
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Marquis Wei has been tired all the way

776
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Let's go back to the house

777
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
By the way, I forgot to thank the general that day

778
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
If it weren't for you

779
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,540
I may not be able to find you

780
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Thank you

781
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Why is the family so polite?

782
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Although the brush is from the Qiao family

783
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
But after all

784
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
What Li Jun said is right

785
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Brother-in-law

786
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
That's a family

787
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
After talking for so long

788
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
Stand in the wind

789
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
Go home

790
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Let Marquis Wei and Manman have a good rest

791
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Sister Zhang is not easy to get tired

792
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Go home

793
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
it is good

794
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
No problem

795
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
So many people

796
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Pay attention

797
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Know know

798
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,540
Master, this Marquis Wei admitted to the pen system

799
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
I didn't admit you

800
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
Sister

801
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
Sister Zhang is so lucky

802
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Uncle still hates her

803
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
But uncle has not improved at all

804
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
If the grandfather knows, he will be angry

805
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Your grandfather didn't teach you to forget your elders

806
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
Be prepared

807
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,540
These servants

808
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
I served you before

809
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,540
Waiting here to greet you

810
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Welcome

811
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
How much

812
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
Thank you, Li Jun

813
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,540
They also made you a snack

814
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,540
I sewed a coat and I miss you

815
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
What did you prepare for me?

816
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Your house is all arranged for you

817
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
The incense is also your favorite flavor

818
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
I remember

819
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Today's dinner is also your favorite

820
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,540
It was arranged by your father

821
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
He has someone else in the mother's house

822
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Everything is in his heart

823
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
But he came to my house

824
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I always take care of others

825
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Please have some tea

826
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
It's in my heart

827
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,540
I don't know if it's hard or wrong

828
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
You go around with Marquis Wei

829
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
It's better to be casual

830
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,540
I'll take your sister Zhang back to rest

831
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
it is good

832
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,540
Let's go

833
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Ok, I just want to see where you used to live

834
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Let's go

835
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,540
You also go to find some acquaintances to play

836
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Yes

837
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,540
That was the front yard

838
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,540
This yard is the yard where my sister Zhang and I live

839
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
You Yanzhou is indeed a haolan grass

840
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,540
Everywhere

841
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
This place is warmer than the fish

842
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,540
The flowers are also blooming earlier

843
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
This is a pear tree

844
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I used to sit down and drink tea when I was free

845
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
I'll take you to see other places

846
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Mom

847
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Will you blame me

848
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Why do you say that

849
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
When you were in your house

850
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,540
You were also like a treasure

851
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
Be held in your heart

852
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
But in Weiguo

853
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,540
You are careful

854
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,540
I am not a dragon

855
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
But for you, there are no dragons

856
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,540
And I have never seen you so free

857
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,540
I did not do well

858
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,540
Nanjun treats me well

859
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
The days with Nanjun

860
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,540
I am very free and happy

861
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
That is good

862
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
That Kang Jun is your home

863
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
Yu Jun is also your home

864
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,540
The moon shines in the deep sea but the song is not sung

865
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:34,540
The moon shines in the deep sea but the song is not sung

866
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,540
The sunset is like a dream

867
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,540
And the long night

868
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,340
This way

869
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
And this way

870
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,540
When this moment

871
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,540
And this way

872
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,540
adapted the moon

873
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,540
The moon is in the sky

874
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,540
I realize

875
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
This time

876
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
This Singapore

877
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,040
?

878
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,540
November

879
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Same era

880
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
The moon is different

881
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,540
The background and the sky are different

882
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
And then

883
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
This moon

884
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,540
No sign

885
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

886
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

887
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

888
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

889
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

890
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

891
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

892
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

893
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

894
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,540
Waiting for you to appear.

895
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Like a wild rain falling on your eyebrows.

896
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,540
My heart is sad and I'm sad.

897
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

898
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

899
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

900
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,540
No matter how much I don't want to be, I miss you for this life.

901
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,540
This life is not forgotten.

902
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,540
I'm willing to cross the sea of ​​blessings to help you.

903
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Waiting for you to appear.

904
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,540
Like a wild rain falling on your eyebrows.

905
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,540
My heart is sad and I'm sad.

906
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

907
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

908
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

909
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

910
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,540
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

911
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,540
Only the longest yearning for you is left.

912
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,540
No matter how much I don't want to be.
