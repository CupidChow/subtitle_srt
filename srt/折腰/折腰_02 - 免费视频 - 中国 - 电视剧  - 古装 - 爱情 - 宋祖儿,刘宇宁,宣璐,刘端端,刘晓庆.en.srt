00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,010
Xindu was shadowed by death.

31
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,980
14 years ago,

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,260
tens of thousands of people died here.

33
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,090
Say no more.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,090
If Yanzhou

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,820
doesn't act in good faith,

36
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,460
you may go back

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,970
with the bride.

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,060
But this marriage

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,340
is my grandmother's wish.

40
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,930
So,

41
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
if you want it to happen,

42
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,060
the wedding must be held in Panyi.

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,490
- Tan.
- Yes.

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,300
Give the gift I prepared

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,580
to Miss Xiaoqiao.

46
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,770
Yes.

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,220
(Panyi Annals, Yanzhou)

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,050
My Lady,

49
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,740
if you ask me,

50
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,530
the Lord of Wei does like you.

51
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,780
Why don't you follow their arrangement,

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,510
(Culture)
hand over the seal of Panyi,

53
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,970
(Introduction)
and marry him soon?

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,810
This gift doesn't mean he likes me.

55
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,930
It's a threat.

56
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,810
(Panyi)
He's long had his eye on Panyi.

57
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,300
Even if I don't give it to him,

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,530
he'll take it through war.

59
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,970
Exactly.

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
So,

61
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,060
handing it over

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
doesn't really matter.

63
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,690
The dignified Lord of Wei

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,530
wouldn't go back on his word, right?

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,690
The feud between us

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,690
was caused by a broken promise, right?

67
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,900
To find a way out of this game,

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,090
we must find his weakness

69
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,650
and figure out what he truly wants.

70
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,340
(Yuyang Courtyard, Wei State)

71
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,340
What kind of person is Wei Shao?

72
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,850
He is

73
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,380
narrow-minded

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,610
and ruthless.

75
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,840
Let me tell you.

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,150
(Chunniang, Xiaoqiao's wet nurse)
This is not like home.

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,850
You must speak and act with caution.

78
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,290
Don't worry, Mother.

79
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,610
Look where you're going.

80
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,070
Can't you see we're carrying things?

81
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,850
What's that smell on him?

82
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,260
It's not from me;

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
it's from the chest.

84
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,850
Inside is Li Su.

85
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,530
Nonsense.

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,460
Li Su is tall and strong.

87
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,850
How could he fit in a chest?

88
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,900
Even Li Su didn't believe it at first

89
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,500
until he saw his own hands and feet

90
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,020
cut off

91
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,650
and placed inside piece by piece.

92
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
Then he believed it.

93
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,180
Look.

94
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,090
Generals,

95
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,820
we're new here and don't know the rules.

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,090
Please forgive us.

97
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,930
Forgive us.

98
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,380
Let me tell you.

99
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,580
The Lord

100
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,950
is not someone easy to deal with.

101
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,480
If you don't want to end up like Li Su,

102
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,650
learn the rules.

103
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,710
This chubby little girl

104
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,630
even threw up.

105
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,050
Li Su

106
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,290
killed three generations of their family

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,580
and slaughtered Xindu City.

108
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,730
Whatever happens to him

109
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,970
is no surprise.

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
To know how broad-minded he is,

111
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,290
you must see how he treats the people.

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,530
He treats them poorly too.

113
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,210
I heard people say...

114
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
The Lord has ordered

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,290
that from today onward,

116
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,340
everything

117
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,650
like this

118
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,490
is forbidden here.

119
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,500
Anyone who disobeys

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,600
will be punished severely.

121
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,930
Even praying for blessings
is not allowed?

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,850
How does he treat those close to him?

123
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,730
Suspicious.

124
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,090
I heard that the Lord of Wei
kills people in his sleep.

125
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,500
He never lets anyone near him
while he sleeps.

126
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,180
I think

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,850
he's just afraid of being assassinated.

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,890
Who is it?

129
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,140
I'm Wei Xiao.

130
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,980
My Lord,

131
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,260
the candle inside has gone out.

132
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,290
Shall we add more oil?

133
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,620
No need.

134
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,270
Come here.

135
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,290
Come here.

136
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,090
Are you stupid?

137
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,460
The Lord sleeping with the lights on

138
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,130
is not something
he wants others to know.

139
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,170
The Advisor said

140
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,090
we should act like we know nothing.

141
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,900
It must be hard on the Lord.

142
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,820
He was locked in that tiny wooden box.

143
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,050
If it were me,

144
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,820
I'd be afraid not just of the dark

145
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,210
but of the wood itself.

146
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,700
Say something, okay?

147
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,020
I can't even beat a word out of you.

148
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,900
Maybe if we speak louder,

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,250
the Lord won't be scared anymore.

150
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,210
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

151
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,970
My Lord.

152
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,490
My Lord.

153
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
My Lord.

154
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,180
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

155
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,860
(Grain)

156
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,680
You haven't finished counting
the households?

157
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,660
Leave.

158
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,010
My Lord,

159
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,780
the people of Xindu

160
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,530
suffered under Li Su for years.

161
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,340
They're still watching and waiting.

162
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,850
We'll need more patience.

163
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,680
- Where is this place?
- Is that Mrs. Wei?

164
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,700
- The people say
- Yes.

165
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,020
this is called Tan Terrace.

166
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,100
You can see all of Xindu from the top.

167
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,620
What a pity

168
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,020
it's now in ruins.

169
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,430
Let's go up and take a look.

170
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,390
Mrs. Wei,

171
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,220
the terrace has long fallen
into disrepair.

172
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,980
Be careful climbing up.

173
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,330
You can't call her that yet.

174
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,650
Our lady hasn't married the Lord of Wei.

175
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,530
Then when will you marry?

176
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,100
Please marry soon.

177
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,200
Yes, with a wedding,

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,890
the Lord of Wei
won't slaughter the city.

179
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,650
These days, he's counting households

180
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,260
so he can kill off all the migrants

181
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,380
from the border regions.

182
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,730
- That's right.
- Yes, Miss.

183
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,140
Please save us.

184
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,510
The roadblocks are enough,

185
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,370
but if the arrow towers
were a little taller,

186
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,620
the view would be better.

187
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,270
Look.

188
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,900
There's a woman in red up there.

189
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,020
That's Lady Qiao, right?

190
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,130
Yes, that's her.

191
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,810
Just like the rumors say,

192
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,220
she's beautiful as a flower.

193
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,810
Do you think
the Lord of Wei will like her?

194
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,860
When will they get married?

195
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,900
If they wed,

196
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,500
there won't be any more war here.

197
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,040
Showing off.

198
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,100
She's just pretty.

199
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,130
My Lady.

200
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,220
Xindu is truly in ruins.

201
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,810
So, you'll marry the Lord of Wei

202
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,900
in Panyi just like he wants?

203
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,380
We'll marry here in Xindu.

204
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,780
I think I've found the way out.

205
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,630
- Sir, give me a little money.
- Get lost.

206
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,350
Are you all right?

207
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,520
Thank you, Miss.

208
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,770
Thank you, Miss.

209
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,470
There's a deep pothole on East Street.

210
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,620
Our lady's carriage can't get through.

211
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,870
Is there anyone kind enough

212
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,960
to help clear the road?

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,870
Each helper will receive
five pecks of flour.

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,700
I'm willing to go.

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,770
We're all willing.

216
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,620
We're willing to go.

217
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
We all want to help.

218
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,720
My Lord,

219
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,580
the people have gone
to repair the streets.

220
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,480
Why?

221
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,170
They say Lady Qiao paid them generously.

222
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,980
My Lord,

223
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,840
the people have gone to repair the well.

224
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,740
Really?

225
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,960
Why would they dig a well for no reason?

226
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,890
Come on.

227
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,330
Everyone, eat up.

228
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,590
To thank everyone

229
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,690
for fixing the roads,

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,900
Miss Xiaoqiao prepared a meal for you.

231
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,130
She's so kind.

232
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,840
- She's used
- She gave us food and money.

233
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,320
- to drinking well water.
- How kind.

234
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,480
But the wells in the city
have been dry for days.

235
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,980
It's all right. Don't worry.

236
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,020
We'll fix it together.

237
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,410
- Shall we?
- Yes.

238
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,150
Will we be paid for digging the well?

239
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,100
- Of course.
- Eat up.

240
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,020
We wouldn't dare
trouble you for nothing,

241
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
would we?

242
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,170
That's wonderful.

243
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,100
I heard Lady Qiao also loves flowers.

244
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,840
Many people picked wildflowers
to give her.

245
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,860
(Grain)
Lady Qiao is truly something.

246
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,970
Shortly after she came,

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,140
Tan Terrace was restored,

248
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,280
and the roads were cleared.

249
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,290
Even the weeds and wildflowers
along the roadside

250
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,490
have been mostly cleaned out.

251
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
(Yuyang Courtyard)

252
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,820
(Changqing)

253
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,940
(Yuyang Courtyard)

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,050
I hope Miss Xiaoqiao likes them.

255
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,620
Thank you so much.

256
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,930
I hope Miss Xiaoqiao likes them.

257
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,820
Thank you.

258
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,410
I hope Miss Xiaoqiao likes them.

259
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,050
Thank you.

260
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,380
I hope Miss Xiaoqiao likes them.

261
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,260
Thank you.

262
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,650
This is way too much.

263
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,020
Stop them from sending more.

264
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,410
Flowers are of no use.

265
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,450
People like them

266
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,170
because they long
for what they represent.

267
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,290
Are you trying to say

268
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,330
the people love you

269
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,140
because they long for you too?

270
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,260
I didn't mean that.

271
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,330
The people treat me kindly

272
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,650
because they long for you,

273
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,530
waiting to see what you want.

274
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,860
Everyone knows

275
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,930
I'm a Qiao from Yanzhou.

276
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,390
Compared to the people from the border,

277
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,020
I'm the one

278
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,740
you despise most.

279
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,380
If you can set aside past grudges
and marry me,

280
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,170
it means you're magnanimous.

281
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,410
Then the people will no longer fear you

282
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,690
and will follow you.

283
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,810
You're good with words,

284
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,980
twisting things around

285
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,240
just to get me to marry you.

286
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,650
This is the will of the people.

287
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,260
So why not go with the people's will

288
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,450
and hand over the seal of Panyi to me

289
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,410
so we can get married soon?

290
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,220
Xindu has always been part of Wei.

291
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,500
I share the people's will and purpose.

292
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,530
Li Su was the first to sow discord,

293
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,930
and now you play mind games.

294
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,690
You both disgust me.

295
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,740
Don't think for a second

296
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,450
that I'm as easy to fool
as my grandfather.

297
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,780
As for the seal,

298
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,730
I suggest you make your decision soon.

299
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,290
I have some patience

300
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,860
but

301
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,410
not much.

302
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,740
The Lord of Wei

303
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,170
really is cold as stone.

304
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,410
If he were so easily persuaded,

305
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,140
it wouldn't be trustworthy.

306
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,100
So,

307
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,810
what do we do now?

308
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,500
My heart is like water,

309
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,690
and water wears down stone.

310
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,330
Turns out Lady Qiao is pretty tough.

311
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,500
The Lord fought day and night

312
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,740
just to reclaim Xindu.

313
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,140
Those flowers should be offered to him.

314
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,980
The Lord doesn't care for flowers.

315
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,140
Otherwise, he'd be like a weak woman.

316
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,340
Right.

317
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,690
Lady Qiao has managed to do

318
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,720
what the Lord has failed.

319
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,030
That's what's bothering him.

320
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,570
Good for you.

321
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,100
You're usually like a mute,

322
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,730
but now you've hit the nail on the head.

323
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Hey, give it to me.

324
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,890
- Whoa.
- Catch it.

325
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,140
My Lord, please spare us.

326
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,260
We didn't see you there

327
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,220
and offended you.

328
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,330
Are those flowers meant for Lady Qiao?

329
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,260
They are for you, My Lord.

330
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,410
You're a renowned

331
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,380
brave fighter.

332
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,230
I...

333
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,220
I heard

334
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,900
you'll be the new lord of Xindu,

335
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,170
and Lady Qiao is to be your wife.

336
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,620
So, I passed them to her.

337
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,780
Fine, hand them here.

338
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,050
I'll hold them for the Lord.

339
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:54,900
From now on,

340
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,690
don't bring useless things like this.

341
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,980
- Go now.
- Yes.

342
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,700
Thank you, My Lord.

343
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,690
Who says the Lord doesn't have
the people's support?

344
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,220
Seems to me the commoners know
who their lord is.

345
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,130
Then why won't they come and register

346
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,150
to collect their food?

347
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,980
Give them more time.

348
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,090
The thick ice didn't freeze in a day.

349
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,370
I've got some patience left.

350
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,780
Let's go.

351
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,820
Hyah.

352
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,660
Hyah.

353
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,740
Mayor.

354
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Help us.

355
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,950
Wei Shao's killing people
in the streets on horseback.

356
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,700
They've been counting households
every day

357
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,570
just so they can kill
all of us border folk.

358
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,050
They're trying to steal our food.

359
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,770
Even good families can't protect

360
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,520
(Zhen Mansion)
their daughters anymore.

361
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,220
Yeah, they treat lives like weeds.

362
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,610
Xindu has changed hands.

363
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,740
I'm no longer your mayor.

364
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,850
Though you have reclaimed lost land,

365
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,020
the people of Xindu today

366
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,700
are no longer subjects of Wei.

367
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,050
You wish to win them over quickly,

368
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,700
but they've been poisoned
by Li Su's lies.

369
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,460
They may not understand
your intentions at once.

370
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,500
Besides,

371
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,020
you didn't take Xindu

372
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,420
just to get revenge.

373
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,850
You have greater ambitions

374
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,810
and will need the people's help.

375
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,060
My Lord,

376
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,530
governing people is like managing water.

377
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,050
You can't rush it.

378
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,850
Now, let's see who runs out

379
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,810
of patience first between me and her.

380
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,320
(People's Wall, Wei State)

381
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,020
Back in the battle of Xindu,

382
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,260
countless families
lost their sons and husbands.

383
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,850
After Li Su entered the city,

384
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,180
he forbade the people
from collecting the bodies

385
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,420
and burying their loved ones.

386
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,090
So, whenever the people
could leave the city,

387
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,330
they would sneak out
to the eastern battlefield

388
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,090
to find their relatives' belongings,

389
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,620
hide them in their clothes,
and smuggle them back in.

390
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,850
This wall

391
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,290
was built from those very keepsakes.

392
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,020
But

393
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,780
as the years passed,

394
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,850
people gradually turned this place

395
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,090
into a shrine for prayers,

396
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,660
forgetting

397
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,940
(Nanny Zhong, Lady Xu's maid)
its true meaning.

398
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,610
To the people, this wall is a place

399
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,980
to grieve their loved ones.

400
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,770
To the Lord,

401
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
it's a memorial to the dead.

402
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,440
I came to Xindu this time

403
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,980
to ensure the marriage

404
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,060
between you and the Lord,

405
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,660
so Lady Xu can be at peace.

406
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,420
This is a wishing plate.

407
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,050
May your marriage

408
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,330
go smoothly.

409
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,410
Thank you.

410
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,220
(Stay united as one;
do not part in anger)

411
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,420
(Stay in health; grow old together)

412
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,460
Where's Wei Duo?

413
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,980
Didn't I order all this cleared away?

414
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,800
Why is it still here?

415
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,600
My Lord,

416
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,680
the people have kept this habit
for over a decade.

417
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,330
It's understandable
they can't change overnight.

418
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,150
What are you doing here?

419
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,210
My Lord.

420
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,130
I'm praying for the people.

421
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,090
Praying?

422
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,850
Do you know what this place is

423
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,610
and why this wall

424
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,090
was built?

425
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,370
How can you let her pray here?

426
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,850
How many of you still remember

427
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,460
why this wall exists

428
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,360
and who should be responsible for it?

429
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,860
Come on.

430
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,500
Take all this down and burn it.

431
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,090
Burn it all.

432
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
- My Lord, please don't.
- You can't burn it.

433
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,500
My Lord, you can't burn it.

434
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,330
You're ruthless.

435
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,130
You're not fit to rule Xindu.

436
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,330
You don't deserve it.

437
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,620
My Lord,

438
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,780
Zhen Zhi used to work for the late lord.

439
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,420
When Xindu fell,

440
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,050
he surrendered to Li Su

441
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,290
to protect the people.

442
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,130
My Lord, please calm your anger.

443
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,850
My Lord, please spare the mayor.

444
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,090
Please spare the mayor.

445
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,700
My Lord, please spare the mayor.

446
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,370
He's a good man.

447
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,220
The Lord watched with his own eyes
as his father, brothers, and people

448
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,850
were slaughtered.

449
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,740
How can he let that go so easily?

450
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,220
That's exactly why Lady Xu
wants to forge

451
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,740
a marriage alliance with Yanzhou.

452
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,570
Lady Xu feels sorry

453
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,090
for the Lord.

454
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,980
She hopes he can move on

455
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,180
and live with less pain.

456
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,570
My Lady, what are you thinking?

457
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,610
I think I know what he needs.

458
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,420
Li Su was a thief,

459
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,220
and you, Wei Shao,

460
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,460
are no better.

461
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,260
Back then, Li Su's army
pillaged the city for grain.

462
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,940
Now, you take control of Xindu

463
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,050
and force the people

464
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,570
to offer food, wine, and women.

465
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,220
How are you any different from Li Su?

466
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Yes, you're just like him.

467
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,420
Exactly the same.

468
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,220
The late lord was a righteous man.

469
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,890
You are

470
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,610
unworthy to be his heir.

471
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,180
My life is nothing,

472
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,500
but I pity...

473
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,500
What a pity that Xindu

474
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,530
has fallen into a bandit's hands.

475
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,070
My Lord,

476
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,290
kill this man now.

477
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,980
We can't let him confuse the public.

478
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,890
Yes, My Lord.

479
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,000
Yes. Let's kill him.

480
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,560
- Kill him.
- We can't let him live.

481
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,420
My Lord,

482
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,260
if you kill Zhen Zhi,

483
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,020
everything we've worked for
will be ruined.

484
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,130
Please punish him severely.

485
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,980
We fought so hard for Xindu.

486
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,220
Was it for these people

487
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,990
to insult even our ancestors?

488
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,570
My Lady, must you go?

489
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,420
This could put you in danger.

490
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,880
My Lord,

491
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,220
you must execute him.

492
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,180
- Kill him, My Lord.
- Just say the word.

493
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,330
I have something to say to the Lord.

494
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,610
Just in time.

495
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,290
Let her in.

496
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,180
This started because of you.

497
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,110
Aren't you going to say anything?

498
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,460
I just did a divination.

499
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,850
The wedding date is in three days.

500
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,130
If we miss it,
we'll have to wait a long time.

501
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,290
You keep delaying the marriage

502
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,570
because you just took control of Xindu

503
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,130
and have been busy rebuilding it.

504
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,810
But now, the people

505
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,420
don't obey you

506
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,940
or listen to your orders.

507
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,290
Will you have your soldiers

508
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,660
spend their days
making bricks and mortar?

509
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,460
I have a plan

510
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,260
to ease your troubles.

511
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,570
Most of Xindu's people

512
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,700
are migrants from the borderlands.

513
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,420
Since they refuse to submit,

514
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,090
why not

515
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,180
make an example of them?

516
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,500
Kill one to warn the rest.

517
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,940
If one's not enough, kill ten.

518
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,790
If ten's not enough, kill a hundred.

519
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,940
Keep killing until they obey.

520
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,780
You...

521
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,330
You venomous woman.

522
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,750
With this,

523
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,130
we can marry sooner.

524
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,330
As expected
of that jerk's granddaughter.

525
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,890
You wicked thing.

526
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,480
Last night he tried to kill the Lord,

527
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,460
and now he dares insult me.

528
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,810
We can't let him live.

529
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,810
We don't have to slaughter the city,

530
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,670
but at least his entire clan
should be executed

531
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,800
to eliminate future threats.

532
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,890
How vicious.

533
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,140
My Lady...

534
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
My Lord.

535
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,180
If I follow your advice,

536
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,660
how would I be any different from Li Su?

537
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,880
Your grandfather's betrayal
brought me to ruin.

538
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,890
And now you try to sway me

539
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,700
into slaughtering a city

540
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,050
for your sake?

541
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,810
You viper.

542
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,530
That's right. She's a viper.

543
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,940
- Kill her.
- That viper. Kill her.

544
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,780
My Lord,

545
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,700
please calm yourself.

546
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,290
Kill her.

547
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,020
Please calm yourself.

548
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,980
I was ignorant.

549
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,660
Please forgive me.

550
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,370
I will never forgive you.

551
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,180
You're so cruel.

552
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,050
You will not meet a good end.

553
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,090
You won't meet a good end.

554
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,290
This started because of Lady Qiao.

555
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,810
I will never fall for her schemes

556
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,370
to turn me against the people of Xindu.

557
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,850
As for the mayor...

558
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,290
You only pleaded for the people.

559
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,890
You're blameless.

560
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,610
Please rise.

561
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,020
My Lord,

562
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,850
you're just like the late lord.

563
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,810
After 14 years of Xindu

564
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,290
under the enemy's rule,

565
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,570
at last, we are back.

566
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,180
The Lord is righteous
and cares for his people.

567
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,500
The Lord is righteous
and cares for his people.

568
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,900
Thank you, My Lord.

569
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,810
Thank you, My Lord.

570
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,810
Thank you.

571
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,220
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

572
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,460
Luckily, the Lord is sensible.

573
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,330
Otherwise, the whole city

574
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,420
would've suffered for her.

575
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,810
So what if she's pretty?

576
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,290
- Get lost.
- That viper.

577
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,740
She's so cruel.

578
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,580
Indeed.

579
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,460
What's going on?

580
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,130
My Lord, you may not know.

581
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,840
The people surrounded Yuyang Courtyard.

582
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,370
Lady Qiao couldn't go back

583
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,980
so she had to hide on the Tan Terrace.

584
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,460
She's not so pretty.

585
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,780
It's just rumors.

586
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,130
I think she's just average.

587
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,330
Actually, she's kind of ugly.

588
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,570
Can you tell from here?

589
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,530
Why say she's ugly?

590
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,560
My Lord,

591
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,990
you mustn't marry this woman.

592
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,610
Send her away from Xindu now.

593
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,740
You may leave.

594
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,940
The Lord

595
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,290
will decide.

596
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,290
- Yes.
- Let's go.

597
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,130
Let's go now.

598
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,970
Let's go.

599
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,820
Let's go back.

600
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,980
You are so different

601
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,660
from earlier.

602
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,460
I know you put on that act

603
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,290
to help me out of trouble.

604
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,370
But what I hate most

605
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,020
is how your family

606
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,290
manipulates people at every turn,

607
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,460
always scheming,

608
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,180
thinking you can

609
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,740
control everyone.

610
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,740
Yet you don't know
that heaven follows rules

611
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,260
but people don't.

612
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,130
Still,

613
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,330
you're a bit better
than your grandfather.

614
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,850
At least you paid a price

615
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,420
for the show.

616
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,190
(Healing Powder)
Apply this on your neck.

617
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,130
My Lord.

618
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,090
I haven't congratulated you
on gaining the people's trust.

619
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,660
Nanny Zhong got this for me.

620
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,050
You should have it.

621
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,780
(Stay united as one;
do not part in anger)

622
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,420
What does this mean?

623
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,330
You're too young to get it.

624
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,330
It's about a couple
staying united forever.

625
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,880
What does it actually mean?

626
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,130
Say something.

627
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,940
(Stay united as one;
do not part in anger)

628
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,620
Next.

629
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,730
- Take it.
- Thanks.

630
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,890
Thank you. Thank you.

631
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,380
(Grain)

632
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,220
My Lord, thank you for the food.

633
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,540
Thank you, My Lord.

634
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,370
They'll all get some.

635
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,900
(Out for today)

636
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,180
That's all for today.

637
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,090
Come back tomorrow.

638
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,220
Out again?

639
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,980
It's out again?

640
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,700
- Don't push.
- I didn't get it yesterday.

641
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,660
- Don't push.
- I still didn't get it today.

642
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,220
Please give me some.

643
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,530
There's no food left at home.

644
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,500
Don't push.

645
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
Step back. Don't push.

646
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,550
What's going on?

647
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,060
The food ran out again today.

648
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,260
- Don't push.
- It's out.

649
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,330
There are too many people.

650
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,850
My Lord.

651
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,530
My Lord, please help us.

652
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,420
Everyone, everyone.

653
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,500
Please listen.

654
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,980
To prevent panic,

655
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,660
we distribute a certain amount
of food regularly every day.

656
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,750
If it's not enough,

657
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,850
we'll increase the supply.

658
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,610
Lies. Just give us food.

659
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,660
Give us food.

660
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,420
You will get it.

661
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,500
Please be patient.

662
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,570
I promise you.

663
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,220
No one will go hungry.

664
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,890
For today, please return home.

665
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,290
Alright. We trust you.

666
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,330
Come back tomorrow.

667
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,530
Fine. We trust the Lord of Wei.

668
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,900
- Thanks, My Lord.
- Thanks.

669
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,860
My Lord,

670
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,020
we got the people's trust too soon.

671
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,020
They all came rushing for food.

672
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,740
Once we counted, we realized

673
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
there were far more refugees
than expected.

674
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,570
Are you saying

675
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,610
the grain we brought from Wei
isn't enough?

676
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,530
This year's drought

677
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,020
has left all of Wei short on food.

678
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,810
The disaster relief grain we brought

679
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,020
was scraped together

680
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,180
by cutting rations across every region.

681
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,260
It'll be hard to get more.

682
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,980
But I already promised

683
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,130
that every household in Xindu
would have food.

684
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,380
My Lord,

685
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,580
there's a city

686
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,810
within reach.

687
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,180
(Panyi Annals)

688
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,810
Wei Liang.

689
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,320
Pull.

690
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,930
One, two, three.

691
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,180
I heard the Lord of Wei gave

692
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,850
all the army's provisions to the people.

693
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,580
Maybe he's not as ruthless

694
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,010
or vengeful

695
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,140
as we thought.

696
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,100
Even so,

697
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,700
if I give up Panyi,

698
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,180
I'll have nothing left to rely on.

699
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,810
My Lady,

700
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,840
the Lord of Wei has torn down
the People's Wall.

701
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,970
That wall was built

702
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,450
with the lives of the people of Wei.

703
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,650
But now,

704
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,180
it's become a symbol of hatred.

705
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,660
Instead of letting it keep you in fear,

706
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,620
I'd rather take it down.

707
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,100
I've suffered the pain
of losing loved ones,

708
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,140
so I won't let you suffer it again.

709
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,580
So, starting today,

710
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,330
the grudges from 14 years ago

711
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,810
are erased.

712
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,740
Whether you're from Yanzhou,

713
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,410
Bianzhou,

714
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,740
or Liangya,

715
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,220
from now on,

716
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,970
you are people of Xindu.

717
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,410
That's wonderful.

718
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,600
We finally have a home.

719
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,840
The Lord of Wei is so righteous.

720
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,940
Lord Zhen,

721
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,540
you risked your life

722
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,180
to speak up for the people.

723
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,700
It's admirable.

724
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,220
So, from now on,

725
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,890
Xindu will still be

726
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,540
under your governance.

727
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,980
Wei Qu.

728
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,580
As you wish,

729
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:27,810
My Lord.

730
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,780
Thank you, My Lord.

731
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,100
Starting today,

732
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,220
the soldiers of Wei

733
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,540
will work side by side
with the people of Xindu

734
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,970
to rebuild this city,

735
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,810
so you can once again

736
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,740
live and work in peace.

737
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,490
Live and work in peace.

738
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,220
Live and work in peace.

739
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:03,620
Live and work in peace.

740
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,930
Live and work in peace.

741
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,290
Give out the food.

742
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,620
Give out the food.

743
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,100
(Out for today)
Give out the food.

744
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,780
This can't be delayed any longer.

745
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,450
My Lord, please marry
Miss Xiaoqiao at once.

746
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,330
My Lord,

747
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,370
Miss Xiaoqiao is here.

748
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,180
Perfect timing.

749
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,620
The Advisor and I were just discussing

750
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,810
our marriage.

751
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,170
My Lord.

752
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,010
Miss Xiaoqiao, is there

753
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,740
something urgent you need?

754
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,060
On my way back from the post house,

755
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,810
I saw people still had no food.

756
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,930
But Panyi has food.

757
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,260
It could ease your urgent need.

758
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,800
You love the people like your children.

759
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,970
I'm sure one day

760
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,450
you'll treat the people
of Panyi as your own.

761
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,580
I'm willing to offer my entire fortune.

762
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,970
I only hope you'll accept me

763
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,330
and forge an alliance for the people.

764
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,260
We're not even married yet.

765
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,140
Why do you trust me so?

766
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,060
Because you're kind.

767
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,140
Kind?

768
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,540
You think I'm gullible, don't you?

769
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,540
Your family is far too naive.

770
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,930
Do you think a betrothal

771
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,740
can wipe out 14 years of hatred?

772
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,810
Do you really believe you're so stunning

773
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,620
that you could enchant me?

774
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,540
Qiao Gui is so scheming.

775
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,410
He planned this well.

776
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,360
He thinks he could send
his granddaughter here

777
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,800
to put on a gentle and sweet act

778
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,290
so I'd ally myself with Yanzhou.

779
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,660
Was this how he fooled
my grandfather back then?

780
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,580
Let me tell you.

781
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,140
Being fooled by your family once

782
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,060
was already enough.
