1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
There is a time gap between us,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,640
we still meet in prim silly eyes,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,720
oportunidad de Hashima

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,640
bacterial poison

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,320
I remember you knew

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,920
I loved you

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,520
but I turned my back on you

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,000
because of these deep feelings

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,960
I wanted to give you

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
I'll be waiting for you

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
The high-pitched song of the wind

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
will make me feel sleepy

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
I'll give you everything

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I want to be with you for life and death

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Is love the only thing that can last me for life?

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Why do I feel more and more pain?

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,960
I didn't get your ordinary care

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,960
I'd rather fall back

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,960
In your arms, I'm not the wind

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I pass through the mist and rush out to block the wind

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,960
I'll be alive until I die

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Only love can bring me to the end of the world

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,960
and make me your hero

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,960
The Legend of Chusen

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Episode 15

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
The Legend of Chusen

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Grandma Mai

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Grandma Mai

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Grandma Mai

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Grandma Mai

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Shiyuan

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Grandma Mai, you're all right

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
When did I fall ill?

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Qiao told me that you...

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I see

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll take my leave then

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Shiyuan

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Are you unwilling to see Grandma Mai again?

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm not a child

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm the mother of the Crown Prince

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,960
You can scold me or punish me

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I have no complaints

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
It's not your fault. Get up

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
It's my fault

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
I was too excited

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
I wanted to make a wish

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I didn't expect that

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I wanted to make a wish

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
to apologize to the Meis

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
How did you know your family name?

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
When I was traveling

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
someone found me and said

53
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
he was a subordinate of Chen's

54
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
He told me my family name

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Shiyuan

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
You know your background

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
but you don't know the full picture of the situation

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Your mother Qingyun is my only daughter

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
I love her

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
If I have a bright future

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
she will be captured by Chen Pang

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
and come back three years later

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
She will come back three years later

64
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
and you will be in her arms

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
After you are born

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
she will let go of the past

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
What did you say?

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Capture the stronghold?

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
When you were young

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I kept it a secret

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
When I was fourteen or fifteen

72
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
we had a heart-to-heart feud with Bianzhou

73
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
At that time

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,960
you wanted to get rid of Bianzhou

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
If I told you the truth

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
how could you deal with it?

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
I always told Zhonglin

78
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
to let go of the hatred of the Qiao family

79
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
But in my heart

80
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,960
I can't let go of the hatred of Chen Pang

81
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I shouldn't have mistreated you

82
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
and made you mistook yourself as a Viguo

83
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,960
It's all my fault

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Aisi

85
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Do you really treat me as a Viguo?

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Although in the past

87
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
you treated me and Zhonglin as the same person

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
Sometimes you treated me better than him

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
and preferred me more

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
But why?

91
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Every time it comes to military power

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
you don't let me guess

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Because you always have

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,960
the blood of Chen's family

95
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Okay

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Shiyuan

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Since your grandfather died

98
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I started the family court by myself

99
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
I can't trust you completely

100
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Plus Chen Pang

101
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
he wanted you to go to Bianzhou to be his father

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
If Bianzhou is the master

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
you will be the young master of Bianzhou

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Now that you've said it

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
you should make a choice

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
If you want to stay by my side

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,960
you will still be my grandson

108
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I will love you as I always do

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
But

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I will never be your only person

111
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
If you want to go to Bianzhou

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I will never force you to stay

113
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Then you can stay here

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
and kowtow to me

115
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
as a return

116
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
for all the years I've raised you

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Then you can leave the family

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
and never come back

119
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
I will never leave you

120
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I will never leave you

121
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
I will never leave you

122
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,960
I will never leave you

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I will never leave you

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Grandma

125
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
These three pictures

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
are to thank you for raising me

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I know you miss me

128
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
so I lost my mind

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I didn't tell you my birthday

130
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
From now on

131
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I will only be the wolf of the Fei family

132
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I will never leave you

133
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Are you relieved now?

134
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,960
You are so smart

135
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Since you praise me

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I will do my best

137
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
to help you do something

138
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
What?

139
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Madam

140
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Yes

141
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
What are you doing here?

142
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
You

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Are you here to see me?

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
It's cold at night

145
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
and the room is cold

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I made some soup for my grandma

147
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Take away your soup

148
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Don't pretend to be a good person in front of me

149
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
If it wasn't for you

150
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
would she punish me?

151
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
I never thought of hurting her

152
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
She wants to use the pulse

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
to pinch me

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Although you are

155
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
a member of the Wei family

156
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I don't like you

157
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
In the Wei family

158
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
she doesn't like me

159
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Now you bully me too

160
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I have been married for 20 years

161
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I have no credit or hard work

162
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Now I am in this family

163
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I am not even as good as an enemy

164
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I never asked my grandma to like me

165
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I just hope that she can be happy every day

166
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I believe that grandma is the same

167
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
This time because of the pulse

168
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
she suffered from the pain between my cousin and me

169
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I don't want her to be in a difficult situation

170
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
between her mother and her wife one day

171
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
This pulse

172
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
is my fault

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Zhu Lin

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
never came to see me since then

175
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
He must be blaming me

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Nanjun did get angry because of the pulse

177
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
But it's not grandma's fault to

178
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
compete for the pulse

179
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Grandma admitted to the crime because she was worried about Nanjun

180
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
It can be seen that grandma's love for Nanjun

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
is different from before

182
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Nanjun also loves grandma

183
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
but he is not good at speaking

184
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
so he asked his daughter-in-law to come to see grandma

185
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Really?

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Zhu Lin really thinks so?

187
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Zhu Lin doesn't blame me

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
But grandma

189
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
will blame me too

190
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
This punishment is more severe than the previous one

191
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I don't know when I can finish it

192
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Grandma, please don't worry

193
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
This punishment is different from the previous one

194
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
This time, it's kneeling down for the outsiders

195
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
As long as grandma kneels down

196
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
she and grandma will be a family

197
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Grandma

198
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Zhu Lin

199
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Zhu Lin

200
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Chen'er

201
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
You are a good brother in the army

202
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
You are a good brother in the army

203
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
In the end

204
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
you finally wake up

205
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Master

206
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
You can't be without a master

207
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Please take the post of governor immediately

208
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
Yes

209
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes

210
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Yes

211
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Yes

212
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes

213
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Yes

214
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Yes

215
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
Yes

216
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
From now on

217
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I will help you to stand up and change

218
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
I heard

219
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
You have been following my father since you were a child

220
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Then you and my mother

221
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
should know each other

222
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes

223
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Then I ask you

224
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,960
How did my mother and father know each other?

225
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Say

226
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Master and wife

227
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Master and wife are in love

228
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Love at first sight

229
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Say it's me

230
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You lied to me

231
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
My mother was kidnapped by Chen Pang

232
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
She died because of Chen Pang

233
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Right?

234
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Do you think

235
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
I am still alive

236
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
in Jin Yi Village?

237
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
You go back and tell her

238
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
These are all things she gave me

239
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I will take them all

240
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
And

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
I think she is not my father but my enemy

242
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
We will meet in the battlefield in the future

243
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I will kill her

244
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Chen Lie sent back the news

245
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
that the young master is not willing to go back to Bianzhou

246
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Don't worry

247
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Let him play for a few more days in Weiguo

248
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Now I am the master of Bianzhou

249
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I have the power

250
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
He will come back sooner or later

251
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
The master's hard work

252
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
The young master will know one day

253
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Su Ni

254
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
It's time to go to Dan Jun

255
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
What?

256
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Let her go?

257
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Her nephew is a little difficult to deal with

258
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
But the guards are investigating it in detail

259
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Don't worry, master

260
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
The peony flower shop Su Ni built

261
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
is so spectacular

262
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
It's hard to miss

263
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
This girl has a big reputation

264
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
It's hard to be in someone else's hands

265
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
and be a good example

266
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Pass my order

267
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
My nephew is not willing to go back

268
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I will kill him

269
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I have a word

270
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Let Su Ni guard her

271
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
No matter what, she must be found

272
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
I want to make a prelude

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
to the love of their couple

274
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Yes

275
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
The Bo family came to visit

276
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
They are all of the same race

277
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Why are you so polite?

278
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Sister

279
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Uncle

280
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
This yard doesn't even have a person

281
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
and a person

282
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Grandma has invited all the people

283
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
who wanted to visit here

284
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
for the past year

285
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Mrs. Tai has always been strong

286
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
This is because of the Qiao family

287
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Are you Qiao family

288
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
here to visit our Wei family?

289
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
The sale of seeds has nothing to do with the land

290
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
I hope you don't turn the tide

291
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
and wish for good people

292
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Good people?

293
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Can there be good people in the Qiao family?

294
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Let me tell you

295
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
14 years ago

296
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Don't mention it again

297
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
14 years ago

298
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
the Qiao family was not a fake

299
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
but it has nothing to do with the land

300
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Not to mention

301
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
the land is now under the rule of the Wei State

302
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
and the family is under the control of the West

303
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
You can't live with your family

304
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
You are all blinded by the Qiao family

305
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Thank you, cousin

306
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Why are you so polite?

307
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Do you want me to help an old man

308
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
bully a weak woman?

309
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Master

310
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,960
the sale of seeds sent by Yan State

311
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
has been so fast

312
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
that the female army has gained a lot of strength

313
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
She has also contributed to the mother's family

314
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Since the sale of seeds has been sent

315
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
the distribution of the seeds to the Long County

316
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
should be arranged

317
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Do you have a decision?

318
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Wei Xiao

319
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Yes

320
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Go to Pan Yi

321
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
and pick up Yang Feng

322
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,700
and escort him to the

323
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
But this man is the old man of Qiao Gui

324
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Yang Feng has always been a good man

325
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
He can't be responsible for the divorce

326
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
He should be careful

327
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Yes

328
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
14 years ago

329
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
the two families of the Yongning District

330
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
of Pan Yi went to the new capital

331
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
to build the palace

332
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Now there is a family

333
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Although Yang Feng has contributed to the Wei State

334
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,960
it's better to add one of his own

335
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Wei Xiao

336
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
go to the new capital

337
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
and send a letter to Zhen Zhi

338
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Tell him to go to Rong Jun

339
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes

340
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,960
But I'm still worried

341
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Rong Jun is far from Yu Jun

342
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
and is close to the border

343
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
It's not easy to manage

344
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
The good family of the Jun family

345
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
is very powerful

346
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
and is close to the Wei family

347
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Now the two families are getting married

348
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
I think

349
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
we should find someone

350
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
who is more promising

351
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I'll go by myself

352
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I'll send the name of Mai Zhong

353
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
to the Palace of the Lord

354
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
and do the construction of the canal

355
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
and also to the two people

356
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
of the Wei Dian Yu Yuan

357
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
It's great

358
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
And it's urgent

359
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
We'll set off in two days

360
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Sister

361
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
It turns out that after the Wei State

362
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
was destroyed

363
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
my brother-in-law was in a bad shape

364
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Wait

365
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
It's not long

366
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Don't

367
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Don't what?

368
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
The electric cloud is deep

369
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
My Ming Ge

370
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
It's a seal

371
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I didn't get it

372
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,640
I didn't get the

373
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
child of Guo Ji

374
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
I didn't get it

375
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Who is the master now?

376
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
It's Chen Pang

377
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
He finally got it

378
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
Now the situation has changed

379
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Chen Pang is ordering the whole city

380
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
to arrest sister

381
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
to search for the woman

382
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
with a flower in her hand

383
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
He said he would imprison

384
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
sister for life

385
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
You are so shameless

386
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
My husband died

387
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
He has given up

388
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
the idea of my mother's life

389
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Actually, this is not

390
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Chen Pang's idea

391
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
It's my brother-in-law's idea

392
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
But it's my brother-in-law's life

393
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
What did you say?

394
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Brother-in-law is afraid

395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Sister's mother's life

396
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
will be in danger

397
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
So before she died

398
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
he ordered Chen Pang

399
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
to imprison sister in prison

400
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
He only knows death

401
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
But he took liberally

402
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
to free her from a stranger

403
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Did you see it?

404
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
did you see

405
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:51,720
In reflected in the

406
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I was just thinking about you.

407
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Don't be sad anymore.

408
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
You are not worth anything.

409
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
If I had the support of a family like you,

410
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
I wouldn't have to suffer.

411
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I wouldn't have to suffer.

412
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Sister, it's not the time to talk about this.

413
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Let's think about how we can get out of here.

414
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,960
I never thought that my fate

415
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
would be in a slump.

416
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
This game of chess,

417
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
if I play it to this day,

418
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,960
I can't just let it go.

419
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,960
We can't take the people from the unit.

420
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
You go out of the city with me.

421
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
We'll make a plan.

422
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Sister, there are people outside.

423
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
How can I escort you out of the city?

424
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Send me the woman with the flower shop on her face.

425
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Yes.

426
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Stop.

427
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Stop.

428
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
What's wrong?

429
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
What's wrong?

430
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
What's wrong?

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
What's wrong?

432
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Hurry up.

433
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Keep searching.

434
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Yes.

435
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Sister.

436
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
This is Chen Pang's person.

437
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Sister.

438
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Aren't they looking for a woman with a flower shop?

439
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Now,

440
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I don't have one.

441
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Yong Ning will go to Rong County

442
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
and plant a plant.

443
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Rong County will be the biggest food supply center in the country.

444
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
So this trip is very meaningful.

445
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
I need to go there myself.

446
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Rong County has always been close to Weidian.

447
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Weidian has repeatedly provoked your family.

448
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Take this opportunity to teach him a lesson.

449
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Yes.

450
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
That's what I think.

451
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Then, let's go.

452
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Okay.

453
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Zhong Lin,

454
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
talk with the grandmother for a while.

455
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
I'll go tell them to prepare the meal.

456
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Wait a minute.

457
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
I have something to tell you.

458
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
We don't need to be so polite.

459
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,960
But you know I'm a man of food and play.

460
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Let's forget about it.

461
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
I went to Rong County to plant the plant this time.

462
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
But Yu Jun needs someone to guard it.

463
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
You stand here.

464
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
You just watch me.

465
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I'm hungry.

466
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Zhong Lin entrusted by this.

467
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Just help me once.

468
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I have nothing to fear.

469
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Zhong Lin,

470
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
please take care of your cousin.

471
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
I will do my best.

472
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I will not let you down.

473
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
You go prepare the meal.

474
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
I'll cook dinner in my room tonight.

475
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Yes.

476
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Zhong Lin,

477
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
this time I and Shiyuan

478
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
can talk about this.

479
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
It's all because of Qiao Shi.

480
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,960
You know it, right?

481
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I know.

482
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Qiao Shi is a good boy who knows how to read and write.

483
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I'm flattered.

484
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Zhong Lin,

485
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
there are some things

486
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
that have passed.

487
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm afraid you will go to Rong County this time.

488
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Just let go of everything you should.

489
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I have something to tell you.

490
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
I have sent Wei Xiao to send Yilan.

491
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
She is in charge of the Yangfeng Qu Rong County.

492
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Lan Jun trusts him so much.

493
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
I'll write a letter to him to warn him.

494
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Don't let him be dissatisfied.

495
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
No need.

496
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Sit down.

497
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
I have to make it clear to you.

498
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Although I know that Yangfeng has been interested in Yanzhou,

499
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I still doubted him.

500
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
This is all my idea.

501
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
So don't say anything

502
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
that will hurt the military.

503
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I know.

504
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Lan Jun trusts me.

505
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
So I should write to him

506
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
so that he won't let him down.

507
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't bother.

508
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
I'll go there in person.

509
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Let's eat.

510
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Lan Jun has been running around all these years.

511
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,960
He must have seen the scenery around.

512
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Unfortunately, I'm different.

513
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
From Kang Jun to Yu Jun,

514
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm the only one.

515
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,960
So I want to go around like Lan Jun

516
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
and see where Lan Jun grew up.

517
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Yu Jun is where I grew up.

518
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I heard Rong Jun has many mountains.

519
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It's different from the scenery of Yanzhou.

520
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,960
I've heard about it and I'm looking forward to it.

521
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
You want to go with me?

522
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
I can take care of Lan Jun's diet.

523
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
You don't have to take care of the diet.

524
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Xiaotan can take care of everything.

525
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,960
And I'm going to cultivate wheat this time.

526
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
It's not convenient to bring people.

527
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,960
There is also a special way to grow wheat.

528
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
What can I do?

529
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
There are seeds that don't grow.

530
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
There will be no fruit next year.

531
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
What do you mean?

532
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Actually, I taught the way to farmers.

533
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
It's not impossible to teach farmers to the people.

534
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,960
But I'm afraid that there will be some mistakes and troubles.

535
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
If the harvest is not good next year,

536
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
it will be a big deal.

537
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Or Lan Jun still doesn't trust me?

538
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
It's not that I don't trust you.

539
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
But there must be some dangers on the way.

540
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
It doesn't matter if there are dangers.

541
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Anyway, Lan Jun will protect me.

542
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I'm going to the farm.

543
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Okay.

544
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Then you hurry up and pack up.

545
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
We'll leave for the field.

546
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Okay.

547
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
The farm

548
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,960
There is no special way to plant.

549
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
Yes.

550
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,960
There is no special way to plant.

551
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Could it be that the female army wants to accompany the master?

552
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

553
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,960
This female army has always been smart and considerate of the people.

554
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,960
She must be thinking about the right thing.

555
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Maybe there is really some special way to plant.

556
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
She is not convenient to say.

557
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Or she is really worried about it.

558
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
She will have to go and see.

559
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
It must be this way.

560
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Okay.

561
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Then this time,

562
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
take it with you.

563
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Okay.

564
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
The farm

565
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
The female army is really considerate of the male army.

566
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,960
But why do we have to go with the male army?

567
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Silly child.

568
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
The farm

569
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Master, the horse is done.

570
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
The car has been sent away.

571
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
When do we leave?

572
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Wait a little longer.

573
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Yes.

574
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I told him not to follow.

575
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
He insisted on following.

576
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
This is troublesome.

577
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
If this is not good, change it.

578
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
It's pretty.

579
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
That one is green.

580
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
What about this one?

581
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
The one I wore last time was good.

582
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
And with the cloth.

583
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
This one?

584
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Yes.

585
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Who is good at it?

586
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
With a cloth.

587
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
It's annoying to wear a cloth on the carriage.

588
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Master, I'll go and have a look.

589
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Wait a minute.

590
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
A girl's dressing up is also a matter of life and death.

591
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
No hurry.

592
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
I'll go.

593
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Master, this time out.

594
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
I have my own idea.

595
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
When we go out, we go around.

596
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Master.

597
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Go around.

598
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Let's talk about it when we get there.

599
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes.

600
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Female army.

601
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
The male army is number nine.

602
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Go.

603
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
The male army looks at the female army today.

604
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
They are different from usual.

605
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Brother.

606
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Brother.

607
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Brother.

608
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Brother.

609
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
Brother.

610
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Brother.

611
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Brother.

612
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Brother.

613
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Brother.

614
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Grandma, I'm worried that you will feel lonely when you go to Jiangyuan.

615
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Let me see you off.

616
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Who told me to do nothing all day and be lonely?

617
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
If you feel lonely.

618
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You can get married early.

619
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Forgive me.

620
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
It's a long journey.

621
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Mr. Kongsun.

622
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Brother.

623
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
I'll leave this jade seal to you.

624
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Leave the jade seal to us.

625
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
You just take care of your sister.

626
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Yes.

627
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Sister.

628
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
You are still brilliant even if you are out of shape.

629
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Remember to eat more.

630
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Don't use those tricks of the wine house in Luozhou to make up for yourself.

631
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Let's go.

632
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Let's go.

633
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Go.

634
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Please.

635
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Ten taels.

636
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
It's windy.

637
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Close the window.

638
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
This is too domineering.

639
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,960
The South Army is just not understanding the army's bitter intentions.

640
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
It's okay.

641
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I'll understand after going this way.

642
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Xiao Tao.

643
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Xiao Tao.

644
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Xiao Tao.

645
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
What's wrong?

646
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
The road is bumpy.

647
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
If you feel uncomfortable, tell me immediately.

648
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Tell me.

649
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
You can stop anytime.

650
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
It's okay.

651
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
The army is good.

652
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
What's wrong with you?

653
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
You want to eat and drink.

654
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Tell me.

655
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
I...

656
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
You should be a good cook.

657
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Xiao Tao.

658
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Xiao Tao.

659
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
When we went to the army,

660
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
they were rushing to the road.

661
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
They could not care less about the army.

662
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
But now,

663
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
they know how to take care of the army.

664
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'll take care of you.

665
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Do you have anything you want to eat and drink?

666
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
What's wrong?

667
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Get some water.

668
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Water.

669
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Here.

670
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Take it.

671
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Here, sit.

672
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Sit.

673
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
This is raw water.

674
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
You can't eat it.

675
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
It's like a man's food.

676
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
How can I eat it?

677
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Here.

678
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
If you want to eat it,

679
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I'll give you another one.

680
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
Take it.

681
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Drink some water.

682
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
It's delicious.

683
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
I told you earlier.

684
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
You are a bad person this time.

685
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
You followed me instead of coming.

686
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
What's wrong with being a bad person?

687
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
I can see the scenery that the army has seen,

688
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
the road that the army has walked,

689
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
and to be with the army.

690
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I think it's worth it.

691
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
This is a good view.

692
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Look.

693
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Actually, I really don't understand one thing.

694
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Although the drought is severe,

695
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
the delivery of wheat seeds

696
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
doesn't need to be handled by the army.

697
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
The army is always smart.

698
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Can you explain it to me?

699
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
You don't understand, do you?

700
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I used to be a little clever.

701
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
I didn't care about the situation.

702
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
The army has been in the country for many years.

703
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
But I only read a few books.

704
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I can compare with women.

705
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
If the army doesn't tell me,

706
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
I may never understand it.

707
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
It doesn't matter.

708
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
If you want to know,

709
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
tell me.

710
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Bring me the map.

711
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Come on.

712
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Look.

713
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
This is Rong Jun.

714
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
The east side is Yu Jun.

715
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
And the street is narrow.

716
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Fifty years ago,

717
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Rong Jun was not the disciple of the Wei State.

718
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
My father-in-law was the chief of the Wei State.

719
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
My father-in-law was the chief of the Wei State.

720
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
So the one who has the power and the power

721
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
has the power.

722
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Why are you looking at me?

723
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Look at the map.

724
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
The map is a blessing.

725
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,960
It's not as beautiful as the beautiful scenery in the south.

726
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
The mountain pass is windy.

727
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,960
It's not as beautiful as the beautiful scenery in the south.

728
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
You are a little abnormal today.

729
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
You are a little abnormal today.

730
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
If you want to listen, then listen carefully.

731
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
But this Rong Jun is young and powerful.

732
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
He was also a famous local.

733
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
But this time,

734
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
the better the training, the better the field.

735
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
It takes a lot of people.

736
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm afraid it will affect his future strength distribution.

737
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
He may not be willing to do so.

738
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,960
It's a good idea.

739
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
It's a good idea.

740
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
By then,

741
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,960
we still have to think of a way to make it.

742
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Brother, I'll tell you something.

743
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
What?

744
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
There is a very good place nearby.

745
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,960
The mountain city there is really delicious.

746
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
It would be great to eat there.

747
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
How do you know?

748
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
I have a good friend.

749
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
He gave me a strategy.

750
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
The strategy is good.

751
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Do you also hope that the male and female soldiers

752
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
can be more quiet?

753
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Of course.

754
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Look at them now.

755
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
How hard it is.

756
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
The strategy says that

757
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
as long as you follow the strategy,

758
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,960
you can get along well.

759
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
