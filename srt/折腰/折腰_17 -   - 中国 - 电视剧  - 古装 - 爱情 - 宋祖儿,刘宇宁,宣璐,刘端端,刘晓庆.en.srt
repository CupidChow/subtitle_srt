30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,900
Xiaotao.

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,100
Let me tell you something.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,260
What is it?

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,220
There's a great place nearby.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,060
The delicacies there

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,660
are absolutely delicious.

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,220
If only we can go and eat there.

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
How do you know that?

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,060
A good buddy of mine

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,300
gave me a guide.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,500
The guide says it.

41
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,940
Don't you also wish

42
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,300
the Lord and the Lady

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,860
could grow a little closer?

44
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
Of course.

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,300
Look at them now.

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,700
It's so awkward.

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,860
The guide says

48
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,820
if we follow it on this journey,

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,050
their relationship

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,260
will definitely improve.

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,820
Really?

52
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,660
Yes.

53
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,910
The first step in the guide

54
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,080
is to have sour plum juice.

55
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,970
Think about it.

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,860
In this scorching heat,

57
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,980
how refreshing would it be to have

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,280
a chilled cup of sour plum juice?

59
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,620
Come on.

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,420
We can literally see our breath now.

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,540
Chilled, seriously?

62
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,980
Well.

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,740
It can cool them down, right?

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Fair enough.

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,160
I'm having a snotty nose
because of the heat now.

66
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,740
Then

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,860
we'll go have those delicacies.

68
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,260
What do you say?

69
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,380
Sounds good.

70
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,860
If anything goes wrong along the way,

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,820
we'll just turn back.

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,900
It's close anyway.

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,740
Now that you mention it,

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,540
it kinda makes sense.

75
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,540
But right now,

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,100
the Lady...

77
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,800
Are you even listening?

78
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,860
Yes.

79
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,860
This canal repair

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,180
involves a lot of manpower

81
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,020
and may affect
future power distribution.

82
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,140
So, he might not be willing.

83
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
Besides, he has support

84
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,420
from Wei Dian.

85
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,820
Let me ask you.

86
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,860
Can I trust you?

87
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,000
Of course.

88
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,420
- Can you guarantee it?
- Yes.

89
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
Can I count on you?

90
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,700
Just believe me.

91
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
Alright, I'll go tell the Lady.

92
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,540
You agree?

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,420
I'll get things ready.

94
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,980
(Sour plum, rice balls, hot spring,
Purple Sea, soup dumplings)

95
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,980
Wei Liang,

96
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,300
is this the place?

97
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,420
That's right.

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,700
Head 20 li east

99
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,300
and then 15 li south,

100
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,860
go through a forest,

101
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,180
and we'll see a mystical village
shrouded in mist and clouds.

102
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,620
My Lord, that's right.

103
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,020
There must be sour plum juice.

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,500
Are you sure?

105
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,860
The smell is sour for sure.

106
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,260
Why's it turned into an outhouse?

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,580
(Outhouse, 10 zhu/person)

108
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,620
My Lord, I get it now.

109
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,020
Who says there can't be
sour plum juice in an outhouse?

110
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,780
Ma'am.

111
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,940
Ma'am.

112
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,740
Was this place originally
for sour plum juice

113
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,480
and only recently turned
into an outhouse?

114
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,620
(Outhouse, 10 zhu/person)
Since my grandfather's day,

115
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,180
it's been an outhouse.

116
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,540
Come on.

117
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,820
The next stop

118
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,940
is Fanghua Hot Spring.

119
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Ma'am,

120
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,500
thank you.

121
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,820
My pleasure.

122
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Hot spring?

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,420
This is it?

124
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,740
No way.

125
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,180
It was a hot spring a few years ago.

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,420
Put that guide away.

127
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,380
Let's just go back.

128
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,060
Yeah, stop dragging us into this mess.

129
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,020
Look. The water's warm.

130
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,140
There must be a spring.

131
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,380
Why don't we dig a little deeper?

132
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,860
It could be a hot spring.

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,020
Wait.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,380
My Lord.

135
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,500
Where are you going?

136
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,060
We're going back to get our clothes.

137
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,600
You dig first; call us when it's ready.

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,180
No, no. My Lord.

139
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,740
Do you not trust me now?

140
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,420
No, I just don't trust
my judgment anymore.

141
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,700
Wait, My Lord.

142
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,640
Give me one more chance.

143
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,340
I swear I'll take you somewhere amazing.

144
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,220
Look.

145
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,820
If we go another 20 li west,

146
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
we'll reach the endless Chaoyin Cave.

147
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,380
We can stay there for a few days,

148
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,740
have some local delicacies,

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,900
and then go inside the cave.

150
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,900
Let me see.

151
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,420
Where did you say to go?

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,060
- West?
- Alright.

153
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,940
Let's go east

154
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,100
to the Purple Sea.

155
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,460
What?

156
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,820
It should be here.

157
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,940
My Lord.

158
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,060
Water's coming out, My Lord.

159
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,260
Look, My Lord.

160
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,180
This is the Purple Sea.

161
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,420
This is the sea.

162
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,500
Come and see.

163
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,380
Come and play. Come on.

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,380
The waves are chasing me.

165
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,620
Let's play, My Lord.

166
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,260
Have you ever seen this?

167
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,840
There are even seashells.

168
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,500
Look, seashells.

169
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,500
Hurry. Seashells.

170
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Isn't this just a regular sea?

171
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,140
What Purple Sea?

172
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,020
Where did you get that guide?

173
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,860
Come on.

174
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,060
This has nothing to do with the guide.

175
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,260
Just tell the truth.

176
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,580
Whose idea was this?

177
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,420
Do you know Qilin?

178
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,420
No.

179
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,540
He's got

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,580
a guard named Geng.

181
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,260
I can trust him with my life.

182
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,020
He gave me the guide.

183
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,140
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,620
So, you're fooled.

185
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,180
Tell your friend named Geng this:

186
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
His friend

187
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,180
has a bad name.

188
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,420
He can't be a good person.

189
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,960
Tell him to stay away from him.

190
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,020
Let's go.

191
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,980
I'm going with you.

192
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,260
You stay here and play.

193
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,110
- Yeah.
- Just stay.

194
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,620
Stay here and play.

195
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,740
Little shells.

196
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,740
Go and play. Go and swim.

197
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,020
My Lord,

198
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,020
there's a peach blossom grove
over there.

199
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,620
How about checking it out?

200
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,020
My Lord?

201
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,260
(Prefect's Mansion, Rongjun, Wei)

202
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,180
Do you remember what I told you?

203
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,220
Yes.

204
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,260
- Good.
- General.

205
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,100
Make way.

206
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,740
Why haven't you returned to Hanjun?

207
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,250
Leave us.

208
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

209
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,780
You're still worried
about state affairs.

210
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,920
(Yuan Wang, Rongjun Prefect)

211
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,140
Yet you don't know a disaster

212
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,500
is coming your way.

213
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,020
What disaster do you mean?

214
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,860
The Lord and his group

215
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,540
are heading here with wheat seeds

216
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,780
from Yanzhou.

217
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,100
Those steamed ones from the banquet?

218
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,100
Yanzhou sent a new batch later.

219
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,340
A weasel is helping a chicken.

220
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,660
How could it mean well?

221
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,260
The Lord believed Lady Qiao

222
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,320
and actually wanted
to try planting Yanzhou's seeds

223
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,660
on our land.

224
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,380
Lady Qiao has had the Lord
under control.

225
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,620
If I had known this,

226
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,260
I would've strongly recommended

227
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,460
the Lord take a concubine
at the memorial rituals.

228
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,500
There's more

229
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,660
to this.

230
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,660
If they were only escorting the seeds,

231
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
why would the Lord

232
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,500
come in person?

233
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,500
Is there more?

234
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,980
According to internal reports
from Yujun,

235
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,740
escorting the seeds is only a pretext.

236
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,740
Their real purpose in coming here

237
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,740
is to extend the Yongning Canal

238
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,660
from Xindu to Rongjun.

239
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,020
Though it's for planting grain,

240
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,740
we both know well

241
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,860
that Rongjun is far from Yujun,

242
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,140
which is conducive to preserving

243
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,100
your and your family's years
of power and glory.

244
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,780
If the canal is built,

245
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,140
Rongjun will be closely connected
to other places.

246
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,380
Then Rongjun

247
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,740
will really become
the Wei Clan's backyard.

248
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,260
This is to weaken local power.

249
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,980
The Lord's influence is growing.

250
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
We knew this day
would come sooner or later.

251
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
What should I do?

252
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,660
That's easy.

253
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,260
Can you guarantee

254
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,860
they won't have

255
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,620
any accidents on the way?

256
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,660
Are you having a headache?

257
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,140
How about I pressure
some of your acupoints

258
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,360
to relieve your fatigue?

259
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,500
Alright.

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,380
Are my hands too cold?

261
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,500
No.

262
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,780
Pressing the Fengchi point

263
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,860
can refresh and sharpen the mind.

264
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,660
No need to panic.

265
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,100
Alright.

266
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,140
My Lord, just relax.

267
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm going to Rongjun

268
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,380
to teach the method
of planting Yanzhou's winter wheat.

269
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,660
Most importantly,

270
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,660
I want to be with you.

271
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,860
I don't want to be alone at home

272
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,340
while you're out for official duties.

273
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,040
I don't want us to be apart
for too long.

274
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,620
Aren't you afraid

275
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,380
that I'll send you back

276
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,500
right after your teaching task?

277
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,020
I came with you

278
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,260
to take care of your daily life

279
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,860
and also

280
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,740
to assist you with state affairs.

281
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,340
I'm not a man.

282
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,140
I can't accompany you
to the battlefield,

283
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,500
but I don't want to stay
in the boudoir all day,

284
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,260
watching you leave early
and return late.

285
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,620
If there are trifles like this
in the future,

286
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,900
you can hand them over to me.

287
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,500
If you want me to go back,

288
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,900
you can still send me back

289
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,860
once we reach Rongjun.

290
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,500
You can easily decide

291
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,140
where I go.

292
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,980
My Lord?

293
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,460
I just want

294
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,540
to get closer to you.

295
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Over time,

296
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,540
you'll grow closer to me too.

Hyah.

334
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,980
Jump down. I'll catch you.

335
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,500
Hurry!

336
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,060
Jump!

337
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,580
I told you I could catch you.

338
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,420
My Lord.

339
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,340
You're hurt.

340
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,100
It's nothing. Just a minor injury.

341
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,940
Let's go.

342
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,060
My Lord.

343
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,420
My Lord?

344
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,340
My Lord!

345
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:18,260
(Post House)

346
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,460
The arrow was poisoned.

347
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,420
Fortunately, it only grazed the skin.

348
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,460
The Lord is strong.

349
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,500
His life isn't in danger.

350
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,660
However,

351
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,120
he won't wake up

352
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,500
until most of the toxin is cleared.

353
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,100
Where did those bandits come from?

354
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,640
How dare they poison their arrows?

355
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,940
There's something odd

356
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
about them.

357
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,340
Rongjun borders Gaonan of Bianzhou.

358
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,380
The border has always been chaotic.

359
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,780
Bandits are common.

360
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,660
But we were on the official road.

361
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,860
Bandits only show up on back roads.

362
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,780
From what I observed,

363
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,340
these weren't ordinary bandits.

364
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,260
They knew tactics

365
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,020
like trained soldiers.

366
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,020
What do you mean?

367
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,100
This attack must be related

368
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,580
to our trip to Rongjun.

369
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
So,

370
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,100
the prefect of Rongjun

371
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,020
sent the bandits?

372
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,500
I've heard the Lord mention him.

373
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,180
He wouldn't dare.

374
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,620
But he's close to Wei Dian.

375
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,060
If this mission succeeds,

376
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,780
it will shake the foundations
of power in Rongjun.

377
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,260
That means Wei Dian's interests
would suffer.

378
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,180
Do you think Wei Dian

379
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,580
would try to ambush the Lord?

380
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,420
Yes.

381
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,540
Wei Dian has never been loyal.

382
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,060
He probably saw this as a chance

383
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
to eliminate the Lord.

384
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,020
Let me kill him now.

385
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,860
I'll go too.

386
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,700
No.

387
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,380
It's only suspicion now.

388
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,740
We have no proof.

389
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,820
If we confront him too soon,

390
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,340
what if he accuses us

391
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,980
of slandering a loyal official?

392
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,580
He's not loyal at all.

393
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,540
We all know

394
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,020
what kind of man he is.

395
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,340
But the people don't.

396
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,300
Besides, we're in his territory.

397
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,580
If he's cornered,

398
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
he might smear the Lord's name.

399
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,660
The canal project
will also become harder.

400
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
So, what should we do?

401
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,980
The Lord is in no condition

402
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,580
for a long journey.

403
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,740
Luckily, we haven't gone far.

404
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,100
We could head back

405
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,260
and let him recover.

406
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,900
He can't recover on the way.

407
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,260
And if we retreat now,

408
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,140
they'll think this plan works.

409
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,540
They'll try it again next time.

410
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,620
Also, the best time to sow winter wheat

411
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,980
is near.

412
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,420
If we miss it,

413
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
the grain heads will be small,
and the yield poor.

414
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,060
So, we must plant the seeds

415
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,100
during the autumn equinox.

416
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,480
This is about people's livelihood.

417
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,660
So is the canal.

418
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,740
If it's not built,

419
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,860
the people will suffer.

420
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,220
My Lady,

421
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,260
I'm just worried.

422
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,420
We're not even in Rongjun yet,

423
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,600
and it's already so dangerous.

424
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,340
Who knows what will happen
once we arrive?

425
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,740
You should take the Lord back to rest.

426
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,580
I'll go to Rongjun.

427
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,860
I understand your concern,

428
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,820
but it's even more dangerous
to stay here.

429
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,500
This is no-man's land.

430
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,820
That's why Wei Dian dared

431
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,060
to send assassins.

432
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,020
Once we're in Rongjun,

433
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,820
even if Wei Dian makes a move,

434
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,660
the prefect won't dare.

435
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,020
We await your command, My Lady.

436
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,860
(Street of Rongjun, Wei)

437
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,340
(Rongjun Post House, Wei)

438
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,740
My Lord.

439
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,420
You're awake.

440
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,260
What happened?

441
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,100
Easy, easy.

442
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,860
Take it slow.

443
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,660
You were unconscious for two days.

444
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,180
The arrow was poisoned.

445
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,300
Where are we?

446
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,620
We're in Rongjun now.

447
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,620
By the way,

448
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,260
how is the Lady?

449
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,140
Is she all right?

450
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,180
She's fine.

451
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,100
We're lucky to have her
with us this time.

452
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,540
(Prefect's Mansion, Rongjun, Wei)

453
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,860
Switching to winter wheat?

454
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,100
Yes.

455
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,900
It's planted in the autumn equinox

456
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,740
and harvested in the fifth month
next year.

457
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,100
It's perfect for easing food shortages
between seasons.

458
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,900
Why choose Rongjun?

459
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,300
Rongjun suffers severe drought.

460
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,420
It urgently needs a solution.

461
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,420
With winter wheat,

462
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,820
the people won't have
to fear famine again.

463
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
But I heard winter wheat
isn't drought-tolerant.

464
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,300
What affects Rongjun's crops

465
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,780
is mostly drought.

466
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,420
Your method may seem reasonable,

467
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,100
but it's actually absurd.

468
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,180
Winter wheat

469
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,260
is indeed not drought-tolerant.

470
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,980
It requires twice as much water

471
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,900
as the spring wheat
currently grown here.

472
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,820
But the Yongning Canal

473
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,420
is about to be extended
from Xindu to Rongjun.

474
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,980
With improved irrigation

475
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,140
and good weather,

476
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,900
you have no reason to worry
about the harvest.

477
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,500
Can you guarantee the harvest

478
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,900
of winter wheat?

479
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,740
Yanzhou has long grown winter wheat.

480
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,820
It yields well.

481
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,660
Whether it's good or not
depends on what you say.

482
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,100
I've governed Rongjun for years.

483
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,860
I can't let the people take risks

484
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,100
just because of your word.

485
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,740
Are you

486
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,340
refusing me?

487
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,940
I wouldn't dare.

488
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,660
I'm simply thinking of the people

489
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,580
and speaking on their behalf.

490
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,100
If the Lord orders us
to plant winter wheat,

491
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,300
we'll only comply.

492
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,100
It depends on how much

493
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,020
the Lord values public opinion.

494
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,620
If there's nothing else,

495
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,860
please leave, My Lady.

496
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,060
(Prefect's Mansion)
He gave so many excuses.

497
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,020
Clearly, he just wants to refuse.

498
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,740
It seems like he's rejecting
winter wheat,

499
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,580
but in truth, he's rejecting the canal.

500
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,980
The canal is a state-level project.

501
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,580
He can't say no directly,

502
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,500
so he uses the wheat as an excuse
to challenge us.

503
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,860
How bold.

504
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,820
Aren't they afraid to be killed?

505
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,980
If you ask me,

506
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,100
you should

507
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,660
give the order on behalf of the Lord.

508
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,580
We didn't bring an army.

509
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,660
He's close to Wei Dian.

510
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,140
If anything happens

511
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,020
in Rongjun,

512
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,540
Wei Dian will surely send troops.

513
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,380
It's not the right time to push.

514
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,380
Is there really no other way?

515
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,580
Let me think.

516
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,820
(Rongjun Post Station)

517
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,180
My Lady.

518
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,860
The Lord has just

519
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,510
woken up.

520
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,340
He's sitting up, asking for soup.

521
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,580
You're finally awake.

522
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,980
My hand hurts.

523
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,980
It feels like you still have a fever.

524
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,020
Wei Liang.

525
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm fine now.

526
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,940
Don't worry.

527
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,420
By the way,

528
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,900
they said you met Yuan Wang?

529
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,220
Yes.

530
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
What did he say?

531
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,660
He acted like he was

532
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,060
against switching to winter wheat,

533
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,380
but really, he's opposing the canal.

534
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,540
He's just using it

535
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,100
to test us.

536
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,980
Yuan Wang

537
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,540
has been here for years

538
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,740
and has Wei Dian's military support,

539
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,980
so he dares to act so defiantly.

540
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,860
Don't worry.

541
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,340
I'll have Wei Liang go back to Yujun

542
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
to mobilize troops.

543
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,180
I could deal with enemy generals.

544
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,620
My subordinates are nothing.

545
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,140
I know you fight with great courage,

546
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,580
and in a few days,

547
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,380
Rongjun

548
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,060
will be in your hands.

549
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,980
But if it comes to war,

550
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,660
the people will suffer.

551
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,860
Besides, if we mobilize troops now,

552
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,020
we might miss the planting season
by accident.

553
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,860
That'll not be good.

554
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,060
Here's a piece of advice.

555
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,100
Sowing discord is the best solution.

556
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
How?

557
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,900
I heard Lady Qiao wants to meet you.

558
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,780
She'll try to persuade me.

559
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,340
You surely know

560
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,380
what to do.

561
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,380
Of course.

562
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,180
Wei Dian is deeply suspicious.

563
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,060
If we exploit that

564
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,540
and sow discord,

565
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,420
Yuan Wang will be left with no allies

566
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,100
and will have to rely on you.

567
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,340
Then you'll have

568
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,420
the canal

569
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,100
and winter wheat

570
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,100
as you wish.

571
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,620
My Lady,

572
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,020
the prefect of Rongjun is here.

573
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,500
Greetings, Lady Qiao.

574
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,860
I heard you're a skilled player.

575
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,300
Come and help me solve this game.

576
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,020
Mr. Yuan.

577
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,860
Please.

578
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,620
How brilliant.

579
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,820
I lost.

580
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,120
Thank you for the game.

581
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,620
Do you have time

582
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,540
for another match,

583
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
or are you

584
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,860
otherwise engaged?

585
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,260
No.

586
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,580
Not at all.

587
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,100
My Lady.

588
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,180
Please.

589
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,020
Thank you for the game.

590
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,140
My Lady.

591
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,580
It's getting late.

592
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,340
You'd best head back.

593
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,380
Thank you.

594
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,900
Where's my other shoe?

595
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
It was windy.

596
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,740
It might be blown into the stream.

597
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,100
Go buy a new pair now.

598
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,660
Yes.

599
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,100
My maid was careless.

600
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
Sorry about that.

601
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,140
What did Lady Qiao

602
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,580
offer you?

603
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,380
We only played Go.

604
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,820
Nothing else.

605
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,540
You only played Go?

606
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,420
Yeah.

607
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,660
I find it strange too.

608
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,100
I don't know what Lady Qiao

609
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,660
is up to.

610
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,020
I sat there all day.

611
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,540
Even my back is sore now.

612
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
I'm going home.

613
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,140
General.

614
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,220
Keep a close watch.

615
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,420
Yes.

616
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,660
(Prefect's Mansion)

617
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,020
(Prefect's Mansion)

618
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,100
Wei Qu acted so sneaky

619
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,940
as if he was afraid
of exposing something.

620
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,860
He carried a chest of treasure

621
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,140
into the prefect's mansion.

622
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,860
It must be a bribe.

623
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,020
Mr. Yuan.

624
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
The Lady

625
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,900
had servants

626
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
search along the river.

627
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,260
Your missing shoe was found.

628
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,860
It's just a shoe.

629
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,460
Thank the Lady for the trouble.

630
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,380
Just as you expected,

631
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,900
the prefect's mansion is under watch.

632
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,060
Wei Dian will definitely know

633
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,400
about my visit tonight.

634
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,020
In that case,

635
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,180
I'll leave it to you.

636
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,340
I'm going.

637
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,020
Not bad.

638
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,380
You're starting to act
like the Lady now.

639
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,100
The generals
are only cooperating with me

640
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,260
out of respect for you.

641
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,260
Good that you know.

642
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,840
How about some honeyed drink?

643
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,380
Sure.

644
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,460
Wait a moment.

645
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,740
I've been lying in bed for days.

646
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
I probably smell a bit bad.

647
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,900
Don't come any closer.

648
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,780
Should I help you

649
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,140
wash up

650
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
and change your clothes?

651
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,260
You'd sleep better.

652
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,100
No need.

653
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,300
For now,

654
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,180
just sleep in another room.

655
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,940
Chunniang,

656
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,620
prepare some hot water.

657
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,860
Yes.

658
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,580
What are you going to do?

659
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,740
No need.

660
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,980
Does it still hurt?

661
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,980
No.

662
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,140
The wound from Xiaogang just healed,

663
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,460
and now there's a new one.

664
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,300
It doesn't hurt anymore.

665
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,060
It's inevitable to get injured

666
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,740
when we fight on the battlefield.

667
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,220
Don't take it to heart.

668
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,460
You say it's normal,

669
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,660
but I don't want to get used to it.

670
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,540
I hope you can stay safe and healthy

671
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,140
and never have to get hurt

672
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,700
and risk your life again.

673
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,740
What do you

674
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,540
plan to do next?

675
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,060
I want to borrow two men from you.

676
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,300
Borrow two men?

677
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,860
- Propose?
- Propose?

678
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,060
Exactly.

679
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,300
Wei Dian's nephew

680
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,020
and Yuan Wang's daughter are engaged.

681
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,940
If we want to sow discord,

682
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,860
we have to start there.

683
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,500
Is Yuan Wang's daughter

684
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,900
pretty?

685
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,100
Does it matter?

686
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,330
Will you marry her?

687
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,580
Am I asking you?

688
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,300
If she were pretty, why not?

689
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,380
Go away.

690
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,100
Well.

691
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
I'm not marrying her.

692
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't worry.

693
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,380
Yuan Wang

694
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,100
will definitely refuse
because of his ties

695
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,380
with Wei Dian.

696
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,860
That marriage

697
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,700
won't happen.

698
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,020
No problem then.

699
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,980
That said,

700
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,180
this plan isn't perfect.

701
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,100
So, just go and propose.

702
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,580
The sooner Wei Dian

703
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,660
finds out,

704
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,500
the better.

705
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
Leave it to me.

706
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,940
To be honest,

707
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,580
my daughter is already engaged

708
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,760
to General Wei Dian's nephew.

709
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,580
As far as I know,

710
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,900
General Wei Dian hasn't written
the Letter of Marriage yet.

711
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,860
A verbal agreement
is still an agreement.

712
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
You may think it's binding,

713
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,740
but Wei Dian might not feel the same.

714
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,100
What do you mean, My Lady?

715
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,260
As far as I know,

716
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,620
General Wei Dian is searching

717
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,580
all over the state

718
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,860
for a suitable and marriageable

719
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,180
young lady.

720
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,780
No wonder he hasn't written
the Letter of Marriage.

721
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,940
Since General Wei Dian

722
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,220
is doing this,

723
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,300
it's okay for you to keep a backup plan.

724
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,900
Why not give the two generals a chance

725
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,460
for you to see

726
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,620
who matches your daughter better?

727
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,740
Alright, enough already.

728
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,780
What's it to you?

729
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,860
Sorry about this.

730
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,020
General Wei Qu is great.

731
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,140
Father,

732
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,460
I'm Wei Qu,

733
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,580
skilled with dual blades.

734
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,300
My hobby is...

735
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,900
My Lady.

736
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,140
My Lady.

737
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you okay?

738
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,020
Are you alright?

739
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,500
I'm fine.

740
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Please get up.

741
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,740
This must be your daughter.

742
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,580
You

743
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,460
may leave.

744
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,740
Even if you want to use
my daughter's marriage

745
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,660
to win my favor,

746
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,140
I still cannot agree
to switch to winter wheat.

747
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,500
You're overthinking.

748
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,700
These are two separate issues.

749
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,900
Even so,

750
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,180
I'll agree to neither of them.

751
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,980
Goodbye, My Lady.

752
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,900
Alright.

753
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,180
Let's go.

754
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,620
Father, goodbye.

755
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,020
Lady Qiao left the prefect's mansion

756
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,460
with a big smile.
