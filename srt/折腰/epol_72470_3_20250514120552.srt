1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You think I'm a good liar?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You Qiao family are too naive.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You want this one-off marriage

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to be the hatred of 14 years.

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you really think you're really a good man

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and can seduce me?

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Qiao Gui, the old thief,

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
has also made a good plan.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He wants to send a granddaughter here

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to play a little trick to be gentle

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and then he can trick me to ally with Yanzhou.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He was just like that

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
when he tricked my grandfather.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm telling you.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Tao of your Qiao family

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
will be enough for one time.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Tao of your Qiao family

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wei Hong,

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
are you going to break off the engagement?

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Not breaking off the engagement.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm just breaking through

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
your strong brotherhood.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Tao of your Qiao family

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
For the sake of this seal,

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll spare your life.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you have to pack up and get out of Xin Tu.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, right.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Remember to tell your family

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to wash their heads.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll be there.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Guards.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Take her out.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't hate me.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was wrong about you.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Inside.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Take her out.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's going on?

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Why are you holding my quilt?

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Give it back.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you letting them take things?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What's going on?

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's going on?

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm holding my box.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go, go, go.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What are you going to do?

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You didn't see the things?

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why are you holding our things?

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hurry up and take it.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That box.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hurry up.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, no.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That quilt.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Take it. Don't move.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The quilt.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That shield.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What shield?

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I said the quilt.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why?

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you taking our things?

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
General Wei,

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
didn't we agree to have a family reunion?

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are you pushing us out of Xin Tu?

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So much nonsense.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hurry up.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Go.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hurry up.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Get up.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stop.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, okay.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Get out of the way.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
General Wei Dun.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What Wei Dun?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wei Liang.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think there must be some misunderstanding.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My wife has gone to see Marquis Wei.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think Marquis Wei will get married soon.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You were pushed out of Xin Tu

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
because you were under the order of the Lord.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You little girl.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're quite strong.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hurry up.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Take the carriage and send her away.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why did you drive them out?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The girl was under their supervision.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How can I face the Lord?

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What should we do?

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What should we do if the girl comes back?

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hurry up.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Take the carriage.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lord.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not good.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The two families have already exchanged the marriage papers.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They should have arranged a marriage.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's wrong with that?

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They only allowed the Qiao family to break the contract.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They don't allow Wei family to have a family.

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But the Qiao family has already given the marriage papers.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Even if he doesn't give it to me,

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can fight it myself.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're right.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Moreover,

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
he didn't really give it to me.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's trying to get away from it.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He just wants me to marry him.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If I don't get rid of him,

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
they will only be able to get what they want.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They really think

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the hatred of the world

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
can be easily broken.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lord, you're right.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you think?

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No problem.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It makes sense.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Lord, you're right.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't remember.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But she's a woman after all.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Mu Ji Ting is being forced to die.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you talking about?

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A family matter

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
must not be exposed to women.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Xiao Tao,

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the most important thing now is to wait for the next step.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:34,460
Find a way to go to the

141
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Lord's Mansion.

142
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
It's a trap.

143
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
Kill them.

144
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Kill them.

145
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
It's the Crown Prince.

146
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
He's here to save us.

147
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,460
Kill them.

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Lord,

149
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
it's the Crown Prince.

150
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
Lord,

151
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
the bandits have been cleared.

152
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
He's not a good person.

153
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
Maybe he's here to take advantage of me.

154
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Did we just come out of the tiger's den

155
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
and enter the wolf's den?

156
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
Yulang,

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,460
what should we do?

158
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Cousin,

159
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm late.

160
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Did you get scared?

161
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Go down and have a look.

162
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Cousin,

163
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
Cousin,

164
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
I just knew that

165
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Cousin,

166
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
you would come to save me.

167
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Don't be afraid, Cousin.

168
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm here.

169
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
But

170
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
it's all my fault.

171
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Because of my family,

172
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
I couldn't save you.

173
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
I'm sorry.

174
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,460
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,460
Because of my family,

178
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Cousin and Cousin's marriage

179
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,460
is now being driven out of the city by the bandits.

180
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Fortunately, Cousin is not angry with me

181
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
and willing to save me.

182
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
But I'm afraid that

183
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Cousin will know

184
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
that Cousin did

185
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
and will be angry with Liang Yaogu.

186
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,460
It's not my wish

187
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
to be the one to blame.

188
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Cousin,

189
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
how about we take one game

190
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
and win it

191
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
to make up for the regret?

192
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,460
Cousin,

193
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
we are a couple

194
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
who made a bet in the past life.

195
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
We are a couple.

196
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
There is no need to be external.

197
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
Now,

198
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
we will go to the village

199
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
and discuss it in the long run.

200
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
But I lost my seal of the seal.

201
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,460
Cousin,

202
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
you are the seal.

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
With you,

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
I can't enter the city.

205
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,460
Cousin,

206
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,460
you are tired.

207
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Go back to the horse town and have a rest.

208
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
We will leave immediately.

209
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
OK.

210
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
A wife who was driven out

211
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
made the Prince's soul

212
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
be broken into pieces.

213
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
Don't worry.

214
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
She is not a bully.

215
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
She is a treasure.

216
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Don't worry, uncle.

217
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I won't forget it.

218
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
It's good that you know.

219
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
Remember,

220
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
no one in the Qiao family

221
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,460
is a good thing.

222
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
It depends on the person.

223
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,460
When you get married,

224
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
you don't even want to get out of Wanjing.

225
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Marry Wei Shao.

226
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Beat Bai Yichen.

227
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Go.

228
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
A woman can learn and sell.

229
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
It's good.

230
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
I thought Wei Hong

231
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
was pretending to be a star.

232
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
Xiaotao,

233
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
marry him.

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Get up.

235
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Say it again.

236
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Where is the Bo family?

237
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,460
The woman went with the Prince Liu

238
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
and destroyed the plate.

239
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Please go back to Kang County

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
and tell the Grand Master.

241
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
What did he say?

242
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
He said Pan Yi was the housekeeper of Yanzhou.

243
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
He didn't want to send her away.

244
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Why bother?

245
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Why bother with Wei Shao?

246
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Even if Pan Yi is lost,

247
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
I can blame him.

248
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Yes.

249
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Why bother?

250
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Brother,

251
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,460
send Pan Yi out as soon as possible

252
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
and take her back.

253
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Send her back.

254
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,460
But

255
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
it's not necessary.

256
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,460
I have my stubbornness.

257
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
I can't stop her.

258
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
But...

259
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
I have to go now.

260
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,460
OK.

261
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,460
OK.

262
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
OK.

263
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
Aunt,

264
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
I won't be naughty in the future.

265
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,460
I have to work hard.

266
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm incompetent.

267
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
I can't protect my sisters.

268
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
I have my own ambition.

269
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,460
I can't be as weak as your uncle.

270
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,460
I'm not his enemy.

271
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,460
Sit down.

272
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Have some water.

273
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
I miss my mother.

274
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I don't know how she is now.

275
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
I miss my mother and sister.

276
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
These days,

277
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
I have thought it over.

278
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
She told me that

279
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
she wanted to marry Marquis Wei.

280
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
She must have lied to me.

281
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I don't know how she is now.

282
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
Fan,

283
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I just

284
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,460
passed by the tea house nearby

285
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
and asked about it.

286
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
The girl was in the tea house.

287
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,460
Marquis Wei drove her out of the tea house.

288
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
She went to Pan Yi's place

289
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
with Liu Yan.

290
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,460
If you're worried,

291
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
I'll go to Pan Yi with you.

292
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Or

293
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
you want to go back to Kang County

294
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
and reunite with your family.

295
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
I can send you back.

296
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Although I want to be with you

297
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
forever,

298
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,460
I don't want to see you

299
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
crying every day.

300
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Fan,

301
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
don't worry.

302
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
I'll protect you.

303
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
Pizhi,

304
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
let's go to Pan Yi.

305
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
You said we should go to Pan Yi.

306
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
We've almost done

307
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
what we did in Xin Du.

308
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Tell the soldiers

309
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
to take over Pan Yi tomorrow.

310
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Yes.

311
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
Master.

312
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Why are you so flustered?

313
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Pan Yi reported that

314
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
the son of Liang Ya Guo, Liu Yan,

315
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
has been admitted to Pan Yi

316
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
and taken over the city's defense

317
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,460
since last night.

318
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
What did he use to knock on the door?

319
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
The bridge girl.

320
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Which bridge girl?

321
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,460
The one that Master threw out?

322
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Dad.

323
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
I should have killed her long ago.

324
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
Give me the order.

325
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
I'll kill her.

326
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
The bridge girl and Liu Yan ran away.

327
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
Now they're hiding in Pan Yi.

328
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Tell the soldiers

329
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
to follow me to the next round.

330
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
Yes.

331
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Wait, Master.

332
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,460
I think

333
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,460
there must be something wrong with this.

334
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
We should find the bridge girl

335
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,460
and ask her.

336
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
We have to find her first.

337
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,460
Find the bridge girl

338
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,460
and kill her.

339
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
Yes.

340
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Wake up.

341
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
Did you have a nightmare?

342
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
I won't let this dream come true.

343
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Have some water.

344
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
I'll go to the bathroom.

345
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
Mr. Liu wants to see you.

346
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
Master.

347
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Master.

348
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
Cousin.

349
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,460
I saw you last night.

350
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
I was in a hurry to catch up with you.

351
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Now that Pan Yi is in the corner,

352
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm here to discuss the marriage.

353
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
I understand what you mean.

354
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
But this is a serious matter.

355
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
We shouldn't be too hasty.

356
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
I want to ask you

357
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
about your father's opinion.

358
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,460
Why don't we

359
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
discuss it in the city hall?

360
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Cousin.

361
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
Look at us today.

362
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Let's not

363
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
follow the rules

364
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
and follow the rules.

365
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
If we keep doing this,

366
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
everyone will be exhausted.

367
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,460
I think

368
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
we should

369
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
do it in a simple way.

370
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
We've asked

371
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
Yang Feng, the county magistrate of Pan Yi,

372
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
to replace Zhou Mu.

373
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
It's easy to

374
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,460
do it in a simple way.

375
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Right?

376
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
Report.

377
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
The Liangya family

378
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
is giving a new bride

379
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
to the Crown Prince.

380
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
A big banquet

381
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
and a couple of marital affairs.

382
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
One million yuan.

383
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Ten pieces of Xuan Bo.

384
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,460
Five-color silk.

385
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
Twelve bottles of wine.

386
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Twelve bottles of white wine.

387
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Twelve bottles of rice.

388
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Twelve bottles of rice.

389
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
One snake's tongue.

390
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
One snake's tongue.

391
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Uncle,

392
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
you're a little anxious.

393
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
But I want to take over Pan Yi.

394
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
I have to marry Cousin

395
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
to make things right.

396
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
Cousin is right.

397
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
I'll listen to you.

398
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
I'm afraid that Wei Shao will come to seek revenge.

399
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,460
He will involve Cousin.

400
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Cousin, don't worry.

401
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
I have a good plan.

402
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,460
I will make sure that Wei Shao will not go back.

403
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,460
You have a good rest.

404
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
I won't bother you.

405
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
The family is in charge.

406
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
Close the door.

407
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Your Highness.

408
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Why do you come here?

409
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
I heard that the groom woke up.

410
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
I came to pay my respects.

411
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Cousin is too worried in the capital.

412
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
You don't have to worry about her.

413
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
If there's something wrong,

414
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
you can tell me.

415
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
I will take care of everything for Pan Yi.

416
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
Okay.

417
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
There's something today.

418
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Wei Shao will come

419
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
with the groom in 30 weeks.

420
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
He will be here soon.

421
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Wei Shao is here.

422
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460
I will make him die here.

423
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
Although this time,

424
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
you took the power of the bridge girl

425
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
and cut off Pan Yi's life,

426
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
don't forget that

427
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Wei Shao has Pan Yi's heart.

428
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
So,

429
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
if you want to

430
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,460
put him out of the city,

431
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,460
you must use the power of the people in the city.

432
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
You must use them.

433
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Remember,

434
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,460
the power of the people is endless.

435
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Go.

436
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I heard that Wei Shao

437
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
has three eyes

438
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
and four hands.

439
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
Four generals in the capital

440
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
are all so evil.

441
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
If they fight,

442
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
they will be out of the city.

443
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
He even cut Li Su into a human stick.

444
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Really?

445
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
The Qiao family and Wei family have a feud.

446
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
If we fall into his hands,

447
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
we will lose all our money.

448
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
We can't let him in the city.

449
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
Yes.

450
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
With the help of the Crown Prince of Liangya,

451
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
we can win the battle.

452
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
Yes.

453
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
The Crown Prince is the son-in-law

454
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
of the Duke of Qiao's wife.

455
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Liu Yanying's rumors

456
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,460
incited the people to fight against Wei Shao.

457
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,460
The workers are not afraid of Wei Shao.

458
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
But they use the people to fight.

459
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,460
Isn't it a little cruel?

460
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,500
It's

461
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,460
not your way to beat me.

462
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
Let me do it.

463
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
I'll fight.

464
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
What are you laughing at?

465
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
I can't fight장

466
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Bai kind is better than you.

467
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
cheaper

468
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Better than you.

469
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Haven't you done anything

470
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,460
for the front line?

471
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Ye Mangeeeeeeeeeeee

472
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,780
Even you, the Princess Lu'er,

473
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,300
can't convince me to meet you.

474
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,260
Yang Gong, you must be плат attention to

475
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,100
if he uses this to harm people,

476
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
he may kill or treat by kindness.

477
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,220
He must photo it down.

478
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes, Madam.

479
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,060
Are you a person

480
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,300
from the famous Q channel led by the emperor Yang?

481
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,100
That's right!

482
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,740
Yes.

483
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,740
I haven't been there yet.

484
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,340
Can you help us find a way?

485
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,460
No problem.

486
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,500
Just go ahead.

487
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,020
Why are you here, Cichu?

488
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,420
It's been abandoned for years.

489
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,620
What's so good about it?

490
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm not here to visit the water area.

491
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,620
I'm here to visit the temple and the forest by the river.

492
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,900
The forest?

493
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,860
Are you asking about us?

494
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm asking about the weather tomorrow.

495
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,460
How is it?

496
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,820
The wind is coming from the southeast.

497
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,220
If you want to use the sulfur to protect your stomach,

498
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,780
remember to use sulfur to protect your stomach.

499
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,260
It's the best way to protect your stomach.

500
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,380
You know it all.

501
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,740
Although it's a good move,

502
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,260
you must be careful when using it.

503
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,860
Don't go in the wrong direction

504
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,500
and hurt my people.

505
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
You've misunderstood.

506
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,380
Panyi is my home in the future.

507
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,620
The people are my people.

508
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,580
How can I sacrifice them?

509
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,180
I was too worried.

510
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,500
Please don't take it to heart.

511
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
I didn't want to

512
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,420
kill Wei Shao alone.

513
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,580
I wanted to kill the whole Wei State.

514
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,540
Fourteen years ago,

515
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,140
Qiao Wei and his family got together

516
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,740
to build Yongning Qu.

517
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,180
The water in Yan State

518
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,580
was used to cover Wei State's land.

519
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,420
And then the new poison was absorbed.

520
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,780
Yongning Qu was abandoned by Li Su.

521
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,660
That's why Wei State was in great danger.

522
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,220
Cousin,

523
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,140
Panyi Diba has been in the water for 14 years.

524
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,660
If we take it down,

525
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,860
what about the new poison?

526
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,380
I didn't want to use sulfur to kill Wei Shao.

527
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,900
I wanted to use sulfur as a bait

528
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,620
to destroy Yongning Qu's Diba

529
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,060
and drown the new poison.

530
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,260
And then Wei State was in great danger.

531
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,020
It was a good opportunity to break through.

532
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,700
Although Wei Shao should die,

533
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
the people are innocent.

534
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,820
Those who do great things do not fear small things.

535
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,060
It's only their fault that they are in Wei State.

536
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,940
So the crown prince loves his people so much.

537
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,660
He loves himself.

538
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,020
When Panyi becomes my brother-in-law,

539
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,740
I will love him too.

540
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,740
Why is the female wolf so aggressive?

541
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,020
Is it because she had a relationship with Wei Shao

542
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,380
and really treated herself as a female monarch of Wei State?

543
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Our female wolf only cares about the people.

544
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,420
Even Wei Shao would fall into the wall

545
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,460
to appease the people.

546
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,420
You are worse than Li Su, the traitor of the three cities.

547
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,340
I did this for you, cousin.

548
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,420
You have deep hatred for Wei Shao.

549
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,940
I won't plot against Wei State today.

550
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,020
He will conquer Yanzhou tomorrow.

551
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
He won't.

552
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,620
But you

553
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,580
are just satisfying your ambition

554
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,100
in my name.

555
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
These days,

556
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,500
the city is not peaceful.

557
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,460
You'd better not come out and make a mess.

558
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,580
Send your cousin back.

559
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,900
Protect her strictly.

560
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,620
Although Panyi is the price of a female wolf,

561
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,420
we should let her make money.

562
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,620
Take her away.

563
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,220
Yes.

564
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,980
What are you doing?

565
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,220
Go.

566
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
What are you doing?

567
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,020
The Crown Prince asked you to protect us.

568
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,820
He didn't say he would tie us up.

569
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,620
Why are you shouting?

570
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,420
This is just a kind of protection.

571
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Think about it.

572
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
If we are tied up,

573
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,820
we can't move.

574
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,620
How can we be surprised?

575
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,420
This is the most advanced protection.

576
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,620
This is the most advanced protection.

577
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,020
What are you talking about?

578
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Untie us.

579
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,420
Protect the family.

580
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,020
Yes.

581
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,020
You are so annoying.

582
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,820
Are you okay?

583
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,620
I thought Liu Yan would treat us like you.

584
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
Who would think that

585
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,820
you can be a street ball player?

586
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,420
You are better than a female wolf.

587
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,220
I think female wolves are better.

588
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,420
Although the female wolf looks fierce,

589
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,620
she doesn't talk back.

590
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,020
But she didn't tie us up.

591
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,620
She even drove the female wolf out of the capital.

592
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,220
Liu Shi Zi, no matter what,

593
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
she only wants to be nice to the female wolf.

594
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,220
It's not the time to say that.

595
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,020
We should think about how to escape.

596
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,420
There is a small thing.

597
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
There are people outside.

598
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,220
The enemy is coming.

599
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,020
Go in.

600
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,820
Yes.

601
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
lol

602
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,220
crooks

603
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,020
It's a dead end for us.

604
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,420
Round ate is still in my hands.

605
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,820
Shoot.

606
00:28:45,420 --> 00:29:11,820
Zhu Fei's family sent an embassy to Changping for an inspection of the

607
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
Italy on Arpine compañie,

608
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:22,860
The

609
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,160
good

610
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,180
among

611
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:41,740
her

612
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
haven't

613
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,080
Kill them!

614
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Kill them!

615
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,960
Tang, I'll help you.

616
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,040
Cheng Lu, when will you stop biting?

617
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
Tang, what are you doing?

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Tang!

619
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
No.

620
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
No.

621
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
You'll get hurt.

622
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,840
Be careful.

623
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,640
Don't hurt her.

624
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,080
Wei Haoyue, you'll get hurt.

625
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
You're so cruel.

626
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,880
If you do this,

627
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Zhen Niang will be heartbroken.

628
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Pan Yi is in a difficult situation.

629
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,960
Wei Shao will be in a difficult situation for two days.

630
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,640
Liu Yan has already

631
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
fixed all the flow.

632
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,640
When the time comes, he will destroy the dam.

633
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,960
Then the whole Wei State will be flooded.

634
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,360
What about the people of Wei State?

635
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,040
If Wei Shao wants to attack Pan Yi,

636
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,600
we can only fight with him.

637
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,280
How did you deal with the Wei family?

638
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,080
It's my fault.

639
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,400
I was just like a wolf chasing a tiger.

640
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,720
I didn't expect to be trapped in the city.

641
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,080
I can't let these people die.

642
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,840
You don't know where Liu Hong is.

643
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,720
That day, I saw a car on the road.

644
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
Liu Hong should be in the car.

645
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
I guess those Liu Hong

646
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
should be in the granary.

647
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
You should stay safe here.

648
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,120
Wait for me.

649
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,240
Girl, can't you go alone?

650
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,320
Who are you?

651
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,680
Come back.

652
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,400
What are you doing?

653
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
How did you get in?

654
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,240
The granary is heavily guarded.

655
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,960
Don't you know that

656
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,480
people who are free can't get in?

657
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Who are you?

658
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,240
Stop.

659
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,520
Stop.

660
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
What are you doing?

661
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,440
Stop.

662
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Stop.

663
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
You, search over there.

664
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Yes.

665
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,440
Don't look for pathways.

666
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,480
Keep a distance.

667
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,520
Come.

668
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Easy.

669
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,320
Master.

670
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,640
The organisations doesn'tMike ty saying

671
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,240
that everyone can live here

672
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,280
If the people believe him,

673
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
there must be something fishy.

674
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,760
He must have been

675
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
deceived by Liu Yan and Qiao Nu,

676
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,880
so he mistook me as an enemy who broke into the city.

677
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,880
Xiaomai.

678
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,160
Lian Huang.

679
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,280
What's wrong?

680
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
Master, it's Liu Huang.

681
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,800
Liu Huang is fierce.

682
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,080
He's a fierce horse.

683
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,400
Liu Huang?

684
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,000
Firework.

685
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,360
Firework?

686
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,960
It's going to hurt the people.

687
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,920
The king of Liangya Kingdom, Liu Huang,

688
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,120
was planned by Liu Yan.

689
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,960
I thought Liu Yan's tricks would be a trap.

690
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,800
But I didn't expect him to be so dangerous.

691
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,920
Judging from the car's fold,

692
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,720
there must be a way to destroy the city.

693
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,960
He must have planned to

694
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,240
light the fire

695
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
after we attack the city.

696
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
If we attack the city,

697
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,160
the city will become a hell

698
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,920
for the people.

699
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,960
Liu Yan is cruel.

700
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,760
He's more vicious than he was before.

701
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm not a good man.

702
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,040
I called my grandson

703
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,160
to be his backer.

704
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,280
Master, I'll order the army

705
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,960
to stop the attack and wait for the opportunity.

706
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,280
Fire!

707
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Hurry, fire!

708
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,360
Yes.

709
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,560
Hurry, fire!

710
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Some car has been set on fire!

711
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,040
Somebody, fire!

712
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,760
Fire!

713
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Fire!

714
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,800
그때

715
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,640
Stop the fire!

716
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,560
The car is coming!

717
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,040
Start killing!

718
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,640
You think I have hip Marvelous panels?

719
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,360
It was the car, not the Glue Boxes.

720
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Hurry, hurry!

721
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,640
We need to finish this!

722
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,280
Hurry

723
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,240
Hurry

724
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,360
The grain warehouse is on fire!

725
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,680
Hurry up!

726
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,360
Take the water!

727
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,480
The fire is burning!

728
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
Report!

729
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,880
The grain warehouse is on fire in Peiyin City!

730
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,640
The fire is spreading!

731
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,480
The city is in chaos!

732
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,280
Why did it burn down?

733
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,680
The fire is burning in the city.

734
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
Liu Yan is really a man of his word.

735
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
Liangya Country is in chaos.

736
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,080
What can we do?

737
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Larrips!

738
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,200
Head Buddhist

739
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,020
Sh 17 manifest the law

740
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,820
Sacred Sho lashes

741
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,680
Whenever he brings the coins,

742
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,000
people like the clothes

743
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,360
pick him.

744
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,860
We must pull out now!

745
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,720
Don't hesitate!

746
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Commander!

747
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Commander!

748
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,760
We can't hold on anymore!

749
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,440
We must leave now!

750
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
We can't hesitate anymore!

751
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
No.

752
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,680
I have to find my cousin.

753
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Commander!

754
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
The air force!

755
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Follow me!

756
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Go!

757
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
Catch the bridge girl!

758
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,640
Kill her!

759
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,080
Catch the bridge girl!

760
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,480
Kill her!

761
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Commander!

762
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Where's Liu Yan?

763
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,960
I haven't found her yet.

764
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,000
What about the bridge girl?

765
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,200
We haven't caught the people of the UN yet.

766
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,840
We really don't have time to find her.

767
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,880
Liu Yan ran away in a hurry.

768
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,600
It's possible that he took the bridge girl away.

769
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,960
We must find the bridge girl!

770
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,120
I want to see her.

771
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,040
I want to see her dead!

772
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Yes!

773
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Go!

774
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Go!

775
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,080
This is the place where the bridge girl lives.

776
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Search for her!

777
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Yes!

778
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
General Wei Liang!

779
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
General Wei Liang!

780
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
General Wei Liang!

781
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
I was about to find you.

782
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Look for the bridge girl!

783
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,640
The bridge girl is burning her eyes.

784
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,680
She's still injured.

785
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,960
Help me find her!

786
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,640
Don't let her fall into Liu Yan's hands!

787
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Stop!

788
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
You mean...

789
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,880
she set the fire?

790
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Yes!

791
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,040
Didn't you elope with Liu Yan?

792
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,440
How can you help us?

793
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
No, you...

794
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,680
Greetings, General Wei.

795
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm Yang Feng, the prefect of Pan Yi.

796
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,520
Our bridge girl was eloped...

797
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
by the bandits of Liu.

798
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
She's been trapped here.

799
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,560
Even I can't see her.

800
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,160
The whole Pan Yi incident is rumored.

801
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
Our bridge girl knew that the bandits of Liu...

802
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,880
would use Liu Huang as bait to destroy the Yongning Bureau.

803
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,680
So they sent someone to stop us.

804
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,480
Destroy the Yongning Bureau?

805
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,600
Destroy the Yongning Bureau?

806
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Yes!

807
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,880
Our bridge girl was so careful about Marquis Wei.

808
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,920
She set the fire and escaped.

809
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,400
That's why Marquis Wei...

810
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
made a good opportunity to attack the city.

811
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,400
You mean...

812
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
she was forced?

813
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Yes!

814
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,400
If Marquis Wei doesn't believe it,

815
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
you can see the fake memorials of the yard.

816
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,800
It's a good thing.

817
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,960
Even the memorials are here.

818
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
What's this?

819
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,800
This is a beast.

820
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,600
They didn't want to hurt the beast.

821
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,640
So they found a rat.

822
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,960
Marquis Wei, go save the bridegroom.

823
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,280
It's too late.

824
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,240
Liu Yan's people are looking for her.

825
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,720
So are our people.

826
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,640
Why are your people looking for her?

827
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
Remember!

828
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Let's go.

829
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Yes!

830
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,840
General Wen Xiao!

831
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,960
They would destroy the bridge and ruler Xiandu City!

832
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,200
You think I'm here to save you?

833
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
The war in the capital.

834
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,880
If you didn't betray me,

835
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,720
my father and brother would not have died in the war.

836
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
My mother

837
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,320
would not have died in sorrow.

838
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,200
I

839
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,440
would not have become a wild child

840
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,000
who fought with wolves.

841
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,120
So,

842
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,920
look.

843
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,360
нельзя

844
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
I can't see you.

845
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
I can't see you.

846
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
