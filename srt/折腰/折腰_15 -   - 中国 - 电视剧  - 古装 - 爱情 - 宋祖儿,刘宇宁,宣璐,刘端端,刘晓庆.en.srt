My Lord.

Should we continue weighing?

Shao,

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,020
if neither Lady Qiao

nor Wei Yan is behind this,

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,700
you owe us

36
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,220
an explanation.

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,570
- Exactly.
- Yes.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,420
- We must have an answer.
- Yes.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
How can our people be treated this way?

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,980
My Lord,

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,300
one is your wife,

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,800
and the other is your cousin.

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,300
Who will you choose?

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,800
Mr. Wei is just the Lord's cousin,

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,700
not his real brother.

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,460
You mustn't show favoritism.

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,460
Lady Xu.

48
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,580
Lady Xu fainted.

49
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,240
Grandmother.

50
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,580
- Grandmother.
- Lady Xu fainted.

51
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,780
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,970
Grandmother.

53
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,100
- Grandmother.
- Mother.

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,940
Summon a physician.

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,260
No one here is allowed to leave.

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,420
- Grandmother.
- Mother.

58
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,540
Grandmother.

59
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,900
Are you truly okay?

60
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Where is Shiyuan?

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,140
I've placed him and Lady Qiao

62
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,260
under separate watch.

63
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,820
Grandmother.

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,020
Why do you

65
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,860
suspect that Yan did this?

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,980
Zhonglin.

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,860
I dare not take the risk.

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,380
I understand.

69
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,420
You don't want Yan to suffer,

70
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,260
neither do I.

71
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,380
Even if

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,540
Yan actually did this,

73
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,260
I will ensure his safety.

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,020
Don't worry.

75
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,540
There is something

76
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,260
I must tell you.

77
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,460
Do you know

78
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,820
how our grudge with Bianzhou began?

79
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,000
It's because of my daughter,

80
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,300
your aunt Qingyun.

81
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,140
The rumors say

82
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,860
she bore Shiyuan

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,300
with a servant,

84
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,460
but that's not true.

85
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,260
She was assaulted

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,540
by Chen Pang from Bianzhou.

87
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,900
Chen Pang?

88
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,860
Yes.

89
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,620
Chen Pang abducted your aunt

90
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,540
when she had just come of age.

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,020
Three years later,

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,180
your grandfather brought her back.

93
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,330
By then,

94
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,860
she was already carrying Shiyuan.

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,420
Are you saying

96
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
Yan is Chen Pang's son?

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,660
Yes.

98
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,600
After giving birth to Shiyuan,

99
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,860
Qingyun died in despair.

100
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,820
Chen Pang,

101
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,180
for his own lust,

102
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,260
took my daughter's life.

103
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,260
If I ever have the chance,

104
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,940
I will kill him myself for revenge.

105
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,140
But Shiyuan is
Qingyun's flesh and blood.

106
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,740
After much thought,

107
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
I decided to claim

108
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,940
his father died

109
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
after marrying into our family.

110
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,740
And I raised him myself.

111
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,660
Then

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,580
does Yan know the truth?

113
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,500
I've deliberately kept it from him.

114
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,940
But this time,

115
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,380
Shiyuan seems

116
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,180
to have changed.

117
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,020
It's like

118
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,500
he's found something out.

119
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,620
Shiyuan is in charge of the granary.

120
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,020
If there's evidence against him

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,620
in front of everyone,

122
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,860
it would mean death.

123
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,500
Even if he made a mistake,

124
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,740
his life must not be forfeited.

125
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,380
Zhonglin.

126
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,380
We must find a solution

127
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
that spares both sides.

128
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm here.

129
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,380
Where? Hurry!

130
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,860
Why are you all so quiet?

131
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm telling you.

132
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,180
Whoever I catch

133
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,620
will have to spend the night

134
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,820
with me.

135
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,300
Why are you here?

136
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,580
Even though

137
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,620
you're the one I caught today,

138
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,860
I won't waste my time

139
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,820
spending the night with you.

140
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,060
Grandmother fainted because of you,

141
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,260
and you didn't even send someone

142
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,180
to check on her.

143
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
I know full well

144
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,620
how she is.

145
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,580
She's just putting on an act.

146
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,940
Don't try to trick me.

147
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,140
Then you should understand
why she's doing this.

148
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,900
Yet

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,720
you're here drinking with tavern maids

150
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
instead of trying to clear your name.

151
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,020
Understand her?

152
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,380
She refused to inspect the seeds

153
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,700
because she suspected me, right?

154
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,660
You stationed

155
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,820
guards here

156
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,280
because you suspect me too, right?

157
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,380
If I truly wanted to confine you,

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,580
would I let you

159
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,060
enjoy yourself here with tavern maids?

160
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,740
We're doing this to protect you.

161
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,860
Protect me?

162
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,260
Even you believe I did it.

163
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,180
You'd rather believe a Qiao

164
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
than believe me.

165
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,780
What about you?

166
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,100
Do you believe me?

167
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,180
What did I do to upset you?

168
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,500
Are you planning

169
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,180
to return to Bianzhou?

170
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
How did you know?

171
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,420
So, it's true.

172
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,060
You've learned of your origins.

173
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,860
Since you know,

174
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,180
why didn't you tell me?

175
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,660
We grew up together.

176
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,840
I saw you as my real brother.

177
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,160
So what?

178
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,380
I am Chen Pang's son.

179
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,780
I belong to Bianzhou.

180
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,900
I don't care who you are.

181
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,060
You are always my cousin.

182
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,420
Aren't you afraid
I'll covet your position?

183
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,900
Go ahead.

184
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,580
I'm the one

185
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,820
who tampered with the seeds.

186
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,420
You wouldn't trust me anyway,

187
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,700
and from now on,
you'll all be wary of me.

188
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,540
That's just your groundless guess.

189
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,660
What about Lady Qiao?

190
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,540
Why are you monitoring her letters?

191
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,100
Ehuang.

192
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,940
This plan may be clever,

193
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
but if the Lord of Wei
investigates further,

194
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,700
it will bring disaster upon us.

195
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,180
This scheme was never flawless.

196
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,140
But what I'm betting on

197
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,420
is the Lord of Wei's affection
for his family.

198
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,420
What do you mean?

199
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,940
Would the Lord of Wei
investigate his brother

200
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,780
for a foe's daughter?

201
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,140
The Lord of Wei

202
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,300
may be cold,

203
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,380
but he's always treated family well.

204
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,780
If the investigation

205
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,420
threatens his brother,

206
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,540
he won't continue.

207
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,260
The Lord stationed soldiers here
day and night.

208
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,540
We're not allowed to leave.

209
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,700
The Lady is clearly wronged,

210
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,900
yet there's nothing we can do.

211
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,300
According to the law of Wei,

212
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,180
we're to be executed.

213
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,460
Mother.

214
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,260
Don't say such unlucky things.

215
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,540
It's not about luck.

216
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm old.

217
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,180
I don't mind.

218
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,460
But you're still young and beautiful.

219
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,380
Mother.

220
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,420
I'd believe you

221
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,380
if you told me Lady Qiao wanted
to poison my whole family,

222
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,420
but I'd never believe

223
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,940
she'd harm the people.

224
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,060
What's this?

225
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,420
Why have I never seen it before?

226
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,420
This...

227
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,540
Isn't this the bracelet
you prepared for Lady Xu?

228
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,660
It's not that one,

229
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,940
but the style is the same.

230
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,460
Why does this box look so familiar?

231
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,020
You needn't worry
about the bracelet anymore.

232
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,380
The bracelet has been found.

233
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,780
Getting it back

234
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
is indeed better.

235
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,900
They're the same.

236
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700
Even if our bracelet
hadn't been recovered,

237
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,460
you needn't be afraid.

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,700
That bracelet was a token

239
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,140
from the Lord and me to Grandmother.

240
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,820
But this bracelet

241
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,540
is a token from the Lord to me.

242
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,780
Xiaotao,

243
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,620
grind some ink.

244
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Send off this family letter.

245
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,380
Sure.

246
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,780
The seed incident

247
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,260
can be seen as state affairs

248
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,780
or family affairs.

249
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,780
But Wei Dian is using it
to incite trouble.

250
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,020
My Lord,

251
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,540
have you decided

252
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,060
whether to investigate it?

253
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,300
If not,

254
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,660
the Lady will be found guilty.

255
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,760
But if we investigate,

256
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,380
and it involves Mr. Wei,

257
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,660
can the Lord kill his cousin?

258
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,940
My Lord,

259
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,920
this is a family letter
from the Lady to Yanzhou.

260
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,180
Please review it.

261
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,940
Sending letters at a time like this?

262
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,020
Confiscate it.

263
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,500
Yes.

264
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,620
Bring it to me.

265
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,180
I know this puts you in a tough spot.

266
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,780
No matter what you choose,

267
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,380
I won't blame you.

268
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,400
My Lord,

269
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,660
shall I still send this letter

270
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,020
to Yanzhou?

271
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
No need.

272
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,660
This letter

273
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,060
is full of nonsense,

274
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,460
rambling and incoherent.

275
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,780
Yes.

276
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm heading out.

277
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,020
No need to follow me.

278
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,860
My Lord.

279
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,540
There's a lead
about what you asked me to check.

280
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,940
Someone did visit the granary,

281
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,660
but there's no official record.

282
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,380
Good.

283
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
This must be

284
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,580
thoroughly investigated.

285
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,140
Yes.

286
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,420
Why was it returned?

287
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,300
Even letters can't be sent now?

288
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
Wait

289
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,220
for my return tomorrow.

290
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,380
Don't panic.

291
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,940
The Lord has his plans.

292
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,900
Six dan.

293
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,900
Two dan.

294
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,100
One dan.

295
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,380
My Lord.

296
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,280
Based on today's results,

297
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,420
a total of 24 sacks of wheat seed

298
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,780
weighs 21 dan.

299
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,780
Before entering the granary,

300
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,540
it was 24 dan.

301
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,940
The weight doesn't match.

302
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,820
So, the Qiao Clan didn't do this.

303
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,300
This proves the seeds

304
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,940
were tampered with in Yujun.

305
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,820
If so,

306
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,540
Mr. Wei should be held responsible.

307
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,300
Will the Lord
sacrifice family for justice?

308
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,900
The Lord is fair and impartial.

309
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,300
He'd even sacrifice kin

310
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,180
to uncover the truth.

311
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,460
Everyone, you're right.

312
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,540
The weight of the seeds

313
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,460
doesn't match before and after storage.

314
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,780
Whoever guarded the granary

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,850
can't escape blame.

316
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,700
We should punish Wei Yan asap

317
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,180
to appease the public.

318
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,180
Shao,

319
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
are you trying

320
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,940
to cover up for him?

321
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,060
Lady Qiao is innocent,

322
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,020
but I believe

323
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,660
Yan is too.

324
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,180
This is riddled with suspicion.

325
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,020
We must continue to investigate.

326
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,140
Until the truth is found,

327
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,380
no one

328
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,700
is allowed to leave Yujun.

329
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,820
The Lord is taking it seriously.

330
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,660
Could someone else
have orchestrated this?

331
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,940
No matter what,
none of us can leave Yujun now.

332
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,460
Where did things go wrong?

333
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,770
So, Lady Qiao really is innocent.

334
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,500
What did you say?

335
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,860
The Lord of Wei is going
to investigate this?

336
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,260
Ehuang, don't worry.

337
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,760
I've taken care

338
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,140
of Zheng Shu.

339
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,180
There won't be evidence

340
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,140
against you.

341
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,020
How did you know

342
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,140
the Lord would return today?

343
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,500
He told the Lady himself.

344
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,220
When faced with this situation,

345
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,900
most would rush to defend themselves.

346
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,420
But you're the one

347
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,500
comforting me,

348
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,100
telling me not to worry.

349
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,580
At Grandmother's birthday banquet,

350
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,380
you spoke up for me.

351
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,140
That means you believe in me.

352
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,340
So, even if this is blamed
on me in the end,

353
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,180
it must be because you have no choice.

354
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,220
I don't want
to make things hard for you.

355
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,140
I've ordered

356
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
a full investigation.

357
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
So,

358
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,180
it'll be some time before I return.

359
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,700
Sure.

360
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,940
My Lord,

361
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,940
everything is packed.

362
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
Then let's go.

363
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,220
Darling, wait.

364
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,820
My Lord,

365
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,940
please send off this family letter
for me.

366
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,260
You haven't told me

367
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,180
how you knew

368
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,660
the Lord would return today.

369
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,900
He told me himself.

370
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,380
What kind of riddles
are you two playing?

371
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,260
Are you saying

372
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,620
Zheng Shu secretly entered
the granary before?

373
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
She went multiple times.

374
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,180
It was very suspicious.

375
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,820
Wei Duo has gone to look for her.

376
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,660
My Lord,

377
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,220
I went to Zheng Shu's husband's home,

378
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,820
and I found out

379
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,320
Zheng Shu died suddenly last night.

380
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,660
With Zheng Shu dead,

381
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Yan could not possibly be the culprit.

382
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,700
There must be

383
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,240
a bigger mastermind behind this.

384
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,340
Pass down my order:

385
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,100
Continue the investigation.

386
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

387
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,260
Sir.

388
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,860
There's something I wish to ask you.

389
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,180
Please go ahead.

390
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,380
At home,

391
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,620
how do you address your wife?

392
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
I call her

393
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,780
Dear.

394
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,180
Understood.

395
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,460
(Thank you for your trust, My Lord.
I'll remember it always.)

396
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,020
(My Lord.)

397
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,960
Who's that?

398
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,860
Sir,

399
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,900
it's the Lady of Bianzhou.

400
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,420
Did you hear?

401
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,140
The Lady

402
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,740
didn't tamper with the seeds.

403
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,220
Luckily, the Lord is wise,

404
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,740
so she wasn't wrongly accused.

405
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,960
No wonder
that the investigation is so strict

406
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,900
and that we can't leave the city freely.

407
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,180
We have to catch the real culprit

408
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,260
and clear the Lady's name.

409
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,500
Maybe

410
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,930
the mastermind

411
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,420
is hiding among these people.

412
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,740
They're waiting
for a chance to slip out.

413
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,120
The investigation is necessary.

414
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,830
- Ehuang.
- The innocent can't be wronged.

415
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,380
What should we do now?

416
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,340
Why are you panicking?

417
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,900
If they have found the real culprit,

418
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,010
they won't need to check everyone here.

419
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,420
Lady Yulou, do you need to leave now?

420
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
General Wei Liang,

421
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,340
Great-aunt's birthday banquet has ended.

422
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,580
My husband is gravely ill.

423
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,960
I must return to Bianzhou at once

424
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,940
to care for him.

425
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,860
Please allow us to pass quickly.

426
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,700
The Lord has ordered

427
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,820
that until the seed case is solved,

428
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,040
no guests for the banquet

429
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,140
are allowed to leave Yujun.

430
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,260
Lady Yulou,

431
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,740
please cooperate with us.

432
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,580
Zheng Chuyu,

433
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,140
why did you act on your own?

434
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,220
You've even dragged me into this.

435
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,940
My Lady.

436
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Have you found her?

437
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,590
We did.

438
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,180
Bring her to me. I need to ask her.

439
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,460
She's been found,

440
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,580
but she can't answer any questions.

441
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,500
Zheng Shu...

442
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,220
What happened?

443
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,100
She's dead.

444
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,420
Dead?

445
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,380
How did she die?

446
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,310
How?

447
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,820
They say she drowned in the river

448
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,340
while doing laundry.

449
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,220
Drowned?

450
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,380
No. It's impossible.

451
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,940
Chuyu was good at swimming.

452
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,220
She couldn't have drowned.

453
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
Someone...

454
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,940
Someone must've wanted her dead.

455
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
Who killed her?

456
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,020
You need to be more careful.

457
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,740
If you keep acting recklessly,

458
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,940
one day you'll end up
hurting the ones close to you.

459
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,220
My Lady.

460
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,340
What's wrong?

461
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,020
Is it my fault

462
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,860
that she died?

463
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,380
It's my fault.

464
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,460
I caused it...

465
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,580
My Lady, don't say that.

466
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,620
Whether

467
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,700
Zheng Chuyu drowned

468
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,260
or was murdered,

469
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,500
it's already done.

470
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,380
From now on,

471
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,620
we must be careful.

472
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,260
Sure.

473
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,740
Besides,

474
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,940
now that Chuyu is dead,

475
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,820
there's no proof anymore.

476
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,420
The Lord won't trace it back to us.

477
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Who's there?

478
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,020
Coming.

479
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,700
Lady Yulou.

480
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,500
My Lady, Lady Yulou is here to see you.

481
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,500
Lady Zhu,

482
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,620
I heard Great-aunt is ill.

483
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,140
I didn't want to disturb her rest,

484
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,860
so I came to ask you instead.

485
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,460
Usually,

486
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,340
Mother loves Shiyuan the most.

487
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,500
But Zhonglin is defiant

488
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,460
and insists on uncovering the truth.

489
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,520
What do you think

490
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,660
we should do?

491
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,380
Don't blame the Lord of Wei.

492
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,180
In my view,

493
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,260
he's the one suffering most right now.

494
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,620
The seed case is serious.

495
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,660
You only see him
being scolded by Great-aunt

496
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,900
but not

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,500
the pressure

498
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,700
from all the factions in Wei.

499
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,180
If Shiyuan really did this,

500
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,860
the Lord of Wei

501
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,940
would have to kill him.

502
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,180
Right now,

503
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,420
he must be eager to find out.

504
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,020
Yes.

505
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,220
I'm just like you,

506
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,100
hoping this case

507
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
can be resolved asap.

508
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,820
Actually,

509
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,180
who the mastermind is

510
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,700
doesn't really matter.

511
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,460
As long as it's not Shiyuan,

512
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,580
the Lord of Wei

513
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,820
can breathe easy.

514
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,740
Shao.

515
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,140
(Peace and Prosperity)
How's the investigation going?

516
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,180
If there are still no leads,

517
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,380
then let me and the clansmen

518
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,620
- leave the city.
- Yes.

519
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,980
We've been here for days.

520
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,820
I've found someone

521
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,900
repeatedly entered the granary.

522
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,420
That person is Zheng Shu

523
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,040
who'd been serving my mother.

524
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,380
In that case,

525
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
bring her here.

526
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,460
We'll know the truth

527
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,580
with interrogation.

528
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,860
Unfortunately,

529
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,580
Zheng Shu

530
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,340
suddenly died last night.

531
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,260
She's dead?

532
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
So now,

533
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
she's dead,

534
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,180
and there's no proof.

535
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,940
Zhonglin,

536
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,980
this isn't like you.

537
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,340
You can't brush this off.

538
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,140
If you do,

539
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,600
every criminal in Wei will use

540
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,500
a corpse to plead innocence

541
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,820
tomorrow.

542
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,740
- That's right.
- Right.

543
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
He's got a point.

544
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,520
I can testify.

545
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,020
Everything Zhonglin said

546
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,460
is true.

547
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,860
Zheng Shu

548
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,420
served by my side for years.

549
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,460
She was

550
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,140
like a daughter to me.

551
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,260
Because of the family feud,

552
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,580
I wanted to get rid of Lady Qiao,

553
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,180
so I worked with Chuyu

554
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,860
to steam the wheat seeds

555
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,260
and frame the Qiao Clan.

556
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,380
Shiyuan

557
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,580
knew nothing of this.

558
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
That's the truth then.

559
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,380
But Lady Zhu,

560
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,820
you can't clear Mr. Wei
with just a few words.

561
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,100
Don't forget.

562
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,860
We have laws here.

563
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,660
No need to rush, General.

564
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,380
After Chuyu got married,

565
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,500
she was not allowed to visit me freely.

566
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,940
Each time she came,

567
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,460
I had someone escort her

568
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,980
to the side chamber.

569
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,100
If you don't believe me,

570
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,180
go investigate.

571
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,660
Everyone, please think about it.

572
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,260
Who was it at the birthday banquet

573
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,100
that insisted

574
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,820
on inspecting the seeds?

575
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,420
It was Lady Zhu.

576
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,100
This was a fight among women.

577
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,860
It doesn't concern Mr. Wei.

578
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,180
In that case,

579
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,700
it's not a political affair

580
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,260
- but a domestic one.
- Yes.

581
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,660
Since it involves the Lord's mother,

582
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,180
she can't be judged by law.

583
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,420
Lady Xu should be the one to punish her.

584
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,500
That's right.

585
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Yes.

586
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,220
My Lord,

587
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,420
this is the best way

588
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,740
to protect both the Lady and Mr. Wei.

589
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,220
Please decide.

590
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Open the city gates.

591
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,620
Let the clan members

592
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,860
return home.

593
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
We can leave now.

594
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,380
Take my mother

595
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,620
to the north chamber

596
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,760
and let Grandmother decide.

597
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,140
My Lady.

598
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,980
Take care.

599
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,900
I used to think
you were just slow-witted

600
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,180
but never imagined

601
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,220
you were so venomous.

602
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,300
Please calm your anger, Mother.

603
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,460
Mother,

604
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,100
believe it

605
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,500
or not,

606
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,220
I did

607
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,900
swap the seeds

608
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,620
as instructed by Zheng Shu,

609
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,580
but I knew nothing

610
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,660
about steaming them.

611
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,420
I know you didn't steam

612
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,100
the seeds

613
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,560
because you're not smart enough
to think of such a plan.

614
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,940
You're too dumb.

615
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,620
Even if you want to plot like others,

616
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,180
your scheming is half-baked.

617
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,660
From now on,

618
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,340
go to the ancestral hall.

619
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,380
Kneel and reflect.

620
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,360
Copy scriptures a hundred times.

621
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,760
It'll serve as a warning to others.

622
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,020
My Lady.

623
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,590
My Lady.

624
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,100
Zhonglin.

625
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,750
Though I am now

626
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,260
the Lady of Bianzhou,

627
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,420
there are things

628
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,860
I've never forgotten.

629
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,860
I once

630
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,740
spent my childhood here.

631
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,460
When my betrothal was on the table,

632
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,040
the elders chose your elder brother.

633
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,180
Sadly,

634
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I wasn't lucky enough to marry him.

635
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,420
Now, all I have

636
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,020
to remember him by

637
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
is this jade pendant.

638
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,180
Bianzhou is far away.

639
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
You should set out soon.

640
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,860
Take care, My Lord.

641
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,980
Take care.

642
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,480
♪On the rough potato branch grows a pod♪

643
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,870
♪A child wears a pointed ornament♪

644
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,130
♪With the ornament on♪

645
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,140
(Yujun)

646
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,020
My Lord,

647
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,420
what's the song

648
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,140
Lady Yulou just sang?

649
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,460
It's Wan Lan from the Book of Songs.

650
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,620
It speaks

651
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,820
of childhood companions

652
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,180
pretending not to know each other

653
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,410
after growing up.

654
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,820
♪On the rough potato branch,
the leaves curl♪

655
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,180
♪A child wears a pointed ornament♪

656
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,460
Ehuang,

657
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,420
don't be sad.

658
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,180
Why would I be?

659
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,580
In a few days,

660
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,380
I'll return

661
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,820
and be Lady Yulou again.

662
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,020
What's there to be sad about?

663
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,060
Besides,

664
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,380
though we failed on this trip,

665
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,700
we made it back safely.

666
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,540
I should be happy.

667
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,540
Lady Yulou, please wait.

668
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,980
Please don't return

669
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,460
to Yujun again.

670
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,020
Why?

671
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,460
Though you and the Weis

672
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,700
share a bond,

673
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,500
it can't endure further strain.

674
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,060
Now that you are the Lady of Bianzhou,

675
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,420
your interests oppose the Weis.

676
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,460
I don't know your purpose this time.

677
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,900
Though Grandmother said nothing,

678
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,220
she surely wasn't pleased.

679
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,220
I can't bear for her to be reminded

680
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,900
of unhappy memories.

681
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,020
So,

682
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,740
it's better if we don't meet again.

683
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,700
Shiyuan,

684
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,180
do you really think you're a Wei now?

685
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,740
Thank you for your concern.

686
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
But perhaps you should worry more

687
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,180
about whether you can truly

688
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,140
find peace staying here.

689
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,260
Yan,

690
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,020
I know you're here.

691
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,700
You don't have to see me,

692
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,660
but Grandmother is still waiting
for you to greet her.

693
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,130
Yan!

694
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,420
Young Master,

695
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,060
the Weis are good at deceiving.

696
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,700
You must not go soft again.

697
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,940
You carry the blood

698
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,700
of the Chen Clan of Bianzhou.

699
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,180
The Lord thinks of you day and night,

700
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,980
longing for your return to aid him.

701
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,220
With your talents,

702
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,140
will you really bury your ambition

703
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,700
and resign yourself

704
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,040
to a lifetime of submission here?

705
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
The Weis know your true identity.

706
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,460
They're suspicious of you

707
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,740
and even risked your life

708
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,300
to protect Lady Qiao.

709
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,700
Why not come back with me

710
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,980
to Bianzhou now?

711
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,780
My Lord,

712
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,460
are you still worried about Yan?

713
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,470
He's the one

714
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,340
most hurt by this.

715
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,260
I saw Grandmother today.

716
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,660
She misses him deeply too.

717
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,770
Chen Pang of Bianzhou

718
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,020
is bound to acknowledge him.

719
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,530
If we continue

720
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,730
to keep the truth from him,

721
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,460
he may leave for good.

722
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,540
It's true.

723
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,340
I've gone to see him many times,

724
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,460
but he keeps avoiding me.

725
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,580
I don't want to force him.

726
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,740
My Lord,

727
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,380
my situation here

728
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,460
is much like his.

729
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,420
I'm willing to talk to him

730
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,460
on your behalf.

731
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,820
If you trust me,

732
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,060
leave this to me.

733
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,380
What's this?

734
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,880
Since you've decided to build the canal,

735
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,620
I wanted to help

736
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,300
because I've studied some hydraulics.

737
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,620
The route for the canal

738
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,260
concerns labor and cost

739
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,820
so it's critical.

740
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,600
I've reviewed many materials

741
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,820
and made some notes.

742
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,980
I hope they'll be useful.

743
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,660
Tell me about it.

744
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,260
My Lord.

745
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,180
(Rongjun)
Look at these mountains.

746
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,500
This is the terrain of northern Rongjun.

747
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,740
I've read many materials.

748
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,820
This part is much higher

749
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,180
than Xindu.

750
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,580
So, if the canal starts here

751
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,900
and runs that way,

752
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,360
it'll take a lot of manpower
and resources.

753
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,140
But...

754
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,460
Come here. I can't see it from here.

755
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,300
Come on.

756
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,500
What are these

757
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,420
on the sides?

758
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,580
They're valleys,

759
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,780
which means there are mountains.

760
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,140
If we dig a canal through carelessly,

761
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,900
we risk disaster.

762
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,940
But if we follow

763
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,180
the valleys...

764
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,300
Good. Good.

765
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,260
Very good.

766
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,890
Good. Good.

767
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,940
Since Grandmother's birthday,

768
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,980
she's been weighed down with worry.

769
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,820
And you keep avoiding the Lord.

770
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,100
I had no other choice

771
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,650
but to disturb you

772
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,900
today.

773
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,260
I used to think our situations here

774
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,460
were alike.

775
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,860
As it turns out, I overestimated myself.

776
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,940
You're one of them.

777
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,100
I'm an outsider.

778
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,460
Is family

779
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,540
decided

780
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,980
by blood alone?

781
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,580
Even you've known it.

782
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,740
When I first came to Yujun,

783
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,060
no one saw me as the Lady of Wei.

784
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,940
They only thought

785
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,100
I was a foe's daughter.

786
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,010
I was uneasy.

787
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,180
But now, I've earned the Lord's trust

788
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,100
and Grandmother's affection.

789
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,500
Why do you think that is?

790
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,980
Because you're a Wei now.

791
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,740
If you admit you're not a Qiao,

792
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,220
Zhonglin and Grandmother

793
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,820
won't give you a hard time.

794
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,620
You're wrong again.

795
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,940
If I denied my Qiao blood,

796
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,460
the Lord wouldn't treat me well.

797
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,260
He'd look down on me.

798
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,460
I am the Lady of Wei,

799
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,740
so I'd never do anything to harm Wei.

800
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,460
But I was born in Yanzhou.

801
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,620
I'll never betray my homeland.

802
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,580
I've never hidden my concern

803
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,900
for Yanzhou's people from the Lord.

804
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,740
Only with such honesty between us

805
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,660
can we truly trust one another.

806
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,620
You speak so beautifully.

807
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,340
Only when I see myself as a Wei

808
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,890
can the Lord see me as one of his own.

809
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,500
It's the same with you.

810
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,580
I see myself as a Wei,

811
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,020
but the Weis treat me

812
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,580
as a discarded pawn.

813
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,660
You think you're discarded,

814
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,900
and no one cares about you.

815
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,420
But Grandmother

816
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,860
has fallen ill because of you.

817
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,460
She has always been in good health.

818
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,940
Yet she fainted when she heard

819
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,620
the Lord would reopen the case

820
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,820
and might punish you.

821
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,460
How is she now?

822
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,340
Did the physician see her?

823
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,380
Don't worry. It's nothing serious.

824
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,980
But she's still bedridden.

825
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,940
I dare say

826
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,860
she didn't tell you

827
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,020
not because she feared trouble,

828
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,540
but because she feared
that her most beloved grandson

829
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,180
would hold a grudge

830
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,460
and refuse to see her.

831
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,020
Grandmother...

832
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,460
Grandmother.

833
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,620
Grandmother?

834
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,580
Shiyuan.

835
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,620
I understand now.

836
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,720
I'm glad that you're fine.

837
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,460
I'll take my leave.

838
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,780
Shiyuan.

839
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,020
Are you never going

840
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,420
