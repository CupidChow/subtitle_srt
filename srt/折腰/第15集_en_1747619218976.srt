00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The song of the wind will make me feel sleepy

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll give you everything

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Could it be that love is what I've been waiting for all my life?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why do I feel so lonely?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The moon will fall again

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you're in my arms and I'm not the wind

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll cross that mysterious and rush to the wind

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'll be with you for the rest of my life

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Only love can make the sky and sea bright

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I'll be your hero

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Master

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is it done?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Zhi'er

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not your doing

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
nor Wei Yan's

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You should explain it to your relatives

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You must explain it to us

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How can you treat us like this?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Master

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
One is a female soldier

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and the other is a cousin

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What choice do you make?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The army is a guard

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but why are you so close to him?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't hide from me

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's Chusen

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They fainted

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Grandma

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Grandma

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Grandma

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Grandma

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Grandma

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Grandma

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Chen Xinyi

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No one is allowed to leave

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Grandma

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Grandma

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Grandma

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you really okay?

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Where's Shi Yuan?

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've taken care of him and Qiao Shi separately

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Grandma

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why do you think this is done by your cousin?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Zhong Lin

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't read

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I understand

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You care about your grandson

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but I also care about my cousin

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Even if this is done by your cousin

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can definitely protect him

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't worry

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I need to tell you something

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
how we made a compromise with the border?

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My daughter

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Li Gugu Qingyun

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
is said to have made a compromise with her and her family

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But she was killed by Chen Pang from the border

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Chen Pang?

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Li Gugu Qingyun was just attacked

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and was taken away by Chen Pang from the border

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Three years later

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
your grandfather took her back

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But she's already pregnant with Shi Yuan

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You mean

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
your cousin is dead?

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
After Shi Yuan was born

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Qingyun was pregnant

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Chen Pang

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
killed my daughter because of her desire

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If I have a chance

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I must kill her and take revenge

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But Shi Yuan is Qingyun's blood

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've thought about it again

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and decided to kill her

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've thought about it again

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and decided to tell the world

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that her father died after falling into the trap

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I raised her

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So did you know about it?

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I've been hiding it

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But this time, Shi Yuan came back

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's different from before

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It seems that he knows something

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Shi Yuan is in charge of the warehouse

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If he finds out about it in front of the family

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
he'll be dead

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if he did something wrong

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
he can't lose his life

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Zhong Li

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
you must think of a way to make it happen

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Where?

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry up

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You don't need to make any noise

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm telling you

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll accompany you to the food store

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OK

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why are you here?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Although I caught you today

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't waste my time

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to spend time with you

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I know

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Your grandmother fainted because of you

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't know to send someone to visit me

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and say hello

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I know very well

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
how your grandmother is

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She just did it

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't lie to me

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You should know

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
how much she has done

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But you

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You don't want to prove yourself

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and you even had a private meeting with her

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I did it on purpose

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't want to prove yourself

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're suspecting me

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What about you?

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You sent soldiers to guard

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're suspecting me too

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If I really want to guard you

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I won't allow you to find Jiu Niang

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and make trouble for the family

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We did this to protect you

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Protect me?

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Even you believe that I did it

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You'd rather believe the Qiao family

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
than me

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What about you?

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you believe me?

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why did I make you unhappy?

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you have any doubts?

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you want to go back to Bianzhou?

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How do you know?

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
As expected

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You really know

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You really know your true identity

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Since you know

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
why you didn't tell me

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We grew up together

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I take you as my brother

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So what if we're brothers?

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm the son of Chen Pang

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
of the bloodline of Bianzhou

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No matter who you are

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
you're my cousin

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Aren't you worried that I'll take the risk of your family?

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you afraid of me?

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Go

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I did the thing

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that I'm good at

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You won't trust me

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and will be wary of me in the future

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
These are all your wild guesses

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What about the Qiao family?

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why do you keep her letter?

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sister

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Although it's a small matter

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if the Marquis Wei investigates it

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
he will be in trouble

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This plan

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is not a good idea

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But I bet

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Marquis Wei will be very fond of his family

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You mean

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Will the Marquis Wei

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
investigate his brother

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
for the sake of his daughter?

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The Marquis Wei

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
is cold

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but he is a good family

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If he keeps investigating

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
he will hurt his brother

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He won't be wrong

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The Marquis sent soldiers to guard day and night

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He won't let us leave the house

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The Marquis Wei is wronged

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But now there's no way to prove it

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
According to the law of the Marquis Wei

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
we will be executed

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Mom

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't say that

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not an accident

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm old

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I won't fight

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But you are still like flowers

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mom

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you tell me

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
that you want to poison my family

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I won't believe you

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I will never believe

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
he will betray the people

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's this?

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Why did you see it from there?

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Isn't this

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the bracelet that the Marquis gave to the Great Madam?

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not the one I gave to the Great Madam

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But it looks the same

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Why is the box so familiar?

220
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't you worry about the bracelet?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You've found it

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's better to lose and gain

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's the same

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Even if our bracelet is not found

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
you don't have to be afraid

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That bracelet

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is the love between me and the Marquis

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But this bracelet

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
is the love between the Marquis and me

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Xiaotao

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You have to be careful

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm not afraid

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not afraid

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm not afraid

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yan Mo

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Help me remember this letter

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ok

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is a foreign poem

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It can be a formal poem or a family poem

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But how to use the opportunity to instigate the Marquis and the others

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Master, is it a good idea to investigate?

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Have you made up your mind?

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The female brother will be punished

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If we investigate

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
what if it's related to the male brother?

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can we kill our own brother?

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The Marquis

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is the letter of the Marquis to Yan

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Please check it

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
When did you write the letter of the Marquis?

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Take it down

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come on

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Show me

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I know the Marquis is a man

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No matter what choice I make

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I won't blame the Marquis

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Lan Jun

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you want to send this letter to Yan?

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's all nonsense

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's nonsense

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll go out

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You don't have to follow me

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Master

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The matter of the master's order has been verified

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Someone did go to Liangku

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And there is no record in the book

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
OK

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This matter

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
must be investigated

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes

276
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why was it returned?

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Can't you remember the letter now?

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We'll talk about it tomorrow

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
when we get home

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Don't panic

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The man has his own arrangement

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Six eggs

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Two eggs

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How about this?

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can go out

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Master

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Today, the total weight of 24 eggs is 21 eggs

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Before entering the warehouse

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
24 eggs are not equal in weight

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It seems that Qiao Xia did it

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It shows that the seedlings were stolen by Yu Ju

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So it's true

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's true

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Master, you're right

295
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The master is a man

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The master is a man

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The master is a man

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He would rather sacrifice himself than to do it

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He will also find out the truth

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're right

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The seedlings are different in weight

302
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It must be the man who guarded Lianggu

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's hard to say

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think we should send out the message as soon as possible

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to make a clear statement

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Zhi'er

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you want to investigate?

310
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Qiao's family is innocent

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But I believe that your cousin is innocent too

312
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We need to continue investigating

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
as we have many problems

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But before we find out

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
no one is allowed to leave Yu Jun

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's a big deal

317
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is it a six or seven-day plan?

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a six-day plan

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No matter what

320
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
no one is allowed to leave Yu Jun

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What's wrong with it?

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Qiao's family is really innocent

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What did you say?

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Are you really going to investigate it?

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Please don't worry

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I've taken care of the evidence

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You can't be blamed for the evidence

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Go

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How did you know that Nanjun would come back today?

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Nanjun told you

331
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Everyone will be relieved

332
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
when they encounter such a thing

333
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But you

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
comforted me in return

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and told me not to worry

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Nanjun protected me at my grandmother's birthday party

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That means you believe me

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So even if this matter is returned to me

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't want to make it difficult for you

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't want to make it difficult for you

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I have ordered someone to investigate this matter

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
it will take some time before I can come back

344
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OK

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Nanjun

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The stuff is ready

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's go

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wait a minute

349
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Please help me send this letter back

350
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yu Jun hasn't told Bi

351
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How did Yu Jun know that Nanjun would come back today?

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Nanjun told me

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What are Nanjun and Yu Jun fighting?

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You mean

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the one who sneaked into the warehouse was Zheng Shu?

356
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And it's multiple invitations

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's suspicious

358
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Wei Duo has already gone to the group

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Report

360
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I went to Zheng Shu to find the people

361
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I know Zheng Shu

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He was killed last night

363
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Zheng Shu is dead

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Brother Liao is more unlikely to be the murderer

365
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
There must be a bigger master behind this

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Send my order

367
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Continue to investigate this matter

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes

369
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Sir

370
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What's the matter?

371
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I have a question

372
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What's the matter?

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have a question

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I have a question for you

375
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Please go ahead

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How do you usually call your mother?

377
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I call her Madam

378
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I see

379
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Nanjun

380
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Nanjun

381
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Who is this?

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sir, it's our female army

383
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Did you hear that?

384
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The previous case of the sale of species

385
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
was not done by the female army

386
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
At least the main character is smart

387
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She didn't wrong the female army

388
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm saying how to investigate now

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We can't let our men go out of town

390
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We must catch the murderer

391
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and clear the female army

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So

393
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Maybe the main character is hiding among these people

394
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Ready to die

395
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's right

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Sister

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What should we do now?

398
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why are you panicking?

399
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If they find the murderer

400
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Do they need to be investigated here?

401
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Madam Yuluo is going out

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
General Wei Liang

403
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
My grandmother's birthday is over

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
My husband is seriously ill

405
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I need to go to the emergency room

406
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and go back to the whip

407
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Please be assured

408
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The master has ordered

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Before the case of the sale of species is cleared

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No one can leave the village

411
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I hope Madam Yuluo will cooperate

412
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Zheng Chu Yu

413
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Zheng Chu Yu

414
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why did you make the decision?

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You are going to kill your aunt

416
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Madam

417
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Madam, have you found her?

418
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I have

419
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Let her come

420
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I will ask her

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
She has been found

422
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But she can't speak

423
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
She

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's wrong?

425
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
She is dead

426
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Dead?

427
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How did she die?

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I heard that she drowned in the river when she washed her clothes

429
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
She drowned?

430
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She drowned?

431
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
No, no, no, impossible

432
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Chu Yu is very good

433
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
She can't be drowned

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Someone must have wanted to kill her

435
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Who killed her?

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You need to remember

437
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you continue to do evil things

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
One day you will kill your close ones

439
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Madam

440
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Madam, what's wrong?

441
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Madam

442
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did I kill her?

443
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's all my fault

444
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I killed her

445
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Madam

446
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You can't say that

447
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Zheng Chu Yu

448
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Whether she drowned

449
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Or she was killed

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Now it's over

451
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We need to be careful

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Besides

453
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Chu Yu is dead

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Now there is no evidence

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The South Army won't find us

456
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Who? Who?

457
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Coming

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Madam

459
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Madam, Madam Yulou is here to see you

460
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Madam

461
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I heard that my grandmother is ill

462
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's not convenient to disturb her

463
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So I came here to ask about her

464
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Normally

465
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
My grandmother loves to lose her family

466
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But the Central Army is against it

467
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
They have to find out the truth

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
What should we do?

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Madam, don't blame Marquis Wei

470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
In my opinion

471
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
He is the most difficult person now

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The case of selling the seed is very important

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Madam only saw Marquis Wei was blamed by grandmother

474
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But she didn't see many forces of Wei

475
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
For Marquis Wei

476
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If this is really done by Brother Yuan

477
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Then Marquis Wei must be careful

478
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
At this moment

479
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
How can he not suffer?

480
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yes

481
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I hope this matter will be solved

482
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I also hope this matter can be solved as soon as possible

483
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Actually

484
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It doesn't matter who is behind this

485
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
As long as it's not Brother Yuan

486
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Marquis Wei can also be relieved

487
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
My nephew

488
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How is the case of selling the seed?

489
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
If there is no clue

490
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Then let me and all the relatives go out of the city

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Let's go

492
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We have been here for a few days

493
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I have found out that someone has been in Liang's house many times

494
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
This person has served my mother for many years

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Zheng Shu

496
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Since the person has found out

497
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Bring him here

498
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
To see if it's true or not

499
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
To be tested

500
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But unfortunately

501
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Zheng Shu suddenly died last night

502
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Dead?

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That means dead

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Dead without evidence

505
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I say Zhong Lin

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
This is not your style

507
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This matter can't be fooled

508
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
If you fool it today

509
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
All the dead in the country tomorrow

510
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Take a body that can't speak

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Will be atoned for their own sins

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yes

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That's right

514
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There is a knife in my eyes

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I can prove

516
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What Zhong Lin said is true

517
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What Zhong Lin said is true

518
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Zheng Shu

519
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
He has served me all the years

520
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We two are like a daughter

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I hate my ancestors

522
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Nanrong, this bridge girl

523
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And Chu Yu should have a good relationship

524
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,180
They fought by the wheat

525
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,020
to frame the Qiao family

526
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,600
At that moment, the whole world had been turned against

527
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,620
Who knows

528
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,700
Really?

529
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,460
But my lady

530
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,160
we've talked for a long time

531
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,240
we want to ask for forgiveness

532
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,380
Don't you remember?

533
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,340
We have laws

534
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,860
General, don't be so bosom blow

535
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,660
When Chu Yu is married

536
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,920
he cannot step into the Wei Residence

537
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,040
Every time she comes, I'll send someone to take her to the side yard

538
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,240
If you don't believe me, you can go and check

539
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
I also want you to think about

540
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,360
who proposed to see the pulse

541
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,840
at the birthday banquet of my mother-in-law

542
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,400
It's exactly the same as the one in the palace

543
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,160
This is the dispute between the wife of the house and the concubine

544
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,960
It has nothing to do with the history

545
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,840
In this case, this is not a political matter

546
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
but a family matter

547
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,360
Yes

548
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,320
Since she is the mother of the husband, she can't punish her by law

549
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,600
She should be punished by the wife of the house

550
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,360
Yes

551
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,120
Yes

552
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,920
Yes

553
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,120
Master

554
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,880
This is the best way to protect the female army and the army

555
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,360
Please make your decision

556
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Open the city gate

557
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,920
Let the families leave the city and return home

558
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Okay

559
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,640
Okay

560
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,560
Okay

561
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,320
Okay

562
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,680
Send my mother to the North Court

563
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,840
and call my grandmother to come

564
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
Madam, take care

565
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,920
I only knew you were a little stupid

566
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,320
But I didn't expect you to be so kind

567
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,440
Don't be angry, aunt

568
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,680
Aunt, it doesn't matter if you believe it or not

569
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,080
I did listen to Uncle Zheng

570
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,800
and transferred the pulse

571
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,920
But I really didn't know about Uncle Zheng's pulse

572
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,440
You didn't do it

573
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,680
because you couldn't think of such a smart way

574
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,840
You are a stupid woman

575
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,240
You can't learn the idea even if you are bad

576
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,880
From now on

577
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,520
you will go to the ancestral hall and kneel and reflect

578
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,520
and read the scriptures and recite the scriptures to ease your worries

579
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,080
Madam

580
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,520
Madam

581
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,080
Zhong Lin

582
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,400
I am the female army of Bianzhou

583
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,960
But I have something to do

584
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,840
I was in your family when I was a child

585
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,120
After Luo, I have a brother

586
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,760
but I am afraid that I don't have the wealth to marry him

587
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,300
The asceticism of the deceased

588
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,760
can only be lifelong

589
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
The road to Bianzhou is long.

590
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
You'd better get on the road early.

591
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Take care, Wei Hao.

592
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Take care.

593
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,760
Your Highness,

594
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
what does Lady Yuliu mean?

595
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,360
It's the play by the poetry director.

596
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,760
It's about the childhood friends

597
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
who pretend to be strangers.

598
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,160
Sister,

599
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,360
don't be sad anymore.

600
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
How could it be?

601
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,560
In a few days,

602
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
I can go back

603
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
and be my Lady Yulou.

604
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
It's a pity.

605
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,760
Besides,

606
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
although this trip is not a city,

607
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,560
I can leave with you.

608
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
But you and I can leave together.

609
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,560
You should be happy.

610
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
Lady Yulou, please wait.

611
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,960
I hope you

612
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,360
won't come to Yujin again.

613
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Why?

614
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
You and Wei Xiang

615
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
have a relationship,

616
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,360
but you can't stand the mistake.

617
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Now you are the queen of Bianzhou,

618
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,360
and you are against the position of the Wei family.

619
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
I don't know why you did this.

620
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,760
Although I didn't say

621
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,160
you might not be happy,

622
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,360
I can't bear to see her

623
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
thinking about unhappy things.

624
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,960
So,

625
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,760
it's not convenient to see each other again.

626
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
Brother Shiyuan,

627
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
you really think you are a member of the Wei family.

628
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,760
Thank you for your concern.

629
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,760
Brother Shiyuan, you should think more about

630
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
whether you are qualified

631
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
to stay in the Wei family.

632
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,360
Brother Shiyuan,

633
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,160
I know you are here.

634
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,760
You can leave me,

635
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,560
but grandma is waiting for you in Qing'an.

636
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,960
Brother Shiyuan.

637
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,560
Young Master,

638
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,960
the Wei family is a trickster.

639
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,960
You can't be soft-hearted.

640
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,160
The young master's blood

641
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,760
is in the Bianzhou city.

642
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,160
Master is so fond of you,

643
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,160
and he is waiting for you to help him.

644
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,560
This talented young master

645
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,960
is willing to

646
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
die for a lifetime here

647
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
without being executed.

648
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,560
The Wei family knows your background

649
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,560
and is not as good as you.

650
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,560
You are not a good person.

651
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
You even risked your life

652
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,360
for the sake of your daughter.

653
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,560
Why don't you just

654
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,960
go back to Bianzhou with me?

655
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,560
Is the man

656
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,360
still worried about his cousin?

657
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
My cousin was most hurt

658
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,360
by this incident.

659
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,160
And I met my grandmother today.

660
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,760
She misses my cousin very much.

661
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
The Bianzhou city

662
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
must recognize her cousin.

663
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
But if the Wei family

664
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,760
doesn't tell her cousin the truth,

665
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,360
she might leave.

666
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
That's true.

667
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I went to see her many times,

668
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,360
but she didn't show up.

669
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,760
I don't want to make things difficult for her.

670
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Nan Jun,

671
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,160
my cousin and I

672
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,560
are in the same situation in the Wei family.

673
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,560
I'm willing to persuade my cousin for you.

674
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,760
If you trust me,

675
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
why don't you

676
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,160
tell me the truth?

677
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,360
What is this?

678
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
What is this?

679
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,760
Since you've decided to retire,

680
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,560
I know a little about water.

681
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,160
I want to help you.

682
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,560
Water is the most important thing

683
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,560
for the people and wealth.

684
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,360
I've read some information

685
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,560
and made some suggestions.

686
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
I hope I can help you.

687
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,560
Tell me.

688
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,760
Nan Jun, look at this mountain.

689
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,360
This is the northern part of Rong County.

690
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,760
I've read a lot of information

691
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
and found that it's much higher

692
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
than the new city.

693
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,560
That means if we

694
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
build from here to here,

695
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
it will cost a lot of manpower and material.

696
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,760
But

697
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,360
we can't see it from here.

698
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
What do you think these two sides are?

699
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
Both sides are mountains.

700
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,760
It means there are mountains.

701
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,960
If we take a risk,

702
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,960
we'll be in trouble.

703
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
But if we follow the mountain,

704
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,560
we'll be in trouble.

705
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,160
The mountain is high.

706
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
The mountain is high.

707
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
The mountain is high.

708
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
The mountain is high.

709
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
The mountain is high.

710
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
The mountain is high.

711
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
The mountain is high.

712
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
The mountain is high.

713
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
The mountain is high.

714
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
The mountain is high.

715
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
The mountain is high.

716
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
The mountain is high.

717
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
The mountain is high.

718
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
The mountain is high.

719
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
The mountain is high.

720
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
The mountain is high.

721
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
The mountain is high.

722
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
The mountain is high.

723
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
The mountain is high.

724
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
The mountain is high.

725
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,160
The mountain is high.

726
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
The mountain is high.

727
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,160
The mountain is high.

728
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
The mountain is high.

729
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
The mountain is high.

730
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
The mountain is high.

731
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
The mountain is high.

732
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
The mountain is high.

733
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,560
The mountain is curious.

734
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
The mountain is...

735
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
The mountain is...

736
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
the mountain...

In

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
I really have no choice.

755
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,320
I can only make this decision and come to disturb you.

756
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
I thought in the Wei family,

757
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,160
you and I were in the same situation.

758
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,320
I didn't expect that I overestimated myself.

759
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
You are your own person.

760
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
I am an outsider.

761
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Is it a family member or an outsider?

762
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Is it only based on blood?

763
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I don't know.

764
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
You know it all.

765
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
When I first came to the army,

766
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
no one recognized me as the Queen of Wei.

767
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Everyone only thought I was the enemy's grandson.

768
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
They were worried about me.

769
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
But now I am trusted by the South Army.

770
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I am loved by my grandmother.

771
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Why do you think so?

772
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Because you are the father of the Wei family.

773
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
As long as you admit that you are not the daughter of the Qiao family,

774
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Zhong Ning and grandma won't make it difficult for you.

775
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
You are wrong again.

776
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
If I betray my identity as the Qiao family,

777
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
the South Army will not treat me well

778
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
and will look down on me.

779
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
This is the Queen of Wei.

780
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
Of course, I won't do anything bad to Wei.

781
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
But I was born in Yanzhou.

782
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I will never betray my hometown.

783
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,320
I have been thinking about it for the people of Yanzhou.

784
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
I will never avoid the South Army.

785
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Our two couples are so honest with each other

786
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
that they can trust each other.

787
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
You are so beautiful.

788
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Only if I take myself as a member of the Wei family,

789
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,320
the South Army can see me as its own family.

790
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
You are also like this.

791
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
I see myself as a member of the Wei family.

792
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,320
You see me as a wife.

793
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,320
You think you are a wife and no one cares about you.

794
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,320
But grandma fell ill because of such a wife.

795
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Grandma's health is very good.

796
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Grandma heard that the South Army was going to re-investigate the case.

797
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,320
She was afraid that her cousin would be angry and fainted.

798
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
How is she now?

799
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Has she ever lost her memory?

800
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Cousin, don't worry.

801
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
But grandma can't get up from her bed.

802
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
She is still in a coma.

803
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
She is still in a coma.

804
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I guess

805
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
grandma is not willing to tell her cousin

806
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
because she is afraid of trouble.

807
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
She is afraid that her most beloved grandson

808
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
will be separated from her great-grandson

809
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
and not willing to see him.

810
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Grandma.

811
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Grandma.

812
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Grandma.

813
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Grandma.

814
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Grandma.

815
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I understand.

816
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
Then grandma is fine.

817
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
I will leave first.

818
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Shiyuan.

819
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
You don't want to

820
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
see grandma again?

821
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Grandma.

822
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I'm sorry.

823
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm sorry.

842
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I'm sorry.

844
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I'm sorry.

845
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
I'm sorry.

846
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,320
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
I'm sorry.

853
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm sorry.

855
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
I'm sorry.

861
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
I'm sorry.

862
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
I'm sorry.

863
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
I'm sorry.

865
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
I'm sorry.

866
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,320
Was it the high place they were looking for?

868
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
They were looking for where?

869
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
They looked for where,

870
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
outside with the half- garbage jacked fitting in the Theatre.

871
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
They must've been looking through the curtains.

872
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,320
It must be that Satay place.

873
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,320
Wait a minute.

874
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Come on.

875
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Don't look.

876
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I heard there was waiting.

877
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Who is this?

878
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Who is this?

879
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Didn't you buy it?

880
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,320
I will tell you the smile that bewitches you

881
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Even if the wind and snow are behind you

882
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,320
No matter how many times I have to live, it's just for this missing

883
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:34,320
I won't forget you

884
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,320
