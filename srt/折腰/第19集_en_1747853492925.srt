1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Beat spirit

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will be with you forever.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is love the only thing that can last me for the rest of my life?

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I feel more and more pained when I'm fighting?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I didn't get your ordinary care.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I didn't get your ordinary care.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I didn't get your ordinary care.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you don't get my ordinary care,

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will be afraid.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will be afraid.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will be afraid.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will be afraid.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will be afraid.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will be afraid.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,800
play Zhao Yongqi in Detective Conan when in FUKIAN

16
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,600
and also play the role of X sweets

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
if you get it right this time

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
i'm gonna forget everything

19
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,300
if you can restaurant

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,000
you can learn the life of being a self-study

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,200
framework

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,740
the people

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
My mockery

24
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,000
because when you lost all your research

25
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,800
you all thought you were brave

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,780
Mr. Gra propriety

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,860
Every time in a battle

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,700
I'll take these

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,860
castaxia

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
we would leave these weapons behind.

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,700
Although we were not born on the same day,

32
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,740
I don't think we would die on the same day.

33
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,220
But in the future,

34
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,380
even if we four leave,

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,260
and bury these weapons together,

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,700
we will always be brothers.

37
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,100
So,

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,980
I want to give this to you.

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,500
What?

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Why are you giving it to me?

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,780
This is my most precious thing.

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,900
At least I can give it to you.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,780
Then,

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,260
why do you want to give it to me?

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,180
You should take care of her for me.

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,540
Seeing her

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,620
is like seeing me.

48
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,140
Who wants to see you?

49
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,820
What?

50
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,460
What are you doing?

51
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,060
What's wrong?

52
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,740
Let's talk.

53
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,420
No, no, no.

54
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,020
Let's go home.

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
What are you doing?

56
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,700
No, no.

57
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,260
What are you doing?

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,060
No, no.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,860
Let me go.

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,500
Let me go.

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,140
You little...

62
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,340
What are you doing?

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,620
Some people say that

64
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,620
there is a deep blood feud with Yanzhou.

65
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,540
They are not on the same side.

66
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,620
But what happened?

67
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,940
They said they were willing to work for the master

68
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,460
and didn't want to marry.

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,460
But what happened?

70
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,780
Some people...

71
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,620
Enough.

72
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,420
Don't say that.

73
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,340
I didn't tell you about this.

74
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,700
It's my fault.

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,740
You can kill me or kill me.

76
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,420
I'll tell you.

77
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,540
Stop talking.

78
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,540
Well,

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,740
I'll give you all my belongings and money.

80
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,540
Is that okay?

81
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,780
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,020
We are brothers.

83
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,380
We are born to be together.

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,740
How can I take your money?

85
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,500
Besides, who cares about your silly things?

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,940
Get up.

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,060
Give me your little gold watch.

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,260
I'll help you.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,180
Enough.

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,620
Between me and Xiao Tou...

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,340
Who said that?

92
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,140
I will never marry a woman from the Qiao family.

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,620
She doesn't believe in Qiao.

94
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,300
You said you wouldn't marry a woman from Yanzhou.

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,820
I...

96
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Didn't the master marry someone else?

97
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,180
You are comparing with the master.

98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,300
The master married someone back to Yu Jun Lai.

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,580
You want to marry yourself to Tong Jun.

100
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,380
Can you do that?

101
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
Good.

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,780
So you want to do the training.

103
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,860
What are you doing?

104
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,580
What are you doing?

105
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,700
No.

106
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,540
Be gentle.

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,700
Nan Jun.

108
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,500
Ning Jun.

109
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,820
Isn't what you are holding

110
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,420
the thing I gave Wei Lian?

111
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Why is it with you?

112
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,500
No.

113
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,060
Nan Jun is wrong.

114
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,820
Your hand...

115
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,620
Ning Jun.

116
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,860
Mr. Saifu is closing the door.

117
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,660
So you knew

118
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,820
Wei Lian likes Xiao Tao.

119
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,820
Just a little bit earlier than Nan Jun.

120
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,420
I mean...

121
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,420
Why would Wei Lian not

122
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,660
marry the daughter of the master?

123
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,860
What do you think?

124
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,940
What do I think?

125
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,860
If Wei Lian wants to marry Xiao Tao,

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,540
can you agree?

127
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,620
Xiao Tao is from the Qiao family.

128
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,340
Why can't I agree?

129
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,460
No matter who she is,

130
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,300
she is from the Wei family.

131
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,060
You are.

132
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Nan Jun.

133
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,300
What?

134
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
Am I wrong?

135
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,540
We were suspecting each other.

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,660
Now,

137
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,180
you are helping me to marry her.

138
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,860
Let me go!

139
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,660
Pu Xiaohui!

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,100
Stir-fried mushrooms are ready.

141
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,540
Baked meat!

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,940
Oui Lian ordered them.

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,460
No awful food

144
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,020
could match my fattness.

145
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,460
I can't eat it.

146
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,940
We just eat it.

147
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,100
Unrusual, right?

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,500
Fattish?

149
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,660
We just eat it.

150
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,500
P configurations.

151
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,420
I can eat something completely.

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,660
Let's go.

153
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,140
We should change it.

154
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,620
We should make the Mar sings too.

155
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,380
Yeah.

156
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,940
I'll take you to the door of the wrong side

157
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,220
and embrace the sunset

158
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,820
Madam, please

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,540
What kind of jewelry do you want to choose today?

160
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,020
You may not know

161
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,340
The jewelry store is full of them

162
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,940
Jade hairpin

163
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,540
White pearl hairpin

164
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,180
Crispy hairpin

165
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,140
This time

166
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,020
Take care of your mother

167
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,140
and keep your eyes on her

168
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,260
You like these things?

169
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,740
No woman doesn't like jewelry

170
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm not afraid of anything

171
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,540
This and this

172
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,420
Do you like it?

173
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,300
So Nanjun knows my hobby

174
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,900
I don't understand these

175
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,700
This was chosen by Wei Xu

176
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,220
I thought you weren't that stubborn

177
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,420
Why did the female army come back so soon?

178
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,380
Did Nanjun make the female army angry again?

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,900
I'm telling you

180
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,300
Don't talk to Wei Jialang again

181
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,500
What do you mean?

182
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,460
Only know how to fight

183
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,780
and not know how to fight

184
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm telling you

185
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,460
Don't talk to Wei Jialang again

186
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,740
What do you mean?

187
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,700
Only know how to fight

188
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,100
and not know how to fight

189
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,020
Hmm

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,860
Where are my Garden of Youth Whenever I Come

191
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,300
What do you mean?

192
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,220
Forget it

193
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,340
Wei Jialang?

194
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,980
I can't understand

195
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,500
According toèsame

196
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,980
I've seen according to Wei Jialang

197
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
I've heard from outside

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,580
to his Miss

199
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,180
Eunuch Yuan

200
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,220
why

201
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,260
Wei Jialang

202
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,140
Didn't receive rewards for his grandfather

203
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,460
He didn't accept any System of War

204
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,860
I'm not sure.

205
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,100
He's thoughtful.

206
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,380
Yujuan, be careful.

207
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,420
Don't drop it.

208
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,700
He gave it to you.

209
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,300
I dare not drop it.

210
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,980
You promise.

211
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,780
No.

212
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,620
It's mainly from Nanjun.

213
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,780
I dare not drop it.

214
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,540
Nanjun?

215
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,300
Wei Liang said

216
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,660
each of them

217
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,020
has a small weapon.

218
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
Wei Qu is a pair of long and short swords.

219
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,660
Wei Xiao is a small bow.

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,500
Wei Duo is a small sword.

221
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,740
Nanjun made it

222
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,180
according to everyone's preference.

223
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,060
So it's not that Wei Jialang

224
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,140
doesn't know how to deliver things.

225
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,580
It's not that Nanjun doesn't know how to deliver things.

226
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,700
It's Nanjun who doesn't know how to deliver things.

227
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,460
I have no problem with it.

228
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,420
Nanjun...

229
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,820
Nanjun.

230
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,700
Wait for me.

231
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,460
I'm walking so fast.

232
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,740
Come on.

233
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,540
Nanjun has been a soldier for many years.

234
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,860
He walks very fast.

235
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,260
I have to walk faster

236
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,140
to catch up.

237
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,460
You don't have to.

238
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:10,740
These are all your favorite

239
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,780
combat weapons.

240
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,500
I knew it.

241
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,460
You must like combat weapons too.

242
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,860
We'll go back to the army tomorrow morning.

243
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,780
You should rest for a while.

244
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,260
I have to tell you something

245
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,860
before you go to bed.

246
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,980
I'll go now.

247
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,220
All these

248
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,820
were chosen for grandparents.

249
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,900
Then I'll

250
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,980
pick this for you.

251
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,740
Your advice is Sun Xiao's latest?

252
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:19,720
Works as a

253
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,980
Name simply.

254
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
But I have to work harder.

255
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,700
But you said

256
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,780
you would go back to Yujin tomorrow.

257
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,300
Why?

258
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,900
Doesn't Yujin want to go back?

259
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,500
Not that.

260
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,860
I don't want to leave halfway.

261
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,980
Go find Yang Feng.

262
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,060
Yes.

263
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,980
This one.

264
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,060
Sir,

265
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,060
such a dress should be there.

266
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,660
It's better to wear it when you go out.

267
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,700
Pill Galaxy.

268
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,780
What are you thinking?

269
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:48,160
驯

270
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,740
It looks like Because I only wanna be your superior,

271
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,980
and leave no guest behind.

272
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:20,120
Here,

273
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,060
Yue Liao.

274
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,980
Come.

275
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,460
Master.

276
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,900
Tell me.

277
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
Why did you give the gold watch

278
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,540
to someone else?

279
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,820
Master.

280
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,420
You don't agree to marry my daughter

281
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,940
because you like Xiaotao.

282
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,500
Why didn't you tell me?

283
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,620
I was afraid you wouldn't agree.

284
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
I was afraid you'd like it if I didn't.

285
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,540
I really can't control myself.

286
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,260
When we took over Yun Zhongjun five years ago,

287
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,060
you were burned to death

288
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,220
for the sake of the operation.

289
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,540
Now you're telling me you can't control yourself.

290
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,780
I really can't control myself.

291
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
Every time I was working in the office,

292
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,940
I was thinking about him all the time.

293
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,020
What's so fun and delicious?

294
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,860
I thought of him at first sight.

295
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,860
When he was angry,

296
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,420
I couldn't sleep all night.

297
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,420
I was happy when he was happy.

298
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,620
I was happy when he was sad.

299
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,980
I was sad when I was sad too.

300
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,580
I was sad when I was sad too.

301
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,420
I really can't control myself.

302
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,900
It's said that

303
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,820
heroes are sadder than beauties.

304
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,740
So you're sad too.

305
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,220
Master.

306
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,820
Love is complicated.

307
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,140
You don't like someone.

308
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,260
You don't understand.

309
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,580
Master.

310
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
Love is complicated.

311
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,180
Yes.

312
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,500
You're right. I don't understand.

313
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
We didn't leave.

314
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,740
Where's Junsheng?

315
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,860
I'll tell him now.

316
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,140
I'm sure his daughter's birthday is on me.

317
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,940
Don't worry.

318
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,420
No, no, no.

319
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,140
Master, you're wrong.

320
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,860
You're wrong.

321
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,300
You're wrong.

322
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,540
Nanjun.

323
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,340
Nanjun.

324
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,580
Since you've packed up,

325
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,620
let's go.

326
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,060
Everyone.

327
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,380
Please take care of the rest of the Yongning Qu's.

328
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,780
We'll do our best.

329
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,620
Let's go.

330
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,460
Oh no.

331
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,020
Oh no.

332
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,500
This is bad.

333
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,260
What's wrong?

334
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,060
What's wrong?

335
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,860
What's wrong?

336
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,580
What's wrong?

337
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,380
What's wrong?

338
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,180
What's wrong?

339
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,980
What's wrong?

340
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,700
What's wrong?

341
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,340
What's wrong?

342
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,140
What's wrong?

343
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,740
Just tell me what's wrong.

344
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,700
What's wrong?

345
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:37,180
I have a book of water

346
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,540
You can remember to bring yourself

347
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,500
It's not easy.

348
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,260
I shouldn't have bothered you.

349
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,300
But this book is related to the progress of the project.

350
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,460
So, please go there for me.

351
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,700
You're just pretending.

352
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,180
If you really want to help us,

353
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,860
how can you forget this?

354
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,580
Shut up.

355
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
Are you serious?

356
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,940
Marquis Wei.

357
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,140
It's okay.

358
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,820
It's not a big deal.

359
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,180
I'll send someone to send someone to get you a book.

360
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,020
How about Lanjun take us to go together?

361
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,540
That's the best.

362
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,900
Marquis Wei can handle this matter himself.

363
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,500
There will be no mistake.

364
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,140
Wait.

365
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,580
Marquis Wei is willing to go to Panye for you.

366
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,780
Just for a book?

367
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,060
Don't worry.

368
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,660
The process of Panye

369
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,260
goes along the water.

370
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,340
First, we can go to see

371
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,620
the progress of the project.

372
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,540
Second, we can go there alone.

373
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,940
And we can help the county magistrate get the crystal back.

374
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,540
It's a one-off.

375
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,220
Just as the queen said,

376
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,220
I dare to ask Marquis Wei to go there.

377
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,860
What do you think, Lanjun?

378
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,860
We did a lot of things in Panye last time.

379
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,420
I want to go back and have a look.

380
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay.

381
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,420
Do as you want.

382
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,580
Let's go to Panye.

383
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,500
Thank you, Marquis Wei.

384
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,580
Let's go.

385
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,660
Let's go.

386
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,820
Get in the car first.

387
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,060
Yijuan, did you see that?

388
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,500
Just now, Lanjun looked at you.

389
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,780
His eyes were straight.

390
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,700
See you.

391
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,000
Madam.

392
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,840
Madam.

393
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,440
Madam.

394
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,080
Madam.

395
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,480
Madam.

396
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,440
Yuchi.

397
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,640
Yuchi.

398
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
Can you hear me?

399
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Xing, go find the doctor.

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,440
Yes.

401
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,480
Are you going to give my family some plum?

402
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,720
General asked me where I got plum two days ago.

403
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,200
I told him that I had it.

404
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
I didn't expect to fall at the gate.

405
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,640
Who knew it would fall?

406
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,520
It's a fall.

407
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,320
It's obviously a fall of the air.

408
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
It must be Xue Tai.

409
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,000
The mountain is at the border of the Boya.

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,960
Xue Tai is always there.

411
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
When General Lai wakes up, he'll be there.

412
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,560
Hurry, take him in.

413
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,680
Yes, hurry.

414
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,040
You're awake.

415
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,280
Fan.

416
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,040
Don't move.

417
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,600
Don't move.

418
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
Fan, I'm getting up.

419
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Does your wound still hurt?

420
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,800
Is the plum delicious?

421
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
It's okay if it's not.

422
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,640
Next time, I'll get you another tree.

423
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
I haven't eaten yet.

424
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,360
Then try it.

425
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,200
Try it.

426
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,400
Try it.

427
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Is it not delicious?

428
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,480
If it's not delicious,

429
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
then I won't eat it.

430
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,560
Delicious?

431
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,240
Delicious.

432
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,480
I don't want to eat plum anymore.

433
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,680
I just want to live a good life with you.

434
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,440
Fan.

435
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,400
Aren't we living a good life?

436
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,160
This time, it's just an accident.

437
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I promise you.

438
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,400
I'll be careful in the future.

439
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
I won't be found by Xue Tai again.

440
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
If you were an ordinary citizen,

441
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,760
you wouldn't have to pay attention to Xue Tai.

442
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,160
But you're the commander of the State of Boya.

443
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,200
That's why you're in danger.

444
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,320
Let's leave, Yizhi.

445
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,400
Fan.

446
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,720
I don't want to be the commander of the State of Boya.

447
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,320
I just want to give you a stable place

448
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,240
in this chaotic world.

449
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,600
A happy life.

450
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,840
A place where others are,

451
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,320
is never as safe as your own.

452
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,640
Moreover,

453
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,520
the most important thing is

454
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,080
I want to get the approval of the female king

455
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,080
and your family.

456
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
I think that's how you'll be happy.

457
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,600
Fine.

459
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
Since there's a conflict,

460
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,280
let them not interfere.

461
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
If you can get the approval of the Qiao family and Wei family,

462
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
and make an announcement that you're the son-in-law of the Qiao family

463
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,960
and the father-in-law of the Marquis Wei,

464
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,480
they won't interfere.

465
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,840
Fine.

466
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,440
Don't cry.

467
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,760
Nan Jun.

468
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
Don't be so formal.

469
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm used to eating with the soldiers.

470
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
I just want to share my thoughts with you.

471
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
We're just eating.

472
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,560
You want this?

473
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,360
Master.

474
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
The road ahead is blocked.

475
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,600
Please make a decision.

476
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,840
Okay, I'll go and have a look.

477
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,160
You can use it yourself.

478
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
It's too cold outside.

479
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
Get in the car and take it.

480
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
Tao, I'll get in the car with you.

481
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,600
You like this cake?

482
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,920
Eat more.

483
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,000
Are you moving to the mansion first?

484
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
Okay, let's go.

485
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,720
Tao.

486
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,480
Take this.

487
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,560
But eat it first.

488
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,160
If Tao can't avoid this cake,

489
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
there'll be a seperation,

490
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,800
You eat first.

491
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,600
Don't wait for me.

492
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,560
Who's waiting for you?

493
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,720
Why are you holding this for me?

494
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
Master said you wanted to eat it.

495
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,680
You and him,

496
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,120
what can you learn?

497
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
You don't understand anything.

498
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,600
What's wrong?

499
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,960
Did I annoy you again?

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,760
Go, go, go.

501
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,440
You didn't annoy me.

502
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
You offended the Queen, didn't you know?

503
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,440
You can't tell at all.

504
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,560
The Queen wants to be closer to the King.

505
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
The road is so big.

506
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,800
Why do you have to call the King away at this time?

507
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,080
I don't care.

508
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
You're responsible for your own trouble.

509
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Fine.

510
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
I'll take care of it.

511
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
You'll take care of it.

512
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,760
I'm leaving.

513
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,280
Come back.

514
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,720
It's on you,

515
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,240
not on us.

516
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,880
You're so fast.

517
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,240
You can handle it yourself.

518
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,560
Go.

519
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,920
Come back.

520
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
Master's stupid brain.

521
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
You want him to understand the Queen's mind.

522
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
What do you think?

523
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,240
Are we brothers?

524
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
Are we brothers?

525
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,440
Did we say

526
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,680
we have both good and bad.

527
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
What happened to him?

528
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,920
He's scared.

529
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not about life and death.

530
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
You have your own way.

531
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:27,760
Go.

532
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,240
Go.

533
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,200
Come back.

534
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,400
One month off.

535
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
Three months is enough.

536
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Kids don't listen to this kind of things.

537
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Go.

538
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,640
Go play on the road.

539
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,240
Don't move.

540
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,040
Come here.

541
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,160
Go.

542
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,040
I can't hear you

543
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,160
saying such bad things.

544
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
When I went to the bar,

545
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,400
there were always those drunkards

546
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,720
who were jealous of me.

547
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
There's a gap between

548
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,920
the female soldiers and the main workers.

549
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,560
You

550
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,280
are jealous of the main workers?

551
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Do you want me to die?

552
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
What do you mean?

553
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
I'll tell you the truth.

554
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm in love with her.

555
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,920
The best way to make a person

556
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,840
realize his feelings

557
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,120
is to make him lose his feelings first.

558
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,400
Think about it.

559
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,000
If Xiao Tao disappears now,

560
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,120
what will you feel?

561
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,960
Will you be in a hurry to get her?

562
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
You are so sweet.

563
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,400
Do you have any orders?

564
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,960
The main worker only asked me

565
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
to ask you to wait here.

566
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,760
We'll protect you.

567
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,480
Please.

568
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,280
Wait here.

569
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,440
Wait.

570
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,080
Wait.

571
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,000
Wait.

572
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,520
Master.

573
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,560
Master.

574
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,080
The female soldiers...

575
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,760
The female soldiers...

576
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
What's wrong with the female soldiers?

577
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,240
The female soldiers said

578
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
they were sitting on the carriage for too long.

579
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,880
They were bored.

580
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
They insisted on going out.

581
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,920
Can someone guard them?

582
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,160
Wei Liang and Wei Duo are both here.

583
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
They are all here.

584
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
They are all here.

585
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,520
They are all here.

586
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
They are all here.

587
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,240
That's fine.

588
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,680
The female soldiers haven't returned for a long time.

589
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
I guess they are bored

590
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
on the carriage.

591
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,560
And the march is really boring.

592
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
Now that the food is ready,

593
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,280
the big event is over.

594
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,640
Let him play for a while.

595
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
Why are you back?

596
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,080
Didn't I ask you to guard the female soldiers?

597
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,280
Master.

598
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
The female soldiers said they wanted to get some water.

599
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
They asked me to ask if they wanted to get water from the river.

600
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,280
You are so muddled.

601
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,560
It's a wild place.

602
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,240
How can you keep the female soldiers alone?

603
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,680
Wei Duo.

604
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,400
Wei Duo?

605
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,840
Wei Duo is not as tall as Tao Zi.

606
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,880
Tell me about Wei Duo.

607
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,960
It's a complicated place.

608
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,000
It's a wild place.

609
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
If the beasts come out,

610
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
the female soldiers will be in danger.

611
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
They will be in danger.

612
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
If they encounter bandits,

613
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,200
and they are afraid of the beauty of the female soldiers,

614
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
or if they encounter refugees,

615
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
they will be in danger.

616
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,760
The hungry women in the belly will be treated as food.

617
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
They will be like a woman in the belly.

618
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,400
Haven't you heard of this kind of story?

619
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,640
If there is something wrong with the female soldiers,

620
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,360
you will be punished.

621
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
You will be punished.

622
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,360
Master.

623
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,480
I will teach her a lesson for you.

624
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,520
Master.

625
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,920
What's wrong with you today?

626
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
You just went for a walk.

627
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
Wei Duo is following us.

628
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
I mainly see the sun.

629
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
The female soldiers...

630
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Okay.

631
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,040
I will go to welcome her.

632
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
Master, please.

633
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,280
You were so scary just now.

634
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm serious.

635
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,200
Do you know that you are anxious?

636
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,640
You can't always

637
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
come to see me.

638
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,200
The female soldiers won't really be in danger.

639
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,560
Wei Duo is here.

640
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,600
That's right.

641
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
What are you two arguing about?

642
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,200
Wei Duo.

643
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,440
Where are the female soldiers?

644
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,320
Where are the female soldiers?

645
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,640
Female soldiers?

646
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
Aren't they with you?

647
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh, no.

648
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,240
I didn't clean my ears.

649
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,280
Wei Duo.

650
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,640
Yes.

651
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,080
Where are the female soldiers?

652
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,080
Oh, no.

653
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
Where are the female soldiers?

654
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
Find them!

655
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,160
Yes.

656
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,840
This way!

657
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,560
Stop!

658
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,760
Are you okay, Master?

659
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,320
Take them down!

660
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,960
Yes.

661
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
Master, please spare us!

662
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Master, please spare us!

663
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
Master, please spare us!

664
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,480
Xiao De, are you okay?

665
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Who are you taking?

666
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,520
Who are you taking?

667
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,080
What's wrong?

668
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,560
Master.

669
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm fine.

670
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
You're useful.

671
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,280
Take these people

672
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,480
to see the doctor.

673
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,440
Some of them are sick.

674
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
How did you know I was here?

675
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,880
Are you okay?

676
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,760
I'm fine.

677
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
I saw these refugees

678
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
wandering in the woods.

679
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,760
They were walking around

680
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,080
when they came out to find food with their fellow villagers.

681
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,040
It was late at night.

682
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,760
I asked the guards to lead us to find the way.

683
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,560
Then we arrived here.

684
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,720
Didn't you get caught by them?

685
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,240
No.

686
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's go.

687
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,240
Go.

688
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,080
Where are you from?

689
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,760
Where are you going?

690
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,920
General,

691
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,760
we're from Yanzhou.

692
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,400
Because the rain water this year

693
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,920
is less than last year.

694
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,520
In order to fight against the flood,

695
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,200
Yanzhou and Yaozhou

696
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,720
fought tirelessly.

697
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,800
Hundreds of people in the village

698
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
were forced to leave home.

699
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,680
All the way here,

700
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,240
only these people are left.

701
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,240
General.

702
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,800
Yanzhou is thousands of miles away from here.

703
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,320
You people

704
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,680
just walked out like this.

705
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
There's no other way.

706
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,360
We went to Liangya.

707
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
He didn't take us.

708
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,200
We went to Yanzhou.

709
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,680
Yanzhou didn't take us either.

710
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, General.

711
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
We really couldn't walk.

712
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
Even if we found a sheltered place

713
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,960
to hide from the rain,

714
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,480
we couldn't go there.

715
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,680
We could only go there

716
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,200
when the weather gets better.

717
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
Please forgive us.

718
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,960
Don't drive us away.

719
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
Yes, General.

720
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,760
Don't drive us away.

721
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
We didn't mean to drive you away.

722
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,680
The soil here

723
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,520
is really not a good place.

724
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
Where are we going?

725
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,800
General.

726
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,760
General.

727
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
General.

728
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,920
General.

729
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,880
Please save us, General.

730
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,200
Please save us.

731
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,160
General.

732
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
Please save us.

733
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,800
Save us.

734
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
General, please save us.

735
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
There's a place 20 miles north of here.

736
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,600
It's near the Panyi,

737
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
the new capital of the East Street.

738
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,560
It's suitable for building houses.

739
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,520
And it's near the Yongning District.

740
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,800
It's also convenient to water the fields.

741
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,120
You can open up a big field there

742
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
and cultivate your life.

743
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,760
But from today on,

744
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,680
you have to promise to follow the law of the country

745
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,880
and not offend the people.

746
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,240
The Wey Kingdom will take you in.

747
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
You can drink the water of the Wey Kingdom,

748
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,600
eat the rice of the Wey Kingdom,

749
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,120
and be with ordinary people.

750
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,320
Thank you, General.

751
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
Thank you.

752
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,240
Thank you.

753
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
But when we passed the Panyi County,

754
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
the county magistrate happened to be out on business.

755
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Without the county magistrate's approval,

756
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,760
we wouldn't dare to stop outside the city.

757
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,640
It's not easy to build houses.

758
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
The one in front of you

759
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,400
is not an ordinary general.

760
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
He's the master of the Wey Kingdom.

761
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,120
They're all so kind.

762
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,920
Marquis.

763
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
Thank you, Marquis.

764
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
Congratulations.

765
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
Congratulations.

766
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
Congratulations.

767
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,080
Congratulations.

768
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,280
Congratulations, Marquis.

769
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,720
You're awake, Dad.

770
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
Come back to the camp with us.

771
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,640
Eat some dry grains with the wind.

772
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,120
Let's set out to Panyi County tomorrow.

773
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,880
Thank you.

774
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,680
Thank you.

775
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
Congratulations, Marquis.

776
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,240
Congratulations.

777
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,480
Where are you going?

778
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,520
There's no water.

779
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,960
I'll get some water.

780
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,480
No need.

781
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,160
Guards.

782
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,680
Yes.

783
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Get some water.

784
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,600
Yes.

785
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,640
Drink it.

786
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,760
Yes.

787
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,120
Where are you going?

788
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
It's cold at night.

789
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,640
I'll get some clothes from the carriage.

790
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,400
No need.

791
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,720
Here, cover it.

792
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,680
You can wear it.

793
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,480
It's okay. Cover it.

794
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,440
Here, cover it.

795
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,840
Here.

796
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,600
Change clothes.

797
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,280
No.

798
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,360
Sit down.

799
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,800
But what's wrong with you today?

800
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,080
You're always against me.

801
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,840
I don't care. I'm going to change now.

802
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,520
No.

803
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,640
Listen.

804
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
From today on,

805
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,960
you must tell me where you want to go.

806
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,960
Don't make me worry like today.

807
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,760
Guards.

808
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,880
Guards, it's okay.

809
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,160
Chunniang did make me worried today.

810
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
She has been nagging me for a long time.

811
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
The one who worries you the most today

812
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
is not Chunniang.

813
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,960
The one who worries you the most today

814
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,080
is not Chunniang.

815
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,240
The one who worries you the most today

816
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,360
is not Chunniang.

817
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,960
The one who worries you the most today

818
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,240
is not Chunniang.

819
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,000
Good.

820
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,720
Good job.

821
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
The eldest daughter of Yao family

822
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,680
is very beautiful,

823
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
but she's old now.

824
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,560
It's not convenient to write to the lord.

825
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,360
Yes.

826
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,600
Although the eldest daughter of the Li family

827
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,080
is good at singing and dancing,

828
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,360
she's a famous

829
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
stupid mouth and a snake.

830
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,440
Yes.

831
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,680
Lord.

832
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,600
What do you think of the daughter of Xu Gong?

833
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,440
This daughter is beautiful

834
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,840
and has a clear smile.

835
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,200
And the daughter of the Lv family

836
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,040
is good at playing the zither and painting.

837
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,240
She's famous all over the country.

838
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,640
If you can find this daughter,

839
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,520
it's a great gift.

840
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,960
It's not easy to find this daughter.

841
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Isn't it a little hard?

842
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Lord.

843
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
Lord, this is for the country.

844
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,120
If you have no children,

845
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,520
you can find a woman who is not a woman

846
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,480
and be a concubine.

847
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,880
So what?

848
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
What concubine?

849
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,120
Brother.

850
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,000
I'll order someone to find a beautiful girl

851
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,640
and make a zither for you.

852
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,040
I'll ask someone to find a beautiful girl

853
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,240
and make a zither for you.

854
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,800
What concubine?

855
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm old.

856
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,600
I...

857
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,440
I want to find a good-aged woman

858
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,360
to raise her

859
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,160
and marry her to the Marquis of the World.

860
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,440
You married two daughters

861
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,040
and you've tasted the sweetness?

862
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,320
I'm doing this for the country.

863
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
In the world,

864
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,040
there's no such thing as the country.

865
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,800
Don't talk nonsense.

866
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,640
Sister-in-law.

867
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,840
Brother, you've gone too far.

868
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,160
You asked A-Ci and Manman to get married.

869
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,280
All these years,

870
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,800
you've been the only one who's been over the edge.

871
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,600
You've raised these three children.

872
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,720
Even your father

873
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,440
respects you.

874
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,800
How could you be so cold to him?

875
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,080
I've said it.

876
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,160
It's not about the concubine.

877
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,760
I didn't say that.

878
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,880
It's just that...

879
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,640
It's just that...

880
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,200
It's just that...

881
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,000
It's just that...

882
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's just that...

883
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,760
It's just that...

884
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
It's just that...

885
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,120
It's just that he said it.

886
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Brother.

887
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm doing this for our family

888
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,120
and for the country.

889
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,280
Since Manman got married to Wei,

890
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,880
the relationship between the two families has improved significantly.

891
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,480
It's clear that the marriage is going well.

892
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,960
Brother.

893
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,640
Now,

894
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,040
Liangya, Zhongzhou, and Juejun

895
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
are all expanding.

896
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,360
The world is in chaos.

897
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,480
I can't wait for the Qiao family

898
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,720
to have more daughters.

899
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,200
You're doing this?

900
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,560
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

901
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,840
If I, Yanzhou,

902
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,440
please other people with my daughter,

903
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,160
it'll be a shame for me.

904
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,800
If I really do this,

905
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,640
how can I have the face

906
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,440
to do this to the young master of Yanzhou?

907
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,360
Brother.

908
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,000
You're not going to die here.

909
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,720
But you'll be bewitched by this bitch.

910
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,120
Brother.

911
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,920
I'll kick you out of the house.

912
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,960
Master.

913
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,400
Master.

914
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,920
I...

915
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,280
I...

916
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,080
Master.

917
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Mr. Zhang is a man of no value.

918
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,800
You'll have to rely on him in the future.

919
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,000
He's a man of no value.

920
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,800
Master.

921
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,040
Since you don't believe me,

922
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,920
I'll go back to clean up.

923
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,360
I'm going to go back to my hometown.

924
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,200
You don't have to go.

925
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,360
I'll go back to clean up now.

926
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Leave this dirty place.

927
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
What are you talking about?

928
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,240
Zi.

929
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,720
Master.

930
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,040
Enough, sir.

931
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,400
Don't make trouble.

932
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,240
I...

933
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,680
Don't be afraid.

934
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,600
Tell me if you want to live.

935
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,280
Tell me if you want to die,

936
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,800
but they'll kill you,

937
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,640
or you'll never say goodbye to me.

938
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,880
I've needed so much time to approach you.

939
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,320
Just ignore my family.

940
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,240
And live the dream.

941
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,320
Yes.

942
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:53,320
white as an enjoyed dark good wine, faithless lovers Hooking premises with my finger.

943
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,320
I'm willing to be the smile that makes you smile

944
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,320
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

945
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,320
No matter how much I don't want to be, I only think about you

946
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I won't forget you in this life

947
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:55,320
I'm willing to cross the sea of mountains to follow your wind

948
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,320
Waiting for the white hand to enter the bow

949
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Jiangnan words are not落在你眉睫

00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,320
The heart is sad and the tears flow

951
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,320
I'm willing to be the smile that makes you smile

952
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

953
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,320
No matter how much I don't want to be, I only think about you

954
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:28,320
I won't forget you in this life

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:47,320
