00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now the Eastern window is in danger.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Grandma still refuses to leave the legal books.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Where is the dignity of the South Army?

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everyone says that grandma loves her son.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But did grandma have a South Army in her heart?

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That was for the legal books.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She was sitting on the box and feeding the legal books.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She didn't even give the South Army medicine.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She was feeding the legal books.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But the South Army is the great country's master.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The marriage should be in the power of the army.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But because of the first sword,

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
grandma has been making excuses.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe grandma doesn't want the South Army to be the great country's master.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let go!

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Grandma

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Grandma is worried that the legal books will be left behind.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She knows that the South Army will leave home because of the shame.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But she didn't do anything wrong.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She is a great country's great man.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
She has to take care of the marriage.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Grandma has been concerned about her.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How much she has to go through and how much she has to suffer.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Even the shoes for the South Army are small.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I saw that the legal books were in good condition.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It was all arranged by grandma.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I understand that grandma didn't want to be the first.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She just didn't want to put the blame on the South Army.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In this case,

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will be responsible for the South Army's food and drink from now on.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Enough!

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How do you know my feelings for Zhong Lin?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Get out!

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's have a good rest.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go and find something with a fragrance.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We just came back from the execution ground.

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There is a smell of blood on the body.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Some people don't like to smell.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't let him find trouble.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The female army doesn't have to rush.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The South Army doesn't know when they will come back.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's okay.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the emergency needle.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to hurry to give him the money before he leaves tomorrow.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The emergency needle is missing.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let the female army sew it.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The female army doesn't care about the momentary

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have promised grandma to treat him sincerely.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Of course I can't be lazy.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How about this?

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You go to prepare the meal first.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If the South Army doesn't come back today,

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you can pick some things that he likes.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Send it to him.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tell him to take care of his body.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, female army.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll go to the toilet.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What is this?

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a rose.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If the South Army doesn't think it's right.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then you can change it.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,280
Although the rose is with thorns,

72
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,800
it's still fragrant.

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,120
Nan Jun is back?

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
I asked someone to prepare dinner.

75
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you want to eat together?

76
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
You arrange it.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
I was just shocked that day.

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm not afraid of Nan Jun.

81
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
Why do you tell me this?

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
I don't care.

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,520
I know Nan Jun's character.

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
Even at the most critical moment,

85
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
he didn't force me.

86
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,400
But it wasn't Nan Jun's fault that day.

87
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
Why did Nan Jun blame himself?

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
I didn't blame myself.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,880
It's true that

90
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,960
it's important for the two brothers to get together.

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
But when the matters related to the construction of the palace

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,920
were discussed last time,

93
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,800
Nan Jun has made it clear.

94
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,800
This time, it's just a process.

95
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
Nan Jun is a noble person.

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
Usually...

97
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
I know you can talk back.

98
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's eat first.

99
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
What's this?

100
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,920
I saw Nan Jun's belt was worn out.

101
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,720
So...

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
Did you embroider it yourself?

103
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
It's too short.

104
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,880
It's not good.

105
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,920
It's not good.

106
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,520
Look at the mandarin ducks.

107
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
They look like two ducks.

108
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
It's not that bad.

109
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
Besides, I didn't embroider the mandarin ducks.

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,520
I embroidered the phoenix birds.

111
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,520
The phoenix birds and mandarin ducks are so similar.

112
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,040
So you're not good at embroidery.

113
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Who can tell that they're phoenix birds?

114
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,960
When you're at home and have nothing to do,

115
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
you'll have a lot of needlework.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm not good at it.

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm not good at it.

118
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not good at it.

119
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
You're getting better at it.

120
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,000
Nan Jun is right.

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
If you don't mind,

122
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
try the mandarin ducks first.

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,920
It's just a belt.

124
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,840
There's nothing to try.

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
Try it later.

126
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's eat.

127
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,380
larda

128
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,560
Mr. Du calls me to go out

129
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,120
to console him when he's when he's concerned.

130
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
But I really can't

131
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,400
drink the tea today.

132
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
You can stop drinking the tea.

133
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
But you have to ask the military

134
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,360
to help me.

135
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,440
You want to ask the female king.

136
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,680
How do you know?

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,000
The female king also asked me a few days ago.

138
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
Then how did you tell him?

139
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,400
You and the female king are husband and wife.

140
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,760
That's the true love.

141
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,280
We are in love.

142
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,600
Why do we have to calculate each other?

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,880
From now on,

144
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,320
I won't hurt her again.

145
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,840
But Qiao Zu is the most unforgivable.

146
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,720
Yes, put it there.

147
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,920
Put it back there. Hurry up.

148
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,960
Put it there.

149
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,640
Hurry up.

150
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,800
Uncle,

151
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,080
hurry up and finish it.

152
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,400
Hurry up.

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,080
Hurry up.

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,600
What does this mean?

155
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
Master, the people are here to see you off.

156
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,840
See me off?

157
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
You can go there yourself

158
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
for the marriage.

159
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,640
Then why don't you do it yourself?

160
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Let the people know

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
that you love your people like your own son.

162
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,480
When will you leave?

163
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,080
We'll see you off.

164
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,000
You all want me to leave like this?

165
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,040
Yes.

166
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
It's a long way.

167
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Let me see you off.

168
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,280
The wine is here.

169
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,960
The wine is here.

170
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,960
The wine is here, Master.

171
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,080
The wine is here too.

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
Since you're so happy,

173
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,400
how about this?

174
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,640
You go and manage it yourself.

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,160
Master, I've never been happy.

176
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
You can take this opportunity

177
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,640
to go out and experience it.

178
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
Master, I'm still young.

179
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,200
I haven't done my job alone.

180
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm still young.

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Once you have the strength,

182
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
you'll grow up.

183
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,040
It's settled.

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,320
Yes.

185
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,960
Don't think about going.

186
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
We're very mature.

187
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,080
Your Majesty,

188
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,040
these are the belt and snacks

189
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,920
from the female army.

190
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,440
I asked you to eat them on the way.

191
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,240
Take the belt.

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
You can take this

193
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,920
and eat it on the way.

194
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
Master, the female army sent these for you.

195
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
Why don't you eat with me?

196
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Go ahead.

197
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,280
I'll eat the meat when I get home.

198
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Let's go.

199
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
Master asked you to go.

200
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,000
You just go.

201
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,240
This is the respect and love

202
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,200
of Master to you.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,520
Go ahead.

204
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,760
Let me come back.

205
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,760
Do your job well.

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
I happen to be hungry.

207
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,400
Let's eat together.

208
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,160
Then Chunniang,

209
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
please give me more meat.

210
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes.

211
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,720
Is the food I sent you

212
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
not to your taste?

213
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,400
No.

214
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,400
I asked Wei Duo

215
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
to go to the palace to get the ceremony.

216
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,400
And the snacks

217
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
were checked on the way.

218
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,280
It seems that Nan Jun's cold

219
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,600
has been cured.

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,960
Then stay at home and have a good rest.

221
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,840
Don't work around the corner.

222
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
In the whole He Mansion,

223
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
you're the most talkative

224
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,400
and the most thoughtful.

225
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,160
Nan Jun is not here.

226
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,680
By the way,

227
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,320
in a few days,

228
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
it will be the birthday of my grandmother.

229
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,200
In previous years,

230
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
it was my mother's birthday.

231
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,960
But she is not convenient this year.

232
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
So I'll leave it to you.

233
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,120
I can't believe I saw Boya

234
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,320
get into the Qiao family's game

235
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
and lost Xiao Gang.

236
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,120
You are a famous person.

237
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
You lost to a horseman.

238
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
You're making people laugh.

239
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,640
Master.

240
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,600
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
Please forgive me.

253
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,320
Don't get yourself hurt.

254
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,160
This is the trick of the Yans.

255
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
Why don't you

256
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,960
press the button

257
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
and give him a chance to atone for his sin?

258
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,640
Thank you, Master.

259
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

260
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,440
Here.

261
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,560
Now,

262
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,640
Wei and Yanzhou are working together.

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
This is not easy.

264
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Since Li Su died,

265
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
Yanzhou's two armies are lacking.

266
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,320
Their forces are not strong enough to fight against Wei.

267
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,320
It's better not to fight them in a short period of time.

268
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
You're smart.

269
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,960
I've been carrying the Mudan Fate Pavilion since I was a child.

270
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,680
It's like

271
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm going to marry the master of the Central Plains.

272
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Naturally, I should have the support.

273
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
You're great.

274
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm the lucky one.

275
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
I don't deserve this flower.

276
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,200
How can you say such a sad thing?

277
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,560
Although I married you,

278
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I haven't been able to have children.

279
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
I was thinking

280
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,760
if I could have a talent

281
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,760
and a good-looking child,

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,760
and have you raise him,

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,440
I could share your worries.

284
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,560
About this matter,

285
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,600
I have you to help me.

286
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,160
Shi.

287
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,160
Uncle.

288
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Greetings, Master.

289
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,160
My Lord.

290
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,760
Shi's condition is getting better.

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
I've sent people to Tazhou

292
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,840
to find a good doctor.

293
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Soon,

294
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
we'll be able to reach Dan Jun.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Uncle.

296
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,800
I have the female army to take care of.

297
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,080
You don't have to worry about me.

298
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,160
Since Shi's marriage,

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,400
the state of Bian has been in a state of crisis.

300
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,040
Now even my nephew is sick.

301
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
I'd like to ask

302
00:17:36,440 --> 00:18:04,700
whether the quartz

303
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,900
I need to discuss it with you.

304
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,100
But Wushan Kingdom

305
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,780
specifically mentioned it.

306
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,260
So what?

307
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,700
Is it because my brother-in-law is not willing?

308
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,900
He is so sick.

309
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,980
What if...

310
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,860
No ifs.

311
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,460
Chen Pang is the one who worries about him the most.

312
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,180
Although he is a member of the Bianzhou family,

313
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,340
he never takes me seriously.

314
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,980
He always provokes me.

315
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,100
Send someone to keep an eye on Su Nv.

316
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,780
Once he finds out that he has a grudge against the Bianzhou family,

317
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,100
report to him immediately.

318
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,740
Yes.

319
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,220
Your Majesty,

320
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,220
the birthday banquet of Great Madam

321
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,260
is very important.

322
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,660
But we don't know anything.

323
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,140
What should we do?

324
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,740
We don't know anything.

325
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,500
But we know someone.

326
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,260
Your Ladyship,

327
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,820
the process of the birthday banquet

328
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,420
is arranged in accordance with the rules you want.

329
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,420
There are still some problems.

330
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,420
Please see if it is different from the past.

331
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,100
Go away.

332
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,380
Don't bother me.

333
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
The preparation for the birthday banquet

334
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,700
should be put aside.

335
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,460
You may leave.

336
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,260
Yes.

337
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,140
I'll leave now.

338
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,380
How long did I spend

339
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,700
to make it clear

340
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,420
that you like it?

341
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,500
He just came.

342
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,460
He knows better than me.

343
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,260
Fine.

344
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,820
Let him do it.

345
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,220
Let him experience

346
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,860
the pain I suffered back then.

347
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,140
Your Ladyship,

348
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,380
don't worry.

349
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,740
He has only been in the mansion for a long time.

350
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,420
He must know nothing.

351
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,100
Let him do it.

352
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
If anything goes wrong,

353
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,540
it's none of our business.

354
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,900
We're quite quiet.

355
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,580
Here, Your Ladyship, have some tea.

356
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,540
Greetings, Granny.

357
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,860
Granny has served you for many years.

358
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,220
You must know

359
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,780
your grandmother's hobby best.

360
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,380
Of course.

361
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,980
I just came to the mansion.

362
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,060
I know nothing.

363
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,100
So I want to ask you for advice.

364
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,420
What advice?

365
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,180
What do you want to ask me for advice?

366
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,060
You're so smart

367
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,300
and talkative.

368
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
You can do things.

369
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,460
What can I teach you?

370
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm not a talented person.

371
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
Granny,

372
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,860
the reason why Nan Jun

373
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
gave me the birthday banquet

374
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
is because he was afraid

375
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,860
you'd get tired.

376
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,780
If you can't do it well,

377
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,500
and your grandmother is upset,

378
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,340
we shouldn't think about it.

379
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
You're quite self-aware.

380
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,020
Besides, there will be

381
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,780
many relatives at the birthday banquet.

382
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,260
If things go wrong,

383
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm afraid I'll lose Nan Jun's reputation.

384
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
That won't do.

385
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,260
Yes.

386
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,660
So I want to ask you

387
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,260
to tell me about your past habits.

388
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,140
I'll also teach you

389
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,500
how to call your grandmother's name.

390
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,900
If you can do it well,

391
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,540
I'll be able to teach you.

392
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,060
If you can't do it well,

393
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,460
I can do it alone.

394
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,100
Just do it as I said.

395
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,380
Don't let those relatives

396
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
laugh at you.

397
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
Besides,

398
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,700
don't let that person

399
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,140
steal Zhong Lin's reputation.

400
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,580
That person.

401
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
That person?

402
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,660
You were Nan Jun's cousin.

403
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Lord Weishi.

404
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,180
I heard he's Nan Jun's aunt

405
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,860
and his servant's illegitimate son.

406
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,980
Although he was born with a poor background,

407
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,540
he followed the fate of the old Marquis.

408
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,660
Great Madam loves him very much.

409
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,060
She went out to build a house when she was older.

410
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,020
I heard from Wei Liang

411
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,580
that Lord Weishi has been traveling abroad these two years.

412
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,220
He only sends back some things

413
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,660
during the holidays.

414
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,420
So the new bride of the female king didn't arrive.

415
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,260
Then I should call him my cousin

416
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,060
along with Nan Jun.

417
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,660
But what kind of person is he?

418
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,460
Lord Weishi has been a busybody since he was a child.

419
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,900
He always wanders around the nine-storied flower room.

420
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,740
I heard that half-dressed women are too soft.

421
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,660
If he returns to the army,

422
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,580
men will suffer.

423
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
No wonder.

424
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,740
These days, I found that

425
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,660
many women on the street

426
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,500
are more beautiful than before.

427
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,580
Lord Weishi.

428
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,300
What new stuff are you wearing?

429
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,700
You like them all.

430
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,780
Lord Weishi.

431
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,860
Come here.

432
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,980
Prepare the food.

433
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,140
I'll be right there.

434
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,620
Don't forget it.

435
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,180
Yes.

436
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,340
I heard that he not only plants flowers and plants,

437
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,300
but also has many wives and children.

438
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,380
He is a very romantic man.

439
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,300
Luckily, he doesn't stay at home.

440
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,180
He stays at the nine-storied flower room for seven days

441
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,820
and stays at the mansion for three days.

442
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
Two girls in this piece of land

443
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,020
and two men in the same house.

444
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,420
Luckily, Nan Jun is not like that.

445
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,820
Nan Jun is different from him.

446
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,420
Forget it.

447
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,900
Let's not talk about him.

448
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,300
If we don't get in touch with him,

449
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,700
we'll be less of a nuisance.

450
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
Prepare for Sun Mu's birthday banquet.

451
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,580
Yes.

452
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,420
We're back.

453
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,380
We're back.

454
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,540
Lord Weishi.

455
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,420
The people of the Taihe order us to come.

456
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,700
Welcome Lord Weishi.

457
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,420
Greetings to Lord Weishi.

458
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,380
We're back.

459
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,940
Lord Weishi is back.

460
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Why haven't you changed at all in the past three years?

461
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,940
What did you eat?

462
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,620
Don't be so mean, Lord Weishi.

463
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,980
I'm just kidding.

464
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,460
Great Madam is still waiting for you in the mansion.

465
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

466
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
I should be the one to punish her.

467
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,300
I'll go into the mansion and apologize to her.

468
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,940
Yes.

469
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,820
I'll go tell Great Madam.

470
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,980
Great Madam.

471
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,340
I don't know where Shiyuan is.

472
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,140
It's no use being anxious.

473
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,620
Shiyuan came back to celebrate my birthday.

474
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,980
If you can't wait, you can go back.

475
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,180
Great Madam.

476
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,460
Great Madam.

477
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,020
Lord Weishi is back.

478
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,820
Greetings, Great Madam.

479
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,820
Hurry up. Get up.

480
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,220
Let me take a good look.

481
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,260
You've lost weight.

482
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,140
You're so chubby.

483
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,620
Many ladies say that I'm extraordinary.

484
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,980
But you're not as good as them.

485
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,660
It shows that in the past three years,

486
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,540
I've met many handsome young men.

487
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,580
You're still so talkative.

488
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,300
You're still talkative.

489
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,140
Talkative.

490
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,580
Are you feeling well?

491
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,140
I'm fine.

492
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Greetings, Great Madam.

493
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,140
Zhong Lin, are you feeling well?

494
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,340
I'm fine.

495
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,260
I heard that you married a new wife.

496
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,580
You look like a champion.

497
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,980
Why didn't you bring her out and let me see her?

498
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,740
Shiyuan is talking nonsense again.

499
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420
Qiao's birthday party is over these days.

500
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,900
I'll take her there in person.

501
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Come and see me.

502
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,100
You reminded me of your birthday party.

503
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
Come on.

504
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,660
I brought gifts for the royal family.

505
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,180
These are for you.

506
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
Wait a minute.

507
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,860
I have something for you two.

508
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Come on.

509
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Come on.

510
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
This is for you.

511
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,340
This is for you.

512
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Thank you, Great Madam.

513
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,780
Open it.

514
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,060
This is a jade pot.

515
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,980
When I married into Weishuang,

516
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,780
your grandfather gave it to me.

517
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,180
Today, I'll give it to you two.

518
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Thank you, Great Madam.

519
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,460
Thank you, Great Madam.

520
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,580
This is a treasure.

521
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,780
It's well preserved.

522
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,020
Great Madam loves her grandson.

523
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,460
We are all like her.

524
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,220
Shiyuan, you've been away for three years.

525
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,660
Your grandmother is a jade pot.

526
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,140
She didn't even take out a stone

527
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,260
to give it to you.

528
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm in a good mood today.

529
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,380
Don't say too much.

530
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Sit down.

531
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Okay.

532
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,420
The gifts sent by the army of Gezhou

533
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,660
must be registered well.

534
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,380
The goods and people must be matched.

535
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,180
There must be no mistake.

536
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

537
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Your Majesty.

538
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,620
Are the gifts for your grandmother ready?

539
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,180
I've been picking out

540
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,820
but I haven't picked out the right ones.

541
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Open it.

542
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
Okay.

543
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,060
This jade pot

544
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,660
is the grandmother's favorite.

545
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,460
But it was transferred to me today.

546
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,860
If I keep it,

547
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,260
it's not appropriate.

548
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,020
So you can find a skilled craftsman

549
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,420
to make a match.

550
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,820
Take it as a birthday gift

551
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,060
and give it to your grandmother.

552
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,140
I've never seen jade pot before.

553
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,780
But this one is of good quality

554
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,260
and is a good material.

555
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,980
If I don't make a jade bracelet for my grandmother,

556
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,260
she will definitely like it.

557
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
You can make a decision.

558
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,660
Thank you for your concern.

559
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,220
When did I care about you?

560
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,660
I just want to make my grandmother happy.

561
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
Don't think too much.

562
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,860
I have something to do. I'll go first.

563
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,260
Why are you driving so fast?

564
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,900
Go.

565
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,420
Manager.

566
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,740
Miss Tao, you're here.

567
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,420
I have an important meeting today.

568
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,780
I have a project lead for my wife.

569
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,340
Who's that?

570
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,500
That's so nice looking.

571
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,060
Yet she meets you

572
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,740
on her way home as a student.

573
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,540
Look,

574
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,380
you said you have never met edge transaction.

575
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,980
to the elders in the family.

576
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,260
Please help me

577
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,380
to make a dragon phoenix

578
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,740
to make a lucky charm.

579
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,500
I'll think about it.

580
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,300
Look carefully. Don't drop it.

581
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
Be careful.

582
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
What's wrong with the dragon phoenix?

583
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,180
I told you not to drop it.

584
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,140
I deserve to die.

585
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,020
Please forgive me.

586
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,940
All right.

587
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,660
You can see if it affects the pattern first.

588
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,060
The dragon phoenix is a delicate and complex pattern.

589
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,460
Such a big crack

590
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,740
must be a problem.

591
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,100
What else can you do?

592
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,420
He is also

593
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,260
a street horseman in the daytime.

594
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,340
He is so good at making things up.

595
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,220
It's my fault.

596
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,740
I apologize to you.

597
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,940
Can I

598
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,500
make up for it?

599
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,060
Come in and make up for it.

600
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,660
Ladies and gentlemen,

601
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,580
it's your kindness.

602
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,740
But I can't be indifferent.

603
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,780
Come on. Let me see.

604
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,660
The upper layer of jade.

605
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,940
Such a waste of jade.

606
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,220
Let me think about it.

607
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,380
The upper layer of jade.

608
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,780
Even if it's for the elders,

609
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,940
the phoenix is not as delicate as the dragon phoenix,

610
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,020
but it has a more blessed meaning.

611
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,180
Maybe it's different from the jade.

612
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,580
It looks like it.

613
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,980
Please come here.

614
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,780
Look at it. Don't drop it.

615
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,180
Be careful.

616
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,540
Thank you for your advice.

617
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,020
You're welcome.

618
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,220
I just made a new hairpin.

619
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,940
It needs a steel-like shape.

620
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,260
If you really want to thank me,

621
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,180
please ask me.

622
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,140
You are a role model.

623
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,940
This hairpin is a perfect match.

624
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,140
Do you think it matches me?

625
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,420
You are not good at it.

626
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,940
I won't force you.

627
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,140
Mr. Wei, take care.

628
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,020
Wei?

629
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,740
Which Wei?

630
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,500
How many Wei are there in Yujin?

631
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,820
This is Mr. Wei.

632
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,700
He is really reckless.

633
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,820
I heard that he has recruited

634
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,700
many more women in Yujin.

635
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,940
It's so cool that he has a pote.

636
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,940
You won't get married on your wedding day.

637
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,980
It wants to find a Bar-dress for me.

638
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,260
Great.

639
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,820
To meet with you is so nice.

640
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,620
But you have to be careful

641
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,060
when serving the crown prince.

642
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,820
This place is not a study.

643
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,580
Bar-dress is not suitable for

644
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,340
finally meeting the crown prince.

645
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,260
Follow me, please.

646
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,100
Let's go.

647
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,100
The King of Yan

648
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,420
This is...

649
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,380
Your Majesty.

650
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,020
Isn't this the orchid of our Yan State?

651
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,020
Yes.

652
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,460
This time, Lord Wei

653
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,220
gave all the relatives a gift.

654
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,980
When Your Majesty came to the capital,

655
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,340
you must have been on a trip.

656
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,380
When you were passing through Yan State,

657
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,100
you asked someone to find three pots of orchids

658
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
and intended to give them to Your Majesty.

659
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,020
Unfortunately,

660
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,700
two pots were lost in the roadside fire.

661
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,020
Only the last pot

662
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,540
was left and was sent to Your Majesty.

663
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

664
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,980
Yes.

665
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,780
Look at this.

666
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,900
It must be selected by the Crown Prince.

667
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,180
It's hard to find such a table

668
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,940
in the whole Yan State.

669
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,780
The flowers are fine,

670
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,700
but the people are not.

671
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,940
These rich brothers

672
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,660
are full of weirdos.

673
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,460
People like us, the South Army,

674
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,700
are not like them.

675
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,700
Go find a better flower.

676
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,860
It's a good idea.

677
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,060
Okay, I'll write it down later.

678
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,060
I'll leave you to it.

679
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Okay, done.

680
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,540
The Second Madam gave a pair of white jade bracelets.

681
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,540
It's done.

682
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,820
It's done.

683
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

684
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,100
So many people gave us so many bracelets.

685
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,580
Our bracelet is still the most beautiful.

686
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,740
That's right.

687
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,820
Don't talk nonsense.

688
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,580
The gifts given by each state are very good.

689
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,420
But our jade pot is really precious,

690
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,820
so the jade bracelets made are also more beautiful.

691
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,060
It can be seen that the South Army

692
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,060
has a group of female soldiers

693
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,620
who are proud of their status in front of the Great Madam.

694
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,580
They just want to please Your Majesty.

695
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,420
Your Majesty.

696
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,100
Yes, it's here.

697
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,500
The female soldiers are stuck here.

698
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,620
You can put the bracelet on the shelf...

699
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,580
Female soldiers?

700
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,940
Sister, you're here.

701
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,380
I'm Zhong Lin's cousin.

702
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,940
I'm sorry to bother you today.

703
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,780
Please introduce yourself to me in the future

704
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,460
and formally greet my sister.

705
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,580
So it's you, Mr. Wei.

706
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,660
I haven't thanked you for the orchid you sent me that day.

707
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,780
It's a small matter.

708
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,380
You don't have to take it to heart.

709
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,060
Then I'll put this thing...

710
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,620
I'll put it...

711
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,060
Here.

712
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,300
Don't forget to take it when your sister leaves.

713
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,900
The birthday banquet of the great grandmother is a big deal.

714
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,900
Everyone who enters the banquet must be thoroughly checked.

715
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,300
If anything happens,

716
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,660
ask me.

717
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,340
Yes.

718
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,660
Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Wei.

719
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,860
Let's go.

720
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,380
What's wrong?

721
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,820
The box of my bracelet is missing.

722
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,620
I just put it here.

723
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,740
Where did you put it?

724
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,780
Did you forget to put it away?

725
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,140
I put it here.

726
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,380
Here, here, here.

727
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,500
Where did you put it?

728
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,180
I just put it there.

729
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,380
Where did you put it?

730
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,380
Here.

731
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Did you find it?

732
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,580
The bracelet is lost.

733
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,580
It must be our fault.

734
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,780
Please punish us.

735
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,780
But we've checked

736
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,180
everyone who entered and left today.

737
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,780
No one could have hidden it.

738
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,660
I've seen that bracelet before.

739
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,580
After that,

740
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,100
Mr. Wei came in.

741
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,540
Mr. Wei and the people who entered after him,

742
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,980
you can check them carefully.

743
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,020
Mr. Wei and the people after him have checked.

744
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,220
Mr. Wei also told us not to slack off.

745
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,420
Lv Jun, check it carefully.

746
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,980
We can't rule.

747
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,180
Enough. Stop talking.

748
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,060
I'm getting more and more scared.

749
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,060
Lv Jun,

750
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
that's a birthday gift

751
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,260
prepared by the Southern Army especially for the Great Madam.

752
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,740
What if I blame myself?

753
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,900
What should I do?

754
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,540
How about

755
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,100
hiding it here?

756
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,740
It's wrong to leave something behind.

757
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,460
If we lie,

758
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,260
it will only cause more trouble.

759
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,220
I'm not good at it.

760
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,900
Please punish me.

761
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,420
What's wrong?

762
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,620
What's wrong with me?

763
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,780
Come on, get up and talk.

764
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,420
What's wrong?

765
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,020
The bracelet I gave to the Great Madam

766
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,540
is missing.

767
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,620
What happened?

768
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,860
The people in the warehouse have checked it.

769
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,740
No one took it out without permission.

770
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,860
The guards were waiting at the door.

771
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,100
No one took it out.

772
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,820
But the thing is missing.

773
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,820
Now everyone in and out of the mansion

774
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,180
knows that the Southern Army is going to give the bracelet to the Great Madam.

775
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,620
But the bracelet is missing at this time.

776
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,820
If the Great Madam is disappointed,

777
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,220
it's all my fault.

778
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,980
I hope the Southern Army will punish me.

779
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,660
I'm not a big deal.

780
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,460
It's okay.

781
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,460
Someone in the warehouse will keep it.

782
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,580
It can't be lost.

783
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,020
We can look for it tomorrow.

784
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,340
And what if it's lost?

785
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Don't take it to heart.

786
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,660
Right, I have something to do in the mansion.

787
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,580
I'm going out.

788
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,100
Okay.

789
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,260
The Southern Army just won the championship.

790
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,220
Why doesn't he care about it?

791
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,220
Yang Xiu.

792
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,780
What are you doing?

793
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,620
You're in a hurry.

794
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,900
The jade pot my grandmother gave me.

795
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,780
Use it for me.

796
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,180
You have one, too.

797
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,020
I have one.

798
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,700
But...

799
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,660
I hit the jade pot with my hand.

800
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,860
I wanted to be the birthday gift for my grandmother.

801
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
But I lost it.

802
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,460
You lost it?

803
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,940
Who's responsible for it?

804
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,980
Qiao Zhi is.

805
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,820
As the female monarch of Wei State,

806
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,740
he can't even do such a small thing?

807
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,340
No, he was very careful when he was working.

808
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,020
But this time...

809
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,860
This time, it's really an accident.

810
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,180
You found the bracelet?

811
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,100
Let me tell you.

812
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,220
This thing is so important.

813
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,860
You really...

814
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,740
Enough, don't touch it.

815
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,220
Give it to me. I'm in a hurry.

816
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,220
Hurry up.

817
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,100
Wait.

818
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,220
You took my jade pot.

819
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,100
You hit your bracelet.

820
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,980
You gave it to Qiao Zhi.

821
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,860
We have to calculate this account again.

822
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,740
Didn't we say that our brother...

823
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,100
didn't count the account?

824
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,820
No, no, no.

825
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,540
Look.

826
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,420
You hit the bracelet with my jade pot.

827
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,700
Then my jade pot is not worth it.

828
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,020
Qiao Zhi said that

829
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,340
this bracelet might not be lost.

830
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,380
When I find it,

831
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,700
I'll return it to you.

832
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,060
You have to check it carefully.

833
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,060
You check it.

834
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,060
Who is it?

835
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,700
It's strange.

836
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,620
The thing is in his house.

837
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
It's gone if I say it's gone.

838
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,020
It's a thief.

839
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,300
Is your sister here?

840
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Brother.

841
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,060
Sister.

842
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,940
Forgive me.

843
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,740
I'm sorry.

844
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,620
I'm sorry.

845
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm sorry.

846
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,300
I'm sorry.

847
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,180
I'm sorry.

848
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,060
I'm sorry.

849
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:28,940
I'm sorry.

850
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,860
I'm sorry.

851
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm sorry.

852
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,260
Forgive me for not coming on my own.

853
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,420
But I heard that

854
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,900
the precious bracelet was lost that day.

855
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,180
I happened to be in the warehouse that day.

856
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,460
I want to help find it.

857
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,100
Thank you, brother.

858
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,140
Don't worry.

859
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,540
The house is heavily guarded.

860
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,020
Such an important item

861
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
can't be lost.

862
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,460
Maybe

863
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,180
it was lost by accident.

864
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
Brother.

865
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I'm sorry.

866
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
I'm sorry.

870
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,180
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
I'm sorry.

872
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
I'm sorry.

873
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
I'm sorry.

874
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
I'm sorry.

875
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm sorry.

876
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,660
I'm sorry.

877
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
I'm sorry.

879
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm sorry.

880
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620
I'm sorry.

881
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm sorry.

882
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,340
Look over there.

883
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
It's this one.

884
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,100
It's this jade bracelet.

885
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,980
Where did you find it?

886
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,180
I said

887
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,180
I can find it.

888
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,900
Maybe someone touched it.

889
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,020
The main thing is that this jade pot is made of good material.

890
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,180
And it's from grandma to Nan Jun.

891
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,580
If I accidentally lost it,

892
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,420
I would feel guilty.

893
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,580
Thank you for helping me out today.

894
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,460
It's okay.

895
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
This jade pot

896
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,940
was given to grandma by her grandfather

897
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,540
when she married into Weiguo.

898
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,620
It's indeed a precious material.

899
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,540
It's clear that grandma gave it to the people

900
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,820
out of her kindness.

901
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,780
In the future,

902
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,700
you must be extra careful

903
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,300
and don't make any mistakes.

904
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,300
You're right.

905
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,900
This jade pot

906
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,460
is indeed a rare material in the world.

907
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,700
Even Yu Jun Cheng

908
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,580
doesn't have it.

909
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,220
In this way,

910
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,780
when you were at the jewelry store that day,

911
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,540
you should have recognized this jade pot

912
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,580
and recognized my identity.

913
00:42:40,780 --> 00:43:05,940
That's it.

914
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,260
Your intonation is really wise.

915
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,460
wrong.

916
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,140
Sell it to me.

917
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:48,620
The Moonlight is like the deep sea, the night is silent, the snow is singing.

918
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:56,620
How lucky to be in a dream, and to have a long life.

919
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,620
The Moonlight is like the deep sea, the night is silent, the snow is singing.

920
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:08,620
How lucky to be in a dream, and to have a long life.

921
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:17,620
The flower has crossed my finger, and my heart has been moved.

922
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:25,620
As if I were an old friend, but I still have a longing.

923
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:34,620
The moon is like the deep sea, the night is silent, the snow is singing.

924
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:42,620
I once wandered around the world, but I couldn't understand it.

925
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:51,620
The wind and fire are together, like a eternal love.

926
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:59,620
How can I forget the beautiful scenery?

927
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:05,620
I want to cross the sea and touch your wind.

928
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,620
Waiting for the white snow to fall.

929
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,620
The words of Jiangnan are all in your eyes.

930
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,620
I want to keep them in my heart.

931
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:22,620
I want to sing a song to cover your smile.

932
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,620
Even if the wind and snow are different.

933
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,620
No matter how many times I have to think about it.

934
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,620
I will never forget this life.

935
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,620
I want to cross the sea and touch your wind.

936
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,620
Waiting for the white snow to fall.

The words of Jiangnan are all in your eyes.

938
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,620
I want to keep them in my heart.

00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,620
I want to sing a song to cover your smile.

00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Even if the wind and snow are different.

00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:12,620

00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:20,620
I will never forget this life.
