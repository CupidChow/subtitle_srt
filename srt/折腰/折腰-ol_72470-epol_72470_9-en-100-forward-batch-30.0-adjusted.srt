You're home early today.

31
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,500
(Wise Kashyapa Who Governs Eternally)

32
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,340
I am.

33
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,580
To congratulate you.

34
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,660
Why is that?

35
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,020
Do you know

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,460
who the Commander of Boya Forces is?

37
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,820
Who is it?

38
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
Your brother-in-law.

39
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,780
Bi Zhi.

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,980
You must be joking, My Lord.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,540
My brother-in-law is just a stableman.

42
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,380
You really don't know?

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,380
Your brother-in-law

44
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,500
is quite remarkable.

45
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,820
He not only

46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,900
defeated Xue Tai,

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,540
but did so more than once.

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,900
Really?

49
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,980
I can't believe he pulled that off.

50
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,740
That means Cousin's days ahead

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,180
could finally be peaceful.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,340
But then again,

53
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,820
how peaceful can it really be?

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,380
He claimed Boya all on his own.

55
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,420
Different factions

56
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,780
will go after him.

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,140
But he's just one man, not much power.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
My uncle,

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,260
wary of your reputation,

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,060
won't accept him easily.

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,660
Neither of them can go home now.

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,740
Typical Qiao. Always defiant.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,620
Were you copying sutras just now?

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,420
Yes.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,820
Do you like the armrest I gave you?

66
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
I do.

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,940
It's made from fresh southern bamboo.

68
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,900
It never feels sticky.

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,220
I treasured it too much,

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,900
so I hardly dared use it.

71
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,260
It's all right.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,700
It's not that rare, anyway.

73
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,940
This bamboo, though,

74
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,780
it's truly quite fine.

75
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,580
My Lord.

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,180
You work so hard every day

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,860
and often suffer headaches.

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,460
I thought perhaps,

79
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,900
your pillow wasn't comfortable.

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
So I made you a new one.

81
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,460
(That pattern…)

82
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,180
(What's she trying to imply?)

83
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,900
Did you embroider it?

84
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,860
No.

85
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,660
I asked Chunniang to sew it,

86
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,180
but I picked the fabric myself.

87
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,220
And this pattern…

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,700
I…

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,980
I just thought

90
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,140
the fabric was so soft.

91
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,340
It must be comfortable for sleep.

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,700
Thank you.

93
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,300
Why is he acting so odd today?

94
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,940
He insisted you read and write here.

95
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,780
Wait.

96
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,660
The fabric is
of Flourishing Descendants pattern.

97
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,140
Why didn't you tell me?

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,180
Flourishing Descendants?

99
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,660
You said it was just soft fabric.

100
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,540
And,

101
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,580
that armrest's jade.

102
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,740
You didn't say that either.

103
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,980
My Lord.

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,780
Rest assured, sir.

105
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,220
I've already asked her.

106
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,020
As for this matter,

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,370
no matter how bold the Qiao Clan is,

108
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,090
they wouldn't dare raise a flag in Boya.

109
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,100
What did Mrs. Wei say?

110
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,220
You can rest assured.

111
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,420
Bi Zhi may have some skills

112
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,980
and defeated Xue Tai several times,

113
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,420
but the Qiao Clan won't accept him.

114
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,620
He's just

115
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,020
looking for a foothold.

116
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,740
As long as there's no flag,

117
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,660
Boya remains unclaimed.

118
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,100
And since he's fighting Xue Tai,

119
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,580
he poses no threat to us.

120
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,980
Just keep things as they are.

121
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,460
Only a few hundred men?

122
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,860
General,

123
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,900
those hunting in the woods

124
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,060
were very agile.

125
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,300
Not mere servants.

126
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Wei Shao

127
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,980
has intervened in Boya,

128
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,820
dressing his soldiers in plain clothes.

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,660
What's his intention?

130
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,980
Luckily, we didn't rush to attack.

131
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,660
He was once Qiao's stableman,

132
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,180
and is Qiao Yue's son-in-law now.

133
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,140
In truth,

134
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,540
he's family to the Wei traitors.

135
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,260
Yanzhou has two such sons-in-law now,

136
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,820
and they're both carving out territory.

137
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,860
We won't engage.

138
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,890
Withdraw the troops.

139
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

140
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,660
Xue Tai has withdrawn?

141
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,860
That's right.

142
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,500
He left just like that?

143
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
My friend,

144
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,900
we owe this to you.

145
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,340
General, you flatter me.

146
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,260
I didn't do much.

147
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,220
Even though Xue Tai has retreated,

148
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,700
we declared ourselves

149
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,860
commander here.

150
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,900
There will be trouble again.

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,420
So what should we do?

152
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,940
You drove off the bandits

153
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,140
and have won the people's trust.

154
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,460
Find a hilltop

155
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,020
and raise a command flag.

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,660
It'll look like you're asking

157
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,680
for the people's support.

158
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,020
If you do this,

159
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
more will follow you,

160
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,220
and fewer will cause trouble.

161
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,100
But what kind of flag?

162
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,740
I only know horses.

163
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,900
That's easy.

164
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,220
I've seen plenty of flags.

165
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,700
Bring a plain piece of cloth.

166
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,840
Xing.

167
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,700
Yes.

168
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,660
But what should we write on it?

169
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,780
We can't write "Zhi" (swine).

170
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,140
A command flag

171
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,780
declares ownership.

172
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
If it bears the character "Wei,"

173
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,140
it means this place belongs to Wei.

174
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,740
If trouble arises later,

175
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,900
Wei will have to step in.

176
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,220
If it becomes Wei territory,

177
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,860
wouldn't that cause problems
for the Lord of Wei?

178
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,460
Xue Tai is stationed at Xiaogang,

179
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,780
across the river from Boya and Panyi.

180
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
This trip

181
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,460
is not for battle,

182
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,620
but to probe.

183
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,500
We can't let others think

184
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,180
that Wei plans to occupy Boya.

185
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,620
Dear, what if

186
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,300
we write your surname,

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,460
Qiao?

188
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,300
That's a good idea.

189
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,820
Xing, bring more liquor.

190
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,540
We must thank General Wei Qu.

191
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Yes.

192
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,940
(Qiao)

193
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,920
Ma'am.

194
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,780
General Bi Zhi.

195
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,780
Don't bother.

196
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
Take care, General.

197
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,580
Take care.

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,820
Hyah.

199
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,740
(Qiao)

200
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,660
You raised the flag for Qiao.

201
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,500
You handled such a big matter

202
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,620
and only brought back some wild game

203
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,460
and sacks of rice?

204
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,780
It was my oversight.

205
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,020
You ordered me

206
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,060
to ensure no one thought

207
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,300
Wei intervened.

208
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
But everything was ruined by hesitation.

209
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,340
Looks like all you do is hunt and drink.

210
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,380
After a few drinks,

211
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,540
you've forgotten who you are.

212
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,500
My Lord,

213
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,060
Wei Qu can't be blamed for this.

214
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,580
Who would've thought
Qiao was so bold?

215
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,420
They challenged you

216
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,660
over Boya.

217
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,500
Yong.

218
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,660
Sir.

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,800
Sir.

220
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,780
- Speak.
- My voice...

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,900
My Lord,

222
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,540
if anyone's to blame, it's Bi Zhi.

223
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,940
All brawn,

224
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,220
no brains.

225
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,380
Fought so hard for a piece of land,

226
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,260
only to fly

227
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,590
his wife's surname on the flag.

228
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,010
Sounds like a kept man.

229
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,180
Who are you mocking?

230
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,340
My Lord.

231
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,380
We haven't seen it coming.

232
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,430
It's a misunderstanding.

233
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,420
A misunderstanding?

234
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,860
How could things line up so perfectly?

235
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,540
No need for you to tell me.

236
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,700
I know who's behind this.

237
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,460
My Lord,

238
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,580
could it truly be as the advisor said,

239
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,020
that this is Mrs. Wei's doing?

240
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,060
I underestimated her.

241
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,780
You all remember this:

242
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,540
Stay away from the Qiao Clan.

243
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
Or you'll be dumb.

244
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
Yes.

246
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,620
You may all rise.

247
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,900
I can

248
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,980
give up Boya,

249
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,100
but I won't just hand it to Yanzhou.

250
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,100
It was a losing game,

251
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
yet she managed to turn it around.

252
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,500
(Xiaogang, Boya)

253
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,420
Send the order:

254
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,460
Attack Xiaogang immediately.

255
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,780
My Lord,

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,940
Liangya's army guards Xiaogang.

257
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,340
That land belonged to Wei.

258
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,220
But 14 years ago,

259
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,740
it was taken while we were weak.

260
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,540
Lady Qiao

261
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,340
(Panyi)
gave me Panyi without fuss,

262
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,340
(Boya)
but secretly let Bi Zhi take Boya.

263
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,340
That gives Yanzhou a new gateway.

264
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,860
So,

265
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
keeping troops in Panyi

266
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,840
will be pointless.

267
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,300
To strike back,

268
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,460
we must open

269
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,980
a new front.

270
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Boya and Xiaogang face each other.

271
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,820
(Xiaogang)
From there,

272
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,940
we can monitor Bi Zhi closely.

273
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,020
You four,

274
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,820
gather the troops.

275
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,020
Set out for Xiaogang.

276
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,900
Wei Qu,

278
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
this is your chance to redeem yourself.

279
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,500
Don't waste it.

280
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,340
Understood.

281
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,500
Any other orders?

282
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,180
From today on,

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,100
all correspondence from the Qiao Clan

284
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,660
comes through me.

285
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,020
Got it.

286
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,620
I don't think

287
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,780
any of us should get married.

288
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,340
Marriage just turns

289
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,660
into mind games.

290
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,740
Don't count me in.

291
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,880
Only you

292
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,260
could be outwitted by your own kin.

293
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,900
And My Lord, too.

294
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,020
Enough.

295
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,660
My Lady.

296
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,820
What's this?

297
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,500
You're home early today.

298
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,580
These are wild game from Boya.

299
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,180
And this rice too.

300
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,220
Come.

301
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,260
Specially prepared for you.

302
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,260
Cousin sent these?

303
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,820
Yes.

304
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,220
You two share a deep bond,

305
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,340
looking out for each other.

306
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,220
It's truly moving.

307
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,180
But it's not even mealtime yet.

308
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,580
I can't eat these.

309
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,860
You made me shoes,

310
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,980
pillows,

311
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,340
and meals.

312
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,460
This meal

313
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,620
is to thank you.

314
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,140
Dig in.

315
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,660
Try this.

316
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,740
The meat is good.

317
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,140
- My Lord.
- It's tasty.

318
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,820
I can't eat that much.

319
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
The kitchen made this just for you.

320
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,300
Eat more.

321
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,700
Eat.

322
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,140
He said not to associate with Qiao.

323
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,140
Does that include Xiaotao?

324
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,220
Probably.

325
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,660
Duang,

326
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,700
I heard General Wei Qu is back.

327
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,820
How is Miss Daqiao doing in Boya?

328
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,260
I'm talking to you here.

329
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
Duang.

330
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Xiaotao,

331
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,020
can you leave me alone?

332
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,860
My Lord said

333
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,540
to stay away from you people.

334
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,740
Said we might turn dumb.

335
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,260
How does your dumbness

336
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,100
have anything to do with us?

337
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,460
Duang, how is she?

338
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,700
Xiaotao,

339
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,620
I'm truly on official duty now.

340
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,740
We messed up in Boya,

341
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,460
and now we're making up for it.

342
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,460
My Lord is sending troops to Xiaogang.

343
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,260
So please, stop bothering me.

344
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,660
Xiaogang?

345
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I really can't eat more.

346
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,460
Just a bit more.

347
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,300
Look.

348
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,980
The rice is from Boya.

349
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,180
Have some more.

350
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,580
Did you

351
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,660
come here for something?

352
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,940
Not really.

353
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,340
I just wanted to ask you,

354
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,500
what have you been busy with lately?

355
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,580
Needlework and copying sutras.

356
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,860
Besides that?

357
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,540
Studying "The Analects"

358
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,860
and "The Book of Songs."

359
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,620
For example, letters to your cousin?

360
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,980
Just some

361
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,860
daily reminders.

362
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,700
Daily reminders?

363
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,780
Does that include

364
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,460
raising the Qiao flag in Boya?

365
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,060
I only heard him defeated the bandits,

366
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,220
so I gave a few reminders.

367
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Lady Qiao,

368
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,620
how cunning you are.

369
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,380
I don't understand

370
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,340
what you're saying.

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,340
Really?

372
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,260
You pretended to care,

373
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,500
made me drop my guard,

374
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,460
then used the box incident

375
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,860
to make me feel guilty.

376
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I couldn't

377
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,380
have planned guilt.

378
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,220
You had to be wrong first

379
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,580
for me to use it.

380
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,380
Exactly. You used that guilt.

381
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,780
Faked deep sibling affection.

382
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,820
Used the konghou to draw my concern.

383
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,660
Right?

384
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,380
Missing my cousin is real.

385
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,300
But your love for music is fake, right?

386
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,700
After all these days,

387
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,880
why does it still sound awful?

388
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,860
Besides,

389
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,820
if you want Boya,

390
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,180
you could've just told me.

391
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,620
Why manipulate my men

392
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
to send your letters?

393
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,710
Act all high and mighty

394
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,740
in front of Xue Tai?

395
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,820
No battle fought,

396
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,700
yet the Qiao flag flew over Boya.

397
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,780
My brother-in-law succeeded, huh?

398
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,500
Look at your smug face.

399
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,780
Look in a mirror.

400
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,220
Turns out, I was too naive.

401
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,780
You're a Wei wife in name,

402
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,260
but still a Qiao woman at heart.

403
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,940
He defeated Xue Tai

404
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,700
and helped Wei

405
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,220
get rid of a threat.

406
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,220
Raising the Qiao flag
shouldn't be a big deal.

407
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,660
Qiao and Wei are one family.

408
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,180
You won't attack
the Qiao Clan, will you?

409
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,060
Or,

410
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,380
the marriage between us

411
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,260
was all for show?

412
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,460
Is that why
you stationed troops in Panyi?

413
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,140
I can't out-talk you.

414
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,020
You always win with your words.

415
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,540
Words are all I have here.

416
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,180
Your words drive me mad.

417
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm done arguing.

418
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,740
However,

419
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,940
don't think holding a key position

420
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,340
means you can act reckless.

421
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,340
I'll always keep a knife

422
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,420
at Qiao's throat.

423
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,260
Mrs. Wei,

424
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,260
Wei Liang got all mad when he saw me.

425
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,900
Said his lord told him

426
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,540
not to go near the Qiao clan,

427
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,900
or he'd turn dumb.

428
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,460
Can you believe

429
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,580
how ridiculous he was?

430
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,220
But he's not entirely wrong.

431
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,100
Now they're so angry,
they're sending out troops.

432
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,060
Where to?

433
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,580
Xiaogang.

434
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,060
Chunniang.

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,540
When will Zhang Pu return to Kangjun?

436
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
My Lady.

437
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,820
He was ill

438
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,060
after coming to Yujun.

439
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,020
He likely hasn't recovered yet.

440
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,740
Have him come see me.

441
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,580
Yes.

442
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,730
Sir, when you return to Yanzhou,

443
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,980
could you take a detour to Boya

444
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,020
and deliver a message

445
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,500
to my cousin?

446
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm still sick.

447
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,140
Can't you just write a letter?

448
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,020
It's of great importance.

449
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,460
You must explain it in person.

450
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,180
Break it down for them.

451
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,260
I see.

452
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,660
Please tell me.

453
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,260
Wei Shao

454
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,620
is attacking Xiaogang today

455
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,020
to pin down Boya.

456
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,660
But in Yanzhou, there's a place

457
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,980
called Liancheng

458
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
close to Xiaogang.

459
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,540
If you take the mountain path,

460
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,180
it's a three-day trip.

461
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Tell my cousin,

462
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,740
to have her husband start mining there.

463
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,780
I've marked

464
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,460
the exact spot on this map.

465
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,500
(Yanzhou, Panyi, Liangya,
Wei State, Bianzhou)

466
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,180
(Boya)

467
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,780
Mining?

468
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,940
(Wei)

469
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,300
(Wei Shao set his sights on Xiaogang)

470
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,380
(as it's easy to defend
and hard to attack.)

471
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,060
(It could be used to pin down Boya.)

472
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,700
(But if we dig)

473
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,420
(a secret tunnel here,)

474
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,660
(Yanzhou's troops)

475
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,820
(could reach Xiaogang
within half a day.)

476
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,940
(In that case,)

477
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,580
(Xiaogang would be firmly
in Yanzhou's grasp.)

478
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Lady Xu,

479
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
Mrs. Wei is here.

480
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
Grandmother.

481
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,780
Did you see him off?

482
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,100
I did.

483
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,780
Have a seat.

484
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,060
Do you play Go?

485
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,140
Yes.

486
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,380
But I'm not skilled.

487
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,260
It's an art to be learned.

488
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,380
Beginners often focus

489
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,140
on capturing more pieces,

490
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,540
trying to wipe out the opponent.

491
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,660
And they lose because of it.

492
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,460
To win,

493
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,140
you have to yield a little.

494
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,540
But knowing how much to yield

495
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,100
takes judgment.

496
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,140
If both sides press too hard,

497
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,460
it ends

498
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,540
in a stalemate.

499
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
There may still be a winner,

500
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,940
but the board

501
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,260
looks ugly.

502
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,500
I will remember your words.

503
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,780
Do you think

504
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,740
I was talking about the game?

505
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,420
It was about marriage.

506
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,780
My Lord and I are not enemies,

507
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,860
but allies.

508
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,100
Still, maybe

509
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,940
I'm not good at Go.

510
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,940
I used to see him off to war.

511
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,820
Now you do.

512
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,620
That's a wife's duty.

513
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,140
I'm pleased.

514
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,260
But what I really hope is:

515
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,860
From now on,

516
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Zhonglin will

517
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,660
no longer go to war.

518
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,380
Do you know

519
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,980
what that means?

520
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,380
I understand.

521
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,620
Back then,

522
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,420
when your grandfather proposed,

523
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,260
he wrote me a letter,

524
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,940
confessing his past wrongs.

525
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,180
I resented your grandfather.

526
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,380
His betrayal

527
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,860
cost me my husband,

528
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,260
my son,

529
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,540
and my grandson.

530
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,340
But the dead can't come back.

531
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,180
Even if I wipe out the Qiao Clan,

532
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
would it ease our scars from the past

533
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,900
and the pain in our hearts

534
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,660
even a little?

535
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,260
But if

536
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,500
your marriage with Zhonglin

537
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,660
could resolve this hatred

538
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,900
and help him

539
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,940
let go of his obsessions,

540
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,700
so he no longer

541
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,180
spends his life in mourning,

542
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,940
what more

543
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,460
could I ask for?

544
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,860
Grandmother,

545
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,300
I've let you down.

546
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,780
It's all right.

547
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,380
Everything takes time.

548
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,220
Let's take it slow.

549
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,740
(Two Months Later)

550
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,740
(Government Office)
The Lord has returned.

551
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:29,740
The Lord has returned.

552
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,620
The Lord has returned.

553
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,580
The Lord has returned.

554
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,420
The Lord has returned.

555
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,620
The Lord has returned.

556
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,140
(Government Office)

557
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,500
My Lord, we claimed
a great victory at Xiaogang.

558
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,300
We gave Liu Yan of Liangya
a strong warning.

559
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,860
It truly lifts everyone's spirits.

560
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,620
How many times must I tell you?

561
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,540
Never judge by appearances alone.

562
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,060
Stationing troops at Xiaogang

563
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,540
isn't only about intimidating Liangya.

564
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,100
Besides reinforcing Xiaogang,

565
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,980
I have four more

566
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
tasks for you.

567
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,820
Yes.

568
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,580
First:

569
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,220
Increase patrols

570
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,340
along the Xiaogang-Liangya border.

571
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,780
You are wise and decisive.

572
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,300
Liangya has always eyed us.

573
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,540
Second:

574
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,260
Keep close watch

575
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,180
on military movements
between Yanzhou and Boya.

576
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,540
You're thorough and careful.

577
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,260
We must guard against an attack
from Boya.

578
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,300
Third:

579
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,220
Reinforce all frontier outposts.

580
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,340
Your foresight's unmatched.

581
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,700
We must watch every state's moves.

582
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,420
Fourth…

583
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,620
My Lord,

584
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,660
what's the fourth thing?

585
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,180
The fourth one.

586
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,260
Get my bedding back
to the main chamber.

587
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,900
I'm going to battle Lady Qiao

588
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,220
over every inch of ground.

589
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,780
Howe can you just barge in?

590
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,500
Do you have no respect?

591
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
This is the Lord and Lady's bedchamber.

592
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,260
No matter how often

593
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,460
you used to come,

594
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,340
from now on,
without being summoned,

595
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,660
no one may enter.

596
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,060
If we aren't moving in ourselves,

597
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,180
will you do it?

598
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,460
Didn't you just say

599
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,220
this is the Lord and Lady's bedchamber?

600
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,280
My Lord is moving back in.

601
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,140
Excuse me.

602
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,780
Careful.

603
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,260
Don't crush the Lady's quilt.

604
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,180
Get down.

605
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,060
Stop it. That's Mrs. Wei's books.

606
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,980
Get down.

607
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,820
Stop it.

608
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,900
What are you doing?

609
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,580
Don't touch the Lady's books.

610
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,860
Wait. She's just a woman,

611
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,900
she reads too?

612
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,140
My Lady could read at three,
recite poems at five.

613
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,220
Of course she reads.

614
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,100
Fine, fine.

615
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,780
Put those useless books
on the dressing table.

616
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,860
He won't use it anyway.

617
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,180
What?

618
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,420
You say it like he doesn't have a face.

619
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,140
The sword. I think it's best here.

620
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,540
It fits well right here.

621
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,620
You're leaving a sword here?

622
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,140
Does he practice it?

623
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,380
He's not just a swordsman.

624
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,860
He kills with ease.

625
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,780
Where should his clothes go?

626
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,660
This one

627
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,900
and those ones are My Lady's.

628
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,340
Well,

629
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
he can use that one.

630
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,500
So small?

631
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,000
Wait.

632
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,540
Why does she take up so much space?

633
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,500
Did she move all of Yanzhou in?

634
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,060
None of you four are married, right?

635
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,140
Anywhere, the woman's wardrobe

636
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,060
is always bigger.

637
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Really?

638
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,500
Makes sense.

639
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,860
With Xiaotao's temper, honestly,

640
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,100
who'd marry her?

641
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,890
What's she to you?

642
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,010
Why worry about that?

643
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,820
Come on.

644
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,900
Don't forget,

645
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,900
she's meant to marry into our family.

646
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,620
Well, just one of us.

647
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,860
Not it.

648
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,060
Me neither.

649
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,300
I'm not marrying her.

650
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,300
You…

651
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,340
Let's draw lots.

652
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,420
Alright. Fine.

653
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,100
Didn't we agree to draw lots?

654
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,220
Where is everyone?

655
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,780
My Lady, you should've seen them.

656
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,540
It was like they were
dividing up territory,

657
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,100
arguing over every inch.

658
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,700
Insisting on which part belonged to him,

659
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,940
and which to you.

660
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,140
But the two of you share a room,

661
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,660
how can it be split so neatly?

662
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,180
People say, easy with the ruler,

663
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
tough with the servants.

664
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,180
Just like Grandmother said.

665
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,860
When someone pushes,
another must yield.

666
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,260
I've raised the Qiao flag at Boya.

667
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,010
If he wants to get back elsewhere,

668
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,140
so be it.

669
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,540
Let's organize his things.

670
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,540
As for his bedding?

671
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,380
Just leave it for now.

672
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,500
All right.

673
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,740
What are you doing?

674
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,620
I saw you sleeping uneasily.

675
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,500
Maybe the candlelight was too bright.

676
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,940
So I wanted to put it out.

677
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
Don't.

678
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,180
Just wear more clothes

679
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,580
at night.

680
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,820
Don't try to seduce me.

681
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,060
I am the Lord of Wei.

682
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,540
I won't be swayed by beauty.

683
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,380
I had no such intent.

684
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,300
You speak in opposites.

685
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,340
You say no,

686
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,460
then it's yes.

687
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,540
If you say so,

688
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,540
then so be it.

689
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,180
Sir, please sit.

690
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,180
My Lord,

691
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,940
my cough hasn't healed yet,

692
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,740
so I dare not

693
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,220
drink with you.

694
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,900
Then,

695
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,140
just sit here

696
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,500
and keep me company.

697
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,700
My Lord,

698
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,060
there are many things

699
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,740
that can be shared with dearest ones.

700
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,180
No need to bear it all alone.

701
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,380
But I have no one to talk to.

702
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,780
No one understands.

703
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,460
It's all because he kills in dreams.

704
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,740
He made you lose sleep.

705
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,940
Even said you tried to seduce him.

706
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,620
How unfair.

707
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,220
He only said it to ease my worries.

708
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,900
You're always defending him.

709
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,660
He just talks, that's all.

710
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,180
He never hurt me.

711
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,180
Forget it. Go make some red bean soup.

712
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,660
My Lord?

713
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,020
Why is it so dark in here?

714
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,940
My Lord?

715
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,460
My…

716
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,540
They say the Lord of Wei kills
in his sleep,

717
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,700
never lets anyone near him
when sleeping.

718
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,820
My Lord.

719
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,660
Xiaozao…

720
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,500
Don't go.

721
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,100
Stay.

722
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,420
What's wrong?

723
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,860
Are you afraid of the dark?

724
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,300
It's okay.

725
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,740
It's all right.

726
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,860
I'm here for you.

727
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,860
It's all right.

728
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,500
Don't be afraid.

729
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm right here.

730
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,300
As the saying goes,

731
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,060
"A wise one knows when

732
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,400
to advance and when to retreat."

733
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,300
But this requires careful judgment.

734
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,180
A slight error,
and one crosses the line.

735
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,860
Bear insults

736
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,380
without flinching,

737
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,180
and see faults

738
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,940
without exposing.

739
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,140
My Lady, you should know

740
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,140
the art of wise companionship
better than I do.

741
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,410
You're talking about noble friendships.

742
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,920
But what about marriage?

743
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,140
It's the same

744
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,740
for you and My Lord.

745
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,140
I thought

746
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,980
he'd resent me over Boya.

747
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,100
But these past days,

748
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,380
I've realized he doesn't.

749
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,620
And now I don't know how to face him.

750
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,140
The Lord grew up in hatred,

751
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,700
inherited leadership young.

752
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,380
If he's sometimes cold,

753
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,820
it's only natural.

754
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,980
Please try to understand.

755
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,380
But I've served him in war for years.

756
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,500
I know him

757
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,540
better than anyone.

758
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,980
Then,

759
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,140
what's his true nature?

760
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,420
Tough on the outside,
soft on the inside.

761
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,460
