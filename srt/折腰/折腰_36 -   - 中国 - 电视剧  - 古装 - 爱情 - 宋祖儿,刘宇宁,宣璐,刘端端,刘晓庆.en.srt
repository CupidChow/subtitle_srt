30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,460
You two,

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,130
I suggest you surrender.

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,330
This is Yanzhou.

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,980
How can a Liangya man be in charge?

34
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,690
Soldiers, you might not know,

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,900
but your governor

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,100
was killed in Panyi
by the Lord of Liangya.

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,570
Liangya is hiding this

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,290
to divide Yanzhou later.

39
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,810
Really?

40
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,780
My brother is dead?

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,570
Qiao Yue is dead.

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,290
So, the prefect is

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,380
the governor now.

44
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,540
Are you sure

45
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,690
you want to fight him now?

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,770
Don't listen to him.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,930
Seize these two immediately.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,710
The Lord of Liangya
offers a heavy reward.

49
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,370
The Wei army will soon crush Panyi.

50
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,320
The Lord of Liangya
can barely protect himself,

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,170
let alone you.

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,940
Think carefully.

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,220
Will you listen to a Liangya man

54
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,170
or your prefect?

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,300
What should we do now?

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,170
Yeah.

57
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,610
Exactly.

58
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,570
What should we do?

59
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,660
What now?

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,170
Soldiers.

61
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,890
My brother

62
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,570
has been foolish for too long,

63
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,130
which led Yanzhou to this state.

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,820
If you don't betray me,

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,100
I won't

66
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,220
let your trust down.

67
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,290
Is the governor really dead?

68
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,170
I heard the same.

69
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,500
Even if he isn't,

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,660
I support the prefect.

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,100
The people believe him.

72
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,010
I support the prefect.

73
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,940
Me too.

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,170
Are you planning to rebel?

75
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,130
Seize that Liangya man.

76
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,890
Pass on my order:

77
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,720
Yanzhou will no longer

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,780
cooperate with Liangya.

79
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,260
Order Liancheng

80
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,450
to mobilize all troops

81
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,170
and retake Panyi.

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,820
Yes.

83
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,610
Prepare the finest coffin

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,290
for General Wei Liang.

85
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,170
Yes.

86
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,200
(The Governor of Yanzhou has defected,
planning to retake Panyi)

87
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,980
What can Qiao Ping do?

88
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,100
It's like an ant shaking a tree.

89
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,340
My Lord, you'll surely win.

90
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,300
However,

91
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,900
we can't

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,420
act rashly.

93
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,700
We have Daqiao.

94
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,340
Without Bi Zhi,

95
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,260
Yanzhou is not a threat.

96
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,540
Besides,

97
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,820
I have a special gift

98
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
for Wei Shao.

99
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,020
(Yujun City, Wei State)

100
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,820
My Lady,

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,780
Yujun lacks troops as expected.

102
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,020
Give me half a month,

103
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,400
and we can break through the gates.

104
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,260
You really are a fierce general.

105
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,140
Try your best to attack
with the Zhongzhou army.

106
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,780
Deputy Liu Xiao and 5,000 elite troops

107
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,780
will be under my command

108
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,900
to conserve our strength.

109
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,600
Yujun's troops were outnumbered,

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,700
but each one fought bravely.

111
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,180
This battle was thrilling.

112
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,020
Their bravery didn't matter.

113
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,220
They still lost.

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,900
General, you don't know.

115
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,060
The real thrill

116
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,420
is here.

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,730
(Trapped in Yongning)

118
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,540
Wei Shao was trapped
in Yongning City for days

119
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,900
with reduced forces.

120
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,060
Two days ago, he broke out,

121
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,700
leading his leftover troops

122
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,060
to Panyi.

123
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,860
Wei Shao actually gave up Yujun

124
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,980
for Panyi?

125
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,380
Guess what would happen

126
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,380
if Lady Qiao knew
where Wei Shao had gone

127
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,340
when Yujun was under attack?

128
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,140
The Lord didn't abandon us.

129
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,740
He did what a lord should do.

130
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,940
Zhonglin has his mission.

131
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,460
Yujun

132
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
is counting on us now.

133
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,940
But Yujun's not the only one
that's trapped.

134
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,260
They're seriously outnumbered in Panyi.

135
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,540
It's extremely dangerous.

136
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,740
If I can buy the Lord some time

137
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,260
and hold back some troops,

138
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,220
he can take Panyi,

139
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,580
and peace will return.

140
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,740
But Yujun

141
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,460
already lacks troops.

142
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,140
It might not hold out much longer.

143
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,580
Well...

144
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,180
My Lady.

145
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
How's the battle going?

146
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,500
General Wei Xiao, General Qiao Ci, and I

147
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,740
are guarding three city gates,

148
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,260
but Xue Tai's forces are strong,

149
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,080
and there's no capable commander
in the city.

150
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,600
I fear we won't be able
to hold out for long.

151
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,580
What should we do?

152
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,680
Who says there's no capable commander
in the city?

153
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,020
I understand your concern
for the Wei Clan,

154
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,860
so I didn't take the chance
to attack Wei.

155
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Don't make

156
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,340
more requests.

157
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,660
Young Master.

158
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,940
Please leave.

159
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,900
We have sworn to follow you

160
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,980
so we'll only obey your orders.

161
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,460
We'll only obey your orders.

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,100
We're ready to go to battle with you.

163
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
Grandmother,

164
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,420
I'm back.

165
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,780
Shiyuan.

166
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,980
Shiyuan!

167
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,700
Shiyuan.

168
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,460
Shiyuan is back.

169
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,900
Lady Xu of the Wei Clan,

170
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,940
today,

171
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,620
Wei and Bianzhou

172
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,980
have formed an alliance

173
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,580
over the canal project.

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,580
Now,

175
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,660
with Yujun under siege,

176
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,200
I hope you can provide troops for me

177
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,180
to fight outside the city

178
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,420
and defend Yujun together.

179
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,860
Good.

180
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,300
Good!

181
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,500
I will give you troops.

182
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Shiyuan,

183
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
you truly are the blood

184
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,580
of the Wei Clan.

185
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,900
(Wei Mansion)

186
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,980
Who are they?

187
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,360
They are soldiers from Bianzhou

188
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,780
coming to help Yujun with me.

189
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,060
They belong to Chen Pang?

190
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,020
Yes.

191
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,380
In the rush to help Yujun,

192
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,620
I neglected this.

193
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,980
If you care about their identities,

194
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,940
I will send them back.

195
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,780
Shiyuan.

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,380
Bianzhou and Wei

197
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,460
have old grudges,

198
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,740
but that's personal
between Chen Pang and me.

199
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,820
Today, all of you

200
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,380
(Wei Mansion)
followed Shiyuan here,

201
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
risking your lives

202
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,500
to support Yujun.

203
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,900
You are the saviors of Wei.

204
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,540
Please accept

205
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,220
my gratitude.

206
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,220
We chose to follow Young Master,

207
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,860
so we'll do our utmost

208
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,100
to live up to your trust.

209
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,100
Please rise, everyone.

210
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,340
Grandmother,

211
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,980
I'm going.

212
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,020
Be careful.

213
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,500
(Wei Mansion)

214
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's hope they can return safely,

215
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,500
and eternal peace may come.

216
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,300
When the Lord triumphs,

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,500
the grand scene you spoke of

218
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,620
will surely come true.

219
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,660
(Panyi City, Yanzhou)

220
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,340
(Qiao)

221
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,900
(Qiao)

222
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,700
Hyah.

223
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,220
(Panyi)

224
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,300
Hyah.

225
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,580
Whoa.

226
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,180
Do we

227
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,780
have to fight today?

228
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,620
You treat me like family,

229
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
but I have to fight against you

230
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,580
because my wife

231
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,820
is held hostage.

232
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,660
Bi Zhi!

233
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Wei Shao.

234
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,220
My Lord, ignore our relationship.

235
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,900
Attack.

236
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,780
Bi Zhi,

237
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,940
what are you waiting for?

238
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,620
Strike!

239
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,660
Bi Zhi, no!

240
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,340
Bi Zhi is a fitting name.

241
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,380
He's like

242
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,700
a filthy animal.

243
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Look.

244
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,500
Does he look like a beast,

245
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,820
mindlessly controlled by others?

246
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,100
Bi Zhi,

247
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,940
if you don't hurt Wei Shao,

248
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,580
I'll hurt your wife instead.

249
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,380
How can you do this to him?

250
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,500
We can only do this to him

251
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,420
because of you.

252
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,700
Let go!

253
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,900
(Yujun City, Wei)

254
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,980
Kill them!

255
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,660
General Xue is dead!

256
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,780
Run!

257
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,860
General Xue is dead!

258
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,780
Run!

259
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,520
Retreat!

260
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,460
Retreat!

261
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,620
(Yujun)

262
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,460
That green-eyed beast

263
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,900
really is fierce.

264
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
My Lord,

265
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,660
if Bi Zhi always serves you,

266
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,860
I believe

267
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,780
the realm

268
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
will eventually be yours.

269
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,220
Fierce or not,

270
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,540
he's just a wild animal.

271
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,380
Yes.

272
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,780
Bi Zhi,

273
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,180
if you don't disable his limbs,

274
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,820
I'll break your wife's.

275
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,700
Bi Zhi!

276
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,700
Stop being their puppet!

277
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,740
Don't mind me!

278
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,420
Bi Zhi is brave.

279
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,820
If the world is divided,

280
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,180
he'll surely have a place.

281
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,260
Sadly...

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,060
Sadly, he's foolish

283
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,020
to be tied down by a woman.

284
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,580
Don't talk like that about him.

285
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,540
Fool!

286
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,140
If you don't do it,

287
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,820
I'll push her down!

288
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,780
Do it!

289
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,900
I'll push her down!

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,420
Bi Zhi!

291
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,780
Bi Zhi, stop fighting!

292
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,300
Because in this world,

293
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,460
no one says we must always do
the right thing.

294
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,300
Manman.

295
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,220
I'd die for you

296
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,300
because you're my dearest cousin.

297
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,460
But I can't

298
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,980
ask Bi Zhi to die for you.

299
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,900
I can't use love to force him

300
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,100
to protect my family,

301
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,260
even you.

302
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,100
I won't regret it.

303
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,660
I can't use love to force him

304
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,420
and make him die

305
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,540
for my family

306
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,220
or even me.

307
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,360
The only person I want to protect

308
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,300
has always been just you.

309
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,300
I will never regret it.

310
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,020
Bi Zhi!

311
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,860
You're my lover,

312
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,420
not a beast to be controlled.

313
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,580
Darling,

314
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,780
if you ever

315
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,220
think back on today,

316
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,780
just remember:

317
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,500
I never regret it.

318
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
Don't jump!

319
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,540
Fan...

320
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,500
Fan...

321
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,420
Fan...

322
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,020
Fan...

323
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,300
Fan, wake up.

324
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,660
I don't want to be some commander.

325
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,900
Fan,

326
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,460
don't die.

327
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,820
Please don't die.

328
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,180
If you die,

329
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,500
what should Li and I do?

330
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,980
As long as you come back,

331
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,660
I'll do anything.

332
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,460
Fan!

333
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,020
Fan!

334
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,420
Fan!

335
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Liu Yan,

336
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
I will make you

337
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,500
pay in blood!

338
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,900
I thought you could hold on longer,

339
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,140
but it seems you're useless after all.

340
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,220
So what if you two join forces?

341
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,060
I have tens of thousands of troops here.

342
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,380
That's more than enough

343
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,860
to handle you.

344
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,660
Xue Tai is dead.

345
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,540
Liangya is defeated.

346
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,020
Everyone, run for your lives!

347
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,700
Retreat!

348
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,660
Run!

349
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,900
- Retreat!
- Run!

350
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,900
Hurry, move faster!

351
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,460
- She's coming back!
- Yes!

352
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Hurry. There's also this.

353
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,460
Pack this up.

354
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,460
You want to betray me too?

355
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
We outnumber her.

356
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,780
No need to fear her.

357
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,340
Xue Tai is dead.

358
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,660
No one can protect her now.

359
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,820
Let's go

360
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,780
and kill her.

361
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,860
What are you doing?

362
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,020
How dare you!

363
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,300
What are you doing?

364
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,980
What are you doing?

365
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,980
She's really disfigured!

366
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,140
She's disfigured!

367
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,220
Your face...

368
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,540
Your face is ruined!

369
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,580
She's really disfigured!

370
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,820
You've all seen it.

371
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,700
Don't expect to live.

372
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,300
None of you can survive.

373
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,660
Be careful!

374
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,380
Don't kill me.

375
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,780
Lady Yulou.

376
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,620
Lady Yulou...

377
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,580
Why?

378
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,580
You've seen

379
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,940
my face.

380
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,940
I'm here to escort you away.

381
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,820
No need.

382
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
No need.

383
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,780
If Liu Yan knew

384
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,740
I looked like this now...

385
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,980
The Lord already knows.

386
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,260
Lady Yulou,

387
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,500
everything you eat, wear,

388
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,940
and use in Liangya

389
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,860
was arranged by the Lord.

390
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
How long

391
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,180
could you have kept it a secret?

392
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
The Lord said

393
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,780
if we lost this battle,

394
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,260
I should escort you to a safe place.

395
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,660
He's arranged an escape for you.

396
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,180
You...

397
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Impossible.

398
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,940
You said no one in this world
cared for you,

399
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,620
but my brother loved you.

400
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,700
Impossible.

401
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,060
He cherished you.

402
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,580
When he was dying,

403
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,340
he entrusted me to take care of you.

404
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,940
Chen Xiang

405
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
truly cared for you.

406
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
He built you a tall tower

407
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,420
and indulged you
in seeking profits for Wushan.

408
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,500
Impossible.

409
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,340
Liu Yan's love for me can't be real.

410
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,420
You ignore all these acts

411
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,500
of kindness.

412
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,900
Instead of blaming the world
for being unfair,

413
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,740
you should think about why you ignore

414
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,500
and shut out the care of others.

415
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:00,993
It's over.

We've won

427
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,580
this battle.

428
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,900
We've won.

429
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,740
Well done.

430
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,580
(May the Lord win.)

431
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,980
Kill them!

432
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,340
Kill them!

433
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,220
Hold the flanks.

434
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,060
Don't let them climb up.

435
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,900
Yes.

436
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
My Lord.

437
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,420
Bi Zhi and Wei Shao have gone mad.

438
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,340
This place isn't safe.

439
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,620
You should retreat to the rear.

440
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,700
What?

441
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,360
Do you think my army is weaker
than Wei Shao's?

442
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,700
No.

443
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,060
We outnumber Wei Shao's forces

444
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,380
by several times.

445
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,540
Even facing him head-on,

446
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm not afraid.

447
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,660
Of course, you're not afraid.

448
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,900
But you needn't get hurt over this.

449
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,660
If you hadn't sent 5,000 guards

450
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,380
and General Liu Xiao
to protect the Lady,

451
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,700
I wouldn't be this worried.

452
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,100
You don't want me to favor the Lady?

453
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,580
Women pampered grow arrogant.

454
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,900
Please listen to my advice.

455
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,740
Shut up.

456
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,860
I swore to the Lady

457
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,300
that I'd kill Wei Shao in this battle.

458
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,900
Foolish.

459
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,780
Whoever conquers the world

460
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,540
cannot be controlled by a woman.

461
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
- Guards!
- Yes!

462
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,380
Take the Lord away.

463
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
Move aside!

464
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,100
I told you

465
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,860
that my uncle is dead.

466
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,980
If you can't accept that,

467
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,540
then go die.

468
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,180
If I kill Wei Shao,

469
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,100
the realm will be mine.

470
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,900
I'll be the Lord of Central Plains.

471
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,500
Soldiers of Wei are fierce.

472
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,740
Wei Shao,

473
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,380
even if you kill me,

474
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,380
Wei will still drown in floods.

475
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,380
You can't win against me.

476
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,260
You can't win!

477
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
My Lady,

478
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,900
I have broken my promise.

479
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,980
When all states prosper,

480
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,380
the world will have peace.

481
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,120
The water from the Yang River
is accessible

482
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,280
thanks to the Yongning Canal,

483
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,300
which runs

484
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,780
over 700 li,

485
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,260
chasing the sun across the sky.

486
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,460
The mighty stag

487
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,300
leaves north and goes south

488
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,860
straight to Yujun.

489
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,540
The mountains and rivers
stretch across the world,

490
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,980
nurturing all living things.

491
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,740
It's misty, yet there's no smoke.

492
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,660
With the sun and moon reflecting in it,

493
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,660
the spiritual energy from all directions

494
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,180
gathers on Central Plains,

495
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,860
turning swords and blades

496
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,140
to dust.

497
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,380
The canal links nine states.

498
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,700
It starts at Panyi,

499
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,460
goes through Xindu,

500
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,300
and stops at Rongjun,

501
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,380
improving the traffic condition,

502
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,300
encouraging peace,
and driving away the spiteful.

503
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,820
The next year after the completion,

504
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,340
Wei Shao, Lord of Wei,

505
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,940
and Liu Yan, Lord of Liangya,

506
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,340
fought here.

507
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,540
Scattered scars

508
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,700
were lost in the long river.

509
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,620
Good.

510
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,700
Master Zhenshi,

511
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,500
this poetic exposition

512
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,940
is a masterpiece.

513
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,660
But the 700 li

514
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,580
was from Panyi to Xindu.

515
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,580
Now that it reaches Rongjun,

516
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,060
it's probably over 2,000 li.

517
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,490
Not to mention

518
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,220
the full length to other states.

519
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,660
My Lord, if you're not satisfied,

520
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,340
shall I write another exposition

521
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,140
detailing the battle at Panyi that day?

522
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,220
No need.

523
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,100
These two lines

524
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,140
are enough.

525
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,260
Your exposition is so excellent

526
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,180
that deserves to be carved
on stone tablets.

527
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,580
But many things

528
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,460
shouldn't be depicted in detail.

529
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,900
No matter how fierce the war was,

530
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,900
people tend to remember

531
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,300
the beautiful memories

532
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,860
and those they truly liked.

533
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,620
How wise and insightful.

534
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,980
Your words make sense.

535
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Tomorrow,

536
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,100
we'll offer the deer as a gift

537
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,660
to honor Wei as the leader.

538
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,300
My Lord,

539
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,260
please don't refuse.

540
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,260
We'll honor Wei as the leader.

541
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,740
Alright.

542
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,620
I won't fail your trust.

543
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,780
I will lead the people

544
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,500
and create lasting peace.

(Yujun)

547
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,940
I heard

548
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,420
Chen Pang failed to bring Mr. Wei

549
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,980
back to his family before he died.

550
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,460
It's a pity

551
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,780
he died of asthma.

552
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,700
That was mercy for him.

553
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,020
Shiyuan is now the Lord of Bianzhou.

554
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,700
Don't mention

555
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,500
these things again.

556
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,140
Yes.

557
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,420
Whoa.

558
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,420
Grandmother.

559
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,420
Shiyuan.

560
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,020
Congratulations on the succession.

561
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,260
May Bianzhou and Wei

562
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,780
remain forever friendly

563
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,900
and share eternal peace.

we brought good wine

I'm the one bringing the orchid

to propose to you.

608
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,740

these little weapons

613
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,100
represent us.

614
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,580
We weren't born on the same day

615
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,340
and probably

616
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,580
won't die on the same day.

617
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,100
But one day,

618
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,860
if we're all gone,

619
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
with these weapons buried together,

620
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,620
we'll always be brothers.

621
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,700
Seeing it

622
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,740
will be like seeing me.

623
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,340
Is this a sign

624
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,860
to stop fighting?

625
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,060
How did you manage to say that
in such a circumstance?

626
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,740
Sir.

627
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,700
Has the Lord been found?

628
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,840
He's not at the office.

629
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,060
Sir.

630
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,360
Not the training ground.

631

Sir.

632
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,580
Lady Xu also said

633
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,620
she hadn't seen the Lord.

634
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,200
The deer offering ritual
is about to start.

635
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,900
Without the Lord,

636
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,220
how can the ritual be completed?

637
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,060
Go fetch Lady Xu.

638
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,300
Only she can accept the deer

639
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,580
on behalf of the Lord.

640
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,900
- Hurry.
- Yes.

641
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,500
Don't cry.

642
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Stop crying.

643
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,500
Don't cry.

644
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,380

645
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,940
Mr. Gongsun couldn't find you

646
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,420
and brought Grandmother there.

647
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,300
- Why are you here?
- Well.

648
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,580
Feifei has been crying nonstop.

649
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,780
I couldn't go.

650
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,700
Alright.

651
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Good girl.

652
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,540
Come on.

653
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,260
Go to your mother.

654
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,180
Don't cry.

655
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,220
You're amazing.

662
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,740
(can be understood another way.)

663

(Whether it's to live a life)

664
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,060
(or conquer the world,)

665
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,940
(both sides working together)

666
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,900

668

669
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,740

my lifelong wish come true)
