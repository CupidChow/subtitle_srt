29

=Episode 31=

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,580
Xiaotao told me to go to Liancheng,

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,060
saying Manman went to Boya

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,460
to seek reinforcements for you.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,260
I thought she was bluffing.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,780
Manman and His Lordship

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,820
share a deep affection.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,000
Xiaotao even asked

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Young Master Ci to help me for my sake.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,220
Her Ladyship is even more
thoughtful and loyal.

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,260
She went to the front lines,

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,570
lending His Lordship her strength.

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,300
Although Boya's reinforcements

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,780
arrived a bit late,

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,940
I'm sure

44
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,780
there's a reason for the delay.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,820
Thoughtful and loyal? You say?

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,900
She only cares about her Yanzhou.

47
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,700
Enough.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,540
You go rest with the main troops.

49
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,020
Later, I'll head upstream

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,580
of the Yang River

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
to do a patrol

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,460
and see if Liu Yan's remnants

53
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,620
are still causing trouble.

54
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm going too.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,500
Me too.

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,100
I want to go to Kangjun to see Xiaotao.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,500
I didn't say
I was going to see the Lady.

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,460
I'm just doing a routine patrol.

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,540
Then you go. I'm not going.

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,740
Since Manman and the Lord are both here,

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,620
why don't we return to Kangjun together?

62
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,260
Return to Kangjun together?

63
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,140
Yes.

64
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,500
Panyi was originally Yanzhou's gateway.

65
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,740
It was later given to Wei,

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,540
so Liancheng became the gateway.

67
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,780
If we go upstream from Panyi,

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,020
we'll reach Kangjun directly.

69
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
Manman has been away
from home for a year.

70
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,660
Father, Uncle, and Aunt

71
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,140
all miss her dearly.

72
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,540
May Yanzhou enjoy peace and prosperity.

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,300
May Uncle and Aunt all the best.

74
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,860
May Father be healthy.

75
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,700
May Ci excel in her studies.

76
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,340
May Cousin and Bi Zhi grow old together.

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,780
I know you're upset

78
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,380
because you believe you love me more.

79
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,020
But that's because
you wrote down a wish,

80
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,060
and I wrote down a regret.

81
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,700
You're right in front of me

82
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,380
within reach,

83
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,340
but I can only send my blessings
to my family from afar.

84
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,500
That's why I only wrote about my family

85
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,020
and didn't mention you.

86
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,440
My Lord, Manman and you
have been married for so long,

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,860
yet you haven't met our family, right?

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,060
Sir, are you feeling unwell?

89
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,380
We still have the prescription

90
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,580
that once helped Grandfather.

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,780
Let's go home

92
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,700
so you can try it.

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
No need.

94
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,660
I'm fine now.

95
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,420
Lady Xu and Lady Zhu

96
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,540
must miss the Lord dearly.

97
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,100
It's best to return to Yujun soon.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,940
Forget it. I'm not going either.

99
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,820
I need to prepare to propose at home.

100
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,200
We can't make this trip.

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,200
After fighting for days,

102
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,120
the soldiers just want to go home early.

103
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,860
I feel the same.

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
Ci is right.

105
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,740
Here's what we'll do.

106
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,880
Tomorrow,

107
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,220
you go pick up your sister

108
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,260
and return home with her.

109
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,620
What about you?

110
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,740
With you and the Boya soldiers
escorting her,

111
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,100
I can rest easy.

112
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Promise me

113
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,120
you'll take good care of your sister.

114
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,380
When she's had enough fun,

115
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,500
send her

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,380
to the Wei border.

117
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,900
I'll be waiting for her there.

118
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,740
I need to go home too.

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
My family is waiting for me.

120
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,500
Alright, rest early tonight.

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
We set out tomorrow.

122
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

123
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,660
You have your family to see,

124
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,540
and I have mine

125
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,060
that can't be forgotten.

126
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,340
So, is the Lord

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,500
really homesick?

128
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,740
Are you stupid?

129
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,620
Did you forget what the Lord
once said in Xindu?

130
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,540
You stuffed my ears back then.

131
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,780
How would I know that?

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,620
Fine.

133
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,060
Back in Xindu, the Lord swore

134
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,700
that one day,

135
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
he would reach Kangjun

136
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,920
and kill the traitor.

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,900
Wipe out the Qiao Clan.

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,040
Burn their ancestral shrine.

139
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
And end their bloodline.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,980
So,

141
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,500
the Lord can't go to Kangjun.

142
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,260
But I want to go see Xiaotao in Kangjun.

143
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,540
It's true.

144
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,860
How about this?

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,460
I'll go ask the Lord

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,340
if I can escort the Lady home.

147
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,660
It's settled then.

148
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,240
Just come back.

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,380
Wait, what are you two doing?

150
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,160
- Going to bed.
- I'm looking for the Lord.

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,320
Don't think about it.

152
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,940
- I want to see Xiaotao.
- The Lord needs rest.

153
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,620
(Wei)
Be good. Let's go.

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,060
Let go of me.

155
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,620
(Boya)

156
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,980
The people came to thank us
on behalf of their families,

157
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,920
but the Yanzhou woman who benefited most

158
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,200
didn't show up.

159
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,580
We risked our lives

160
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,540
for her homeland,

161
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,700
and now we're right here,

162
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,260
but she won't even come out to meet us.

163
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,620
How disappointing.

164
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,060
Who's disappointed?

165
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,460
Stop talking nonsense.

166
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,260
My Lord,

167
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,820
I meant Xiaotao.

168
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,220
She's in Kangjun,
yet she didn't come and see me.

169
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,820
Why are you mad?

170
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,180
My Lord, Boya is just ahead.

171
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,280
Shall we go in and visit?

172
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,460
No need.

173
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,380
Since the Lady brought

174
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,660
the Boya reinforcements with her,

175
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,800
the Commander of Boya Forces
must've gone with her.

176
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,300
Without the host,

177
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,060
we shouldn't disturb them.

178
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
My Lord,

179
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,580
it was

180
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,780
right in this forest.

181
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,860
I saw it with my own eyes.

182
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,820
The Commander of Boya Forces
is terribly strong.

183
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,700
He took down

184
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,500
a live deer

185
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,860
with a single punch,

186
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,380
threw it over his shoulder,
and brought it over.

187
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,980
- General.
- General.

188
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,820
Why are you here?

189
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,080
My Lord, this is General Bi Zhi,

190
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,220
the Commander of Boya Forces.

191
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,140
General,

192
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,420
this is the Lord of Wei.

193
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,260
My Lord.

194
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,460
You didn't personally lead troops

195
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,660
to fight at Panyi?

196
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,820
Why should I?

197
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,980
You don't know
about the battle in Panyi?

198
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,900
Without reinforcements,

199
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
how was the Lady supposed
to turn things around?

200
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,140
It's Lady Qiao, the Lady of Wei.

201
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,740
If we capture her,

202
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,860
it'll be a major achievement.

203
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,020
Get ready to cross the river

204
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
to capture Lady Qiao.

205
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,700
Wait.

206
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,980
My Lady, why are you here alone?

207
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,620
Are you trying to face our 20,000 troops

208
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,460
on your own?

209
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,660
I can't,

210
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,780
but the Yang River can.

211
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,460
General.

212
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,980
The river has receded a lot.

213
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,580
We can cross now

214
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,440
and seize her.

215
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,500
What are you waiting for?

216
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
Shut up!

217
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,620
If they've dammed

218
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,260
the river upstream

219
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,620
and are storing water

220
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,300
just waiting for us to cross

221
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,900
so they can flood us,

222
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,180
do you know the consequences?

223
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,220
Well...

224
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,900
Even 50,000 men

225
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,420
could drown here,

226
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,100
let alone our 20,000.

227
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,700
Even if we can't capture her,

228
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,380
the Lord ordered us to support him

229
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
without fail.

230
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,260
Are we going to disobey orders?

231
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,860
Liu Yan seized power unjustly

232
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
by killing his father and brother.

233
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,540
He then forced you to follow him
with an iron fist.

234
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,060
Now, he asked you for reinforcements.

235
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,260
If this mission succeeds,

236
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,620
you might not be rewarded.

237
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,980
But if it fails, you will be punished.

238
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,620
Following a cruel tyrant,

239
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,000
don't you fear being discarded
when you're no longer useful?

240
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,300
My husband, the Lord of Wei,

241
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,260
was helping with canals across the land,

242
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,780
which gave Liu Yan
a chance to start a war.

243
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,900
Following a man

244
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
who is cruel,

245
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,700
unrighteous, disloyal, and unfilial,

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,100
even if you drown here,

247
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,620
the history books will only say

248
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,380
that you perished by heaven's will.

249
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,260
Generals,

250
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,020
do you dare bet your lives and honor

251
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,820
on this with me?

252
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,020
I'll make Liu Qi

253
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
and my younger brother

254
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,500
die

255
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,020
with Father.

256
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,660
The kids are innocent.

257
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,140
Our rear is exposed.

258
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,900
Out of fear of being struck,

259
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,090
we shouldn't advance.

260
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Retreat.

261
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,820
Withdraw!

262
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,420
My Lady.

263
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,380
Are you all right?

264
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,940
I was so worried.

265
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
You can't take such risks again.

266
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,180
Your forces are far fewer
than Liangya's.

267
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,940
If Liu Yan brings reinforcements,

268
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,980
it'll only get worse.

269
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,900
But don't worry, My Lord.

270
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,340
I'll go to Boya
to ask for reinforcements

271
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,460
and guard your rear.

272
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,580
At last,
I've fulfilled my promise to him.

273
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,780
Did Xiaoqiao come?

274
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,140
The Lady did.

275
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,780
But she left the next day.

276
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,700
My Lord, if you came to pick her up,

277
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,620
that's too bad.

278
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,580
She's probably returned to Yujun.

279
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,540
No way.

280
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,860
The intel says

281
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
she's upstream on the Yang River.

282
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,820
If she's returned to Yujun,

283
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,500
then the boat lantern in Panyi...

284
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,740
It must've been put by her.

285
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,980
May my husband be safe

286
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,620
and return unharmed.

287
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,940
Hyah!

288
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,060
General,

289
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,940
when the Lady came to Boya,

290
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,900
did she bring troops?

291
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,860
Fan said she brought many people,

292
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,180
and it must mean

293
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,340
she loved you deeply.

294
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,660
How many did she bring?

295
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,100
A few hundred, maybe.

296
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,020
What?

297
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,580
A few hundred.

298
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,780
Liu Yan has tens of thousands,

299
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,880
and she's going to ambush them
with a few hundred?

300
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,460
The Lady is planning to ambush Liu Yan

301
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,060
with a few hundred
against tens of thousands?

302
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,580
That's no different

303
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,460
from charging solo into a crowd.

304
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,500
It'll be extremely dangerous.

305
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,420
Her courage is admirable.

306
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,000
She came alone to save us,
and now she's gone home alone.

307
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I wonder

308
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,180
what she's feeling right now.

309
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,760
- Deputy.
- Yes.

310
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,960
Take the main force and return.

311
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,260
The rest, follow me. Go.

312
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
Yes.

313
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,500
What about me?

314
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,460
I...

315
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,120
What?

316
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,700
Manman went to the battlefield
to help the Lord of Wei fight?

317
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,700
Fan,

318
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,780
slow down.

319
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,940
I heard it was

320
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,560
to ambush tens of thousands
of Liangya troops.

321
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,460
Was she hurt?

322
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,140
How could she take such a risk?

323
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,740
I don't know.

324
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,020
The Lady probably
wasn't with the troops.

325
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,100
She should have gone

326
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,820
back to Kangjun by now.

327
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,900
The Lord of Wei has gone to chase her.

328
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,980
Fan,

329
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,060
are you all right?

330
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,620
There's something
I've been hiding from you.

331
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,820
(Commander's Mansion)

332
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,460
Do you think

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,620
Manman will be mad at me?

334
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,660
You're her cousin.

335
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,060
How could the Lady

336
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,420
be mad at you?

337
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,020
If she got hurt because of this,

338
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,580
what am I supposed to do?

339
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,380
I want to go back to Kangjun too.

340
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,380
Sure. No problem.

341
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,300
Maybe I've been too willful.

342
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,540
I didn't lend troops to Manman,

343
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
and now I'm forcing you
to come home with me.

344
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,300
Fan,

345
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,020
you're overthinking.

346
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,540
Tomorrow,

347
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,760
we'll head back to Kangjun.

348
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,410
♪When I wake up from my dream♪

349
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,910

♪Then here, we must divide♪

354
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,500
Even if you worry about the Lord,

355
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,980
there's no need for you
to risk yourself on the battlefield.

356
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
This war started

357
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,140
over Yanzhou and Liancheng.

358
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,820
The Lord was already short on troops,

359
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,260
and the army was split in two.

360
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,340
What should have been a sure win

361
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,420
became much more dangerous.

362
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,900
And Boya...

363
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,860
It was even riskier.

364
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,900
In this situation,

365
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,180
I could only give my all

366
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,900
to fight for a chance for the Lord.

367
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,260
How loyal you are to the Lord.

368
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,740
The Lord treats me

369
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,980
the same.

370
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,260
I don't want to fail him.

371
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,660
If I was alone,

372
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,380
I could sacrifice myself

373
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,900
for him like today.

374
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,700
But I have my family

375
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,380
and the people of Yanzhou.

376
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,020
The Lord will surely understand

377
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,580
your intentions someday.

378
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,780
Has Ci been settled?

379
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes.

380
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,500
My Lady,

381
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,420
the rain is getting heavier.

382
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,060
I wonder how annoying

383
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,420
tonight will be.

384
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,340
It hardly rains in Yujun.

385
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,540
I kind of miss it

386
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,980
after returning to Yanzhou.

387
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,460
The Lord probably

388
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,820
went back to Yujun, right?

389
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,820
Don't say that.

390
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Do you think the Lady
doesn't miss the Lord?

391
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,380
She hopes the Lord

392
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,780
could accompany her back this time

393
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,340
to meet her family.

394
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,660
♪Sing a song of longing♪

395
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,020
♪The evening breeze stirs gently♪

396
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,420
My Lady.

397
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,900
The rain is really heavy.

398
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,260
We need to hurry and cross the river,

399
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,980
or the water will rise

400
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,220
and block our way.

401
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,610
♪Uncaring of day or night♪

402
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,070

♪Leaving memories scattered all around♪

409
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,140
Let's hurry then.

410
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,620
If the bridge floods,

411
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,540
we won't get through.

412
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,730
♪I went through a lot
just to have you by my side♪

413

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,260
This is the border of Yanzhou.

416
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,340
Shall we stop by for a visit?

417
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,420
Sail upstream and we'll reach Kangjun.

418
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,220
Then let's meet up with the Lord

419
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,260
(Tea)
and return to Kangjun together.

420
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,820
You've been married for a year.

421
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,700
How could you visit
your maiden home alone?

422
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,580
We're not an ordinary couple.

423
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,780
I'll wait here till tomorrow.

424
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,940
(Tea)

425
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,460
If he wants,

426
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,420
we'll go back together.

427
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,220
If not,

428
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,780
I won't force it.

429
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,580
The bridge ahead is flooded.

430
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,180
You should turn back.

431
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,340
(Inn)

432
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,180
After rushing all this way,

433
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,700
we still missed them.

434
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,940
The bridge has been flooded.

435
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,300
We have no choice

436
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,320
but to stay here tonight.

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,820
We've checked all the inns
near the ferry.

438
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,500
The Lady should have crossed already.

439
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,780
Then we'll stay here tonight

440
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,180
and try the next ferry tomorrow.

441
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,450
- Okay.
- Sir?

442
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,580
- Coming.
- Sir?

443
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,060
- Any rooms?
- Yes.

444
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,540
- Wei Xiao.
- My Lord.

445
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,940
- My Lord.
- Qiao Ci.

446
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,620
Where's the Lady?

447
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,140
My Lord.

448
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,420
I thought you crossed
the bridge already.

449
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,380
No.

450
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,380
It's been raining hard these days.

451
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,660
It's dangerous on the way.

452
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,660
When did you arrive?

453
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,620
We just got here.

454
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,580
Good then.

455
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,300
The Lady and the Lord have met.

456
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,940
But if I want to see Xiaotao,

457
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,500
I have to go to Kangjun.

458
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,780
I did it.

459
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,660
Though I couldn't bring you
reinforcements,

460
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,700
I stopped Liu Yan's men.

461
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,460
How could you take the liberty?

462
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,300
Even if you couldn't get help,

463
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,980
you should've reported to the commander.

464
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,900
Doing this in the military
could get you caned.

465
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,580
Got it?

466
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,060
Did you get hurt?

467
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,700
Yes, it's my fault.

468
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,740
I disobeyed military orders.

469
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,340
In this situation, you should cane me

470
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,420
over a hundred times

471
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,300
when you see me.

472
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,580
Anything less would be lenient, right?

473
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,900
My Lord,

474
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,780
the Lady came to the battlefield

475
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,940
for your sake.

476
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,260
She feared reinforcements
wouldn't arrive

477
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,980
and you'd be wounded in defeat.

478
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,380
These past few days,

479
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,300
she's been missing you constantly.

480
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,100
How could you hurt her feelings now?

481
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,420
My Lord,

482
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,300
you finally see her again.

483
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,140
Can't you say something nice?

484
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
He just doesn't think before speaking.

485
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Oh, please.

486
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,260
Why can't you sing the tune
just learned?

487
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,340
Weren't you reciting

488
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,980
the lyrics just fine on the way here?

489
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,540
Why can't you say something nice?

490
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,780
Is your mouth on fire?

491
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,660
When did the Lord learn to sing?

492
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,780
Enough.

493
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,380
Is that how you speak to the Lord?

494
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,380
Get some rest.

495
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,540
Come on.

496
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,380
Try to be gentler.

497
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,820
Let's go.

498
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,860
The riding's been a torture.

499
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,700
Help me in.

500
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,100
Time to sleep.

501
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,860
Let the Lord think himself.

502
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,340
Why are you here instead of resting

503
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,620
in your own room?

504
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,020
Thank you.

505
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,460
Your stove's not warm enough.

506
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,580
Aren't you cold?

507
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,140
You're cold?

508
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,740
No.

509
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,620
I'm worried

510
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,100
you'll catch a chill at night.

511
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,860
Chunniang went to bring me some bedding.

512
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,100
This quilt looks too thin.

513
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,940
Not good.

514
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,380
There are two quilts.

515
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,420
It's warm enough.

516
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,900
Even two aren't enough.

517
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,980
The fire in my room is much stronger.

518
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,140
Xiaozao went to get firewood.

519
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,260
If you're still cold,

520
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,500
why not send your mighty guards

521
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,860
to chop more wood?

522
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,820
That'll be enough for the entire inn.

523
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,420
I'm cold, okay?

524
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,180
These past few days

525
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,860
have been awful for me.

526
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,580
I was always thinking about you.

527
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,300
When I woke up

528
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,360
in the middle of the night

529
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
and realized you were not there,

530
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
it felt empty.

531
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,620
I've missed you.

532
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Thank you for saving Yanzhou.

533
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,380
Thank you for coming to find me.

534
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,180
The secret path

535
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,100
was my fault.

536
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,100
Let's not bring up the past.

537
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,780
Today,

538
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,100
I also did something wrong.

539
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,900
I acted out of worry.

540
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,140
I had questions to ask you

541
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,540
but didn't know how to start

542
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,220
so I just blurted things out.

543
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,300
I didn't mean to be harsh.

544
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,340
What did you want to ask me?

545
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,660
I wanted to ask:

546
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,980
After being refused reinforcements,

547
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,100
why didn't you return to Yujun?

548
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,420
Why did you go alone to the battlefield

549
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,260
to intercept Liu Yan's troops?

550
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,500
Weren't you afraid?

551
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,180
Of course, I was.

552
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,260
But the man I love
was still out there fighting.

553
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,900
I promised I'd help defend him.

554
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,300
I couldn't go back on that.

555
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,820
I love him.

556
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,700
I'd give everything for him.

557
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,220
If he wins, I'll be there beside him.

558
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,620
If he loses, I'll fall with him.

559
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,860
I didn't want him to think
I'd stopped liking

560
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,420
or loving him.

561
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,100
I understand.

562
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,900
I do.

563
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,220
It's just...

564
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,460
It's just that I couldn't gamble

565
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,420
with my family's safety

566
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,020
or with the lives of Yanzhou's people.

567
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,340
But I wanted him to know

568
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,580
that to me,

569
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,380
he's just as important as they are.

570
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,380
I understand.

571
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,740
It's all my fault.

572
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,740
Manman,

573
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,700
tonight,

574
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,140
there's also something
I want to tell you.

575
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,580
All this time,

576
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,980
I asked you to be honest with me,

577
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
yet I ignored
how hard things were for you.

578
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,460
When I rushed back from Boya

579
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,540
and heard you'd gone
to the battlefield for me,

580
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,620
I finally realized
how torn you must have been.

581
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,100
You did so much for Yanzhou, Wei,

582
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,860
the Qiao Clan, and the Wei Clan,

583
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,860
yet I still didn't understand you.

584
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,420
Even your cousin blamed you.

585
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,740
But the truth is

586
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,740
no one could've done better than you.

587
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,540
With your relationship with me,

588
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,900
no one else could've done better.

589
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,460
You've been caught

590
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,500
between the two clans.

591
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,780
The slightest shift

592
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,660
will hurt you first.

593
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
I've thought

594
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,740
about letting go of my hatred.

595
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,420
I even believed

596
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,580
I had already backed down enough.

597
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,500
But on the day you asked me

598
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
if I would give up revenge,

599
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,980
I suddenly realized

600
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,540
that from the very beginning,

601
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,340
I never gave you any promise,

602
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
and you've lived

603
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,020
under that pressure all along.

604
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,060
When I heard you came to help me,

605
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,420
honestly, I was scared.

606
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,940
I was scared you'd regret it

607
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,100
and you'd think I wasn't worth it.

608
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,020
So, when I turned around
to chase after you,

609
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,760
I kept asking myself
over and over again:

610
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,920
If I were...

611
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,980
If I were

612
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
to lose you...

613
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,980
So what if I wiped out all my enemies?

614
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,340
Even if I won the whole world,

615
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,580
the rest of my life

616
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,820
would be meaningless without you.

617
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,300
I'm a jerk.

618
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,080
You've done so much for me,

619
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,200
and I never knew how to cherish

620
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,220
and love you.

621
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I once told you:

622
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,640
If I ever made you angry,

623
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
you could hit me as much as you like.

624
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,620
Today, I made you sad.

625
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,540
You can hit and curse me,

626
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,740
but don't you dare push me away.

627
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,340
Don't you dare doubt
how I feel about you.

628
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,940
I've never doubted your love,

629
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,360
and you're not allowed to doubt mine.

630
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,580
Hit me.

631
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,580
I'm right

632
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,340
in front of you, right?

633
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,420
Manman.

634
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,660
I'd like

635
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,020
to go with you to Kangjun.

636
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm curious

637
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,220
about where you grew up,

638
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,100
about your family,

639
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,300
and about your people.

640
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,460
Grandmother also told me

641
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,620
to let go of hatred.

642
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,140
So I think

643
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,380
maybe only once I've seen Kangjun

644
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,800
will I truly be able to let go.

645
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,260
You've indeed done so much for me.

646
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,860
That's because

647
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,100
you never left me behind

648
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,820
when danger struck.

649
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,880
♪The moonlight is as silent
as the deep sea♪

650
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,410
♪From afar♪

651
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,510
♪It once lit up dreams with a breath♪

652
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,540
♪But vanished with a sigh♪

653
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,130
♪Brushing past my fingertips♪

654
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,900
♪My heartstrings were stirred quietly♪

655
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,670
♪As if we once met before♪

656
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,270
♪Holding back a love so deep♪

657
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,820
Whoa.

658
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,140
Whoa.

659
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,700
Soldiers!

660
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,380
- Rest here!
- Yes!

661
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
Pass the word!

662
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,320
Rest here!

663
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,780
Rest here!

664
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,660
Rest here!

665
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,700
My Lord.

666
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,020
Please have some water.

667
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,100
My Lord,

668
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,140
in this campaign,

669
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,020
we deployed a total of 100,000 troops.

670
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,050
56,938 of them

671
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,220
are dead.

672
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,100
4,276 of them are wounded.

673
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,220
18,052 of them

674
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,420
ran away.

675
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,620
We still have 36,934.

676
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,900
Among those,

677
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,060
only three generals

678
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,980
and

679
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
five deputy generals

680
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,940
survived.

681
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,340
That's barely one in ten.

682
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,700
My Lord,

683
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,860
please regroup

684
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,780
and strike Panyi again

685
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,180
to avenge our fallen brothers.

686
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,180
My Lord, please don't.

687
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Even with superior numbers,

688
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,860
we still lost this battle.

689
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,220
If we keep charging ahead blindly,

690
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
I fear Liangya

691
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,220
may be wiped out

692
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,540
completely.

693
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,940
We lost this fight

694
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,820
only because Lin fled
in the heat of battle!

695
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,020
If not for that,

696
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,460
our banner might already be flying

697
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,380
over Panyi's city walls.

698
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,100
If we had escaped any slower,

699
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,660
the Wei banner might be planted

700
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,580
on your bones right now.

701
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,140
- You...
- Enough!

702
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,060
My Lord.

703
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,560
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

704
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,140
The subordinates

705
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,660
were already dissatisfied

706
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,020
with your succession.

707
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,620
Now, after such a defeat,

708
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,580
if you continue to act on impulse,

709
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
Liangya

710
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,180
may fall into chaos.

711
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,820
If anyone disobeys,

712
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,940
kill them.

713
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,540
Now is not the time to come on strong.

714
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,220
I think

715
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,620
we should appease

716
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,260
the clansmen and officials.

717
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,560
Once we return,

718
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,540
I am willing to appease

719
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,940
the clansmen and officials

720
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,420
on your behalf.

721
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,180
The Lord doesn't need to show goodwill
to his subordinates.

722
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,900
My Lord, just give the order,

723
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
and I will eliminate them.

724
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,500
Liu Xiao.

725
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,900
Yes.

726
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,660
At Panyi,

727
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,340
the reinforcements were delayed.

728
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,740
General Lin fled the battlefield
with 20,000 soldiers.

729
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,300
I order you to capture him.

730
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,100
If he resists,

731
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,580
kill him.

732
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
Yes.

733
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,980
The rest of the troops

734
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,080
will return with me to Liangya
to rest and recover.

735
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,560
We will pause the fight for now.

736
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
My Lord.

737
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
This...

738
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,780
Any objections?

739
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,660
Yes, My Lord.

740
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,340
My Lord, you're wise.

741
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,500
When we return to Chijun,

742
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,380
I will do my best to help you

743
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,420
appease the clansmen and officials.

744
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,500
However,

745
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,340
you should also show humility

746
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,020
and admit your mistakes

747
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,660
to make them believe you.

748
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,380
After all, you're still young.

749
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,580
Sometimes, you need to listen
to the elders' advice

750
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,060
to avoid detours.

751
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,500
Isn't that right,

752
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,540
My Lord?

753
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,060
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

754
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,060
Young Master Ci is back.

755
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,740
Father.

756
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,620
Uncle.

757
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,460
Aunt.

758
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,420
I brought Manman and the Lord back.

759
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,660
I knew I should wait at home.

760
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,140
The Lady would surely return.

761
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,100
Whoa.

762
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,300
My Lord, your arrival is a great honor.

763
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,540
This is your first visit to Kangjun.

764
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,500
It marks a big step in relations
between Wei and Yanzhou.

765
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,580
We must celebrate it properly.

766
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,980
Why pull me?

767
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,230
Why weren't you looking for me?

768
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,300
Why would I look for you?

769
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,280
- Father, Uncle, Aunt.
- I was looking for Lady.

770
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,620
I'm glad you're back.

771
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,220
I told you

772
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,520
to serve the Lord of Wei.

773
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,460
How could you forget the rules
after leaving us?

774
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,020
You even made him support you.

775
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,380
I wanted to support her myself.

776
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,780
Of course, you can do that if you want.

777
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,820
Manman, that's your fortune.

778
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,580
Father.

779
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,540
I'm glad you're back.

780
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,140
My Lord.

781
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,900
Cousin and Bi Zhi are here.

782
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,220
Fan is back.

783
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,380
Great!

784
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,580
Both my girls have returned.

785
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,340
Today, we celebrate
the arrival of the Lord.

786
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,700
Ignore the others.

787
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,620
We've prepared food and drink at home.

788
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,180
Please follow me.

789
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,180
Father, Mother.

790
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,020
Uncle.

791
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,220
My Lord, rest assured.

792
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,380
Today, you helped me reclaim Liancheng.

793
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,140
If you ever need anything,

794
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,980
Yanzhou will never refuse.

795
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,660
Long time to see.

796
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,900
You are now the Commander
of Boya Forces.

797
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,340
No matter your rank,

798
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,540
if you treat Fan well,

799
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,220
you're family to us.

800
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,860
Uncle.

801
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,660
My Lord, you must be tired
from the journey.

802
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,940
Please come home with me.

803
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,420
Oh, I forgot to thank you that day.

804
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,620
If not for you,

805
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,220
I might not have found the Lady.

806
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,140
Thank you.

807
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,900
No need for this among the family.

808
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,860
Bi Zhi may be from the Qiao Clan,

809
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,940
but...

810
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
The Lady is right.

811
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,500
Bi Zhi.

812
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,340
We're all family.

813
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,620
We've been talking

814
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,780
in the wind for too long.

815
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,740
Let's go home.

816
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,780
Let the Lord of Wei

817
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,060
and Manman rest well.

818
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,500
Cousin is with child
and shouldn't overexert herself.

819
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

820
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,060
My Lord, after you.

821
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,600
With so many people here,

822
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,620
be mindful.

823
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,700
Got it.

824
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,100
My Lord.

825
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,900
The Lord of Wei recognized Bi Zhi

826
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,940
but hasn't accepted you.

827
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,460
Manman,

828
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,260
Bi Zhi is so capable,

829
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,620
and Uncle still dislikes him.

830
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,540
Uncle hasn't improved at all.

831
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,740
If Grandfather knew,

832
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,700
he'd be furious.

833
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,460
Your grandfather didn't teach you
to disrespect elders.

834
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,300
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

835
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,140
These servants served you before,

836
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,380
waiting here to greet you.

837
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,820
Welcome home.

838
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,210
You'll all get awarded.

839
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,740
Thank you, My Lady.

840
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,140
They even made you some snacks

841
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,300
and clothes and socks.

842
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,820
They've been thinking of you.

843
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,940
Aunt,

844
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,300
what did you prepare for me?

845
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Your room is all set up

846
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,140
with the fragrance you liked before.

847
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,340
I remember everything.

848
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,140
The dinner tonight is your favorite too.

849
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,020
Your father arranged it all himself.

850
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,380
(At her maiden home,)

851
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,700
(she's being cared for by others.)

852
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,340
(Everything suits her wishes.)

853
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,380
(But when she first came to my family,)

854
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,360
(she cared for others.)

855
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,520
Mother, please have some tea.

856
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,820
(Everything suited my wishes.)

857
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,660
(I wonder if Manman is tired)

858
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,340
(and if she feels wronged.)

859
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,580
You go walk around with the Lord of Wei.

860
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,260
Make yourself at home.

861
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,380
I'll take your cousin back to rest.

862
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,220
Okay.

863
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,980
Let's go.

864
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,500
Great, I wanted to see

865
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,900
where you lived before.

866
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,060
Let's go.

867
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,340
You can go and see some friends too.

868
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,310
Yes.

869
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,780
That was the main chamber.

870
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,620
This chamber is
where Cousin and I lived.

871
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,740
Yanzhou really is suitable for orchids.

872
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,140
They're everywhere.

873
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,060
It's warmer here than in Yujun,

874
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,580
and the flowers bloom earlier.

875
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,500
There's a pear tree here.

876
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,420
When I was free,

877
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,140
I used to sit under it and drink tea.

878
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,020
I'll take you to see other places.

879
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,540
Manman,

880
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,780
do you blame me?

881
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,260
Why would you say that?

882
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,340
When you were at home,

883
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,620
you were treasured like a jewel.

884
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,420
But in the Wei State,

885
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,980
you're cautious everywhere.

886
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,180
The Wei State

887
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,340
is not a cage,

888
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,860
but for you,

889
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,900
it's no different.

890
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,380
And I've never seen you

891
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,740
so at ease before.

892
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
It's my fault.

893
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,660
You treat me well.

894
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,460
The days with you

895
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,180
are comfortable and happy.

896
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,060
Then it's settled.

897
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,060
Kangjun is your home,

898
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,700
and Yujun

899
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
is also your home.
