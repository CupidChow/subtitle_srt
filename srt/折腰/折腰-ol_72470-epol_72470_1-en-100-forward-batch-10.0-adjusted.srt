=Episode 1=

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,850
Grandfather,

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,980
what kind

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,460
of person is Wei Shao?

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,700
You should know his grandfather first.

34
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,090
When I first became
the Governor of Yanzhou,

35
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,820
I held a Deer Hunt,

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,540
inviting lords

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,980
of various states

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
to a hunting game.

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,700
(Xiaoqiao)
But actually,

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,860
(Qiao Gui's Granddaughter)

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,210
I meant to

42
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,140
make allies.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,250
We were

44
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,580
like old friends from the start.

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,620
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,460
I can never repay you
for bringing us water

47
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,460
through the canal.

48
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,120
(Qiao Gui, Governor of Yanzhou)
Now,

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,460
let these antlers be the tokens

50
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,340
(Wei Lun, Lord of Wei)
of our alliance

51
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,300
with Yanzhou.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,900
Lord Wei...

53
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,740
From now on,

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,780
whoever dares to invade Yanzhou

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,650
will be Wei's enemy.

56
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,860
The Qiao and Wei Clans

57
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,780
will live and die

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,090
together.

59
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,140
As will we.

60
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,780
In the following years,

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,490
I built the Yongning Canal

62
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,490
(Yongning Canal)
between Panyi and Xindu,

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,210
allowing Wei

64
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,490
to have water

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,580
and us to have protection.

66
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,060
(Panorama)
14 years ago,

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,070
Bianzhou sent Li Su

68
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,820
(Wei Bao, 1st Grandson)
to invade Wei

69
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,980
(of Wei Lun)
and seize Xindu

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,820
(14 Years Ago, Xindu, Wei State)

71
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,690
to break our alliance.

72
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,060
Grandfather,

73
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,900
the Qiao Clan sent no one.

74
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,530
They must've turned their backs on us!

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,340
That rat Qiao Gui!

76
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,580
Are you going to drag us

77
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,340
into war for a verbal alliance?

78
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,700
Father,

79
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,780
we've offered Wei enough supplies
over the years

80
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,860
for your friendship with their lord.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,652
We've promised to

82
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,580
(Qiao Yue)
send troops.

83
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,740
(Qiao Gui's 1st Son)
Withdrawing them is

84
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,960
(Qiao Ping, Qiao Gui's 2nd Son)
betrayal!

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,530
We can use a pretext.

86
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,980
Father,

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,860
please make a decision immediately.

88
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,940
(Young Xiaoqiao)

89
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,170
Manman just threw moon blocks

90
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,610
for divination.

91
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,640
This is the will of Heaven.

92
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,210
Withdraw!

93
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,050
Father!

94
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,300
Stop it, Shao.

95
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
(Young Wei Shao)

96
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,420
Shao,

97
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,690
remember,

98
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,730
do not believe anyone.

99
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,050
Grandfather was tricked by the Qiao Clan

100
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,650
and ended up like this.

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,090
You're the Wei Clan's only hope.

102
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,530
Brother, promise me

103
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,780
not to shed tears ever again!

104
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,740
Father!

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,580
This city belongs to Bianzhou now.

106
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,940
It's Chen's.

107
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,730
Throw them into the pit

108
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,140
and bury them with the captives.

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,070
(Li Su, General of Bianzhou)
Kill all men

110
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,380
in Xindu in the next three days!

111
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,220
Yes.

112
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,730
You meant to protect Yanzhou

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,460
from war, didn't you?

114
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,460
To sacrifice one or all?

115
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,580
It would've been hard
for me to choose, too.

116
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,780
Wei Shao and his troops have come

117
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,090
to recapture Xindu from Li Su.

118
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,640
At this point,

119
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,700
if we send our troops to assist Li Su,

120
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,140
Wei Shao might not win.

121
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,090
But if we do nothing,

122
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,780
and he captures Xindu,

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,820
he'll invade Yanzhou next

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,850
and seize Panyi.

125
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,970
What to do then?

126
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,580
The late Lord of Wei's wife,

127
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,530
Lady Xu,

128
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,540
(Lady Xu, Wei Shao's Grandmother)
is far-sighted.

129
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,970
I'd like her approval
for a marriage alliance

130
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,460
to bury the hatchet.

131
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,210
Is it to marry my cousin to Wei Shao?

132
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,970
If such a marriage alliance

133
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,340
can resolve hatred,

134
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,140
that'll be the best.

135
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,460
But Wei Shao saw his grandfather,

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
father, and brother being killed.

137
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,170
We have no idea if he bears

138
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,170
grudges against the Qiao Clan.

139
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,050
I wonder

140
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,020
what exactly he's like.

141
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,220
(Wei Shao, Lord of Wei)

142
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,180
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

143
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,340
Here, toss! Over here!

144
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,460
Toss it over!

145
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,850
- Try and hit me, too.
- Here.

146
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,090
Give me that.

147
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,290
You hit me!

148
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,290
Hit her!

149
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,410
(Daqiao, Qiao Yue's Daughter)

150
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,340
Good. Over here.

151
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,970
- My turn.
- Hit her. Come on!

152
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,820
Stop!

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
Hit me if you can.

154
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,820
Toss it to me.

155
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
(Bi Zhi, Groom)
Catch it!

156
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,170
Wait. Time-out.

157
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,050
Let me try it.

158
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,050
It's my turn.

159
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,250
Manman.

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,910
- Give me that.
- Manman.

161
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,210
Manman,

162
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,940
what's been troubling you lately?

163
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,700
Can't you tell me about it?

164
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,940
Wei Shao

165
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,580
has had Xindu besieged for days.

166
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,780
I wonder how things are there.

167
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,700
You don't seem worried at all.

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
Wei Shao's target is Xindu,

169
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,580
not our city.

170
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,650
Why bother to worry?

171
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,290
Won't he attack us after seizing Xindu?

172
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,660
Will he?

173
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,940
Bi Zhi, toss it over!

174
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
Cousin,

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,740
the only way to keep Yanzhou from war

176
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,160
is to form a marriage alliance.

177
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,330
In that case,

178
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,050
you'll be married to Wei Shao.

179
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,740
Marry me

180
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,020
to Wei Shao?

181
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,140
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

182
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,260
Liangya's heir, Liu Yan,

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,620
came with one of his uncles.

184
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,180
(Xiaozao)
His father sent an envoy

185
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,950
(Xiaoqiao's Maid)
to propose marriage to you.

186
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,220
I'm

187
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,690
the Liangya Royalty's envoy

188
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,930
to propose marriage
with betrothal gifts.

189
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,410
(Liu Shan, Liu Yan's Uncle)
I heard a tale on the way.

190
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,260
I wonder if it was true.

191
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,780
(Liu Yan, Liangya's Heir)
Back then,

192
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,740
when Lord Qiao Yue

193
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,780
(Lady Ding)
married you, Lady Ding,

194
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,400
(Qiao Yue's Wife)
your dowry

195
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,570
was worth 10,000 taels of gold.

196
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,900
It spread for miles on the streets.

197
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,980
If our heir is to marry

198
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,690
Miss Xiaoqiao,

199
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,700
Governor,

200
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,380
will her dowry include a fief?

201
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,650
Uncle...

202
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,770
Young Master,

203
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,170
once Wei Shao seizes Xindu,

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,720
Yanzhou will be in danger.

205
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,780
You probably don't know

206
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,090
that my father and Lady Xu

207
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,220
of the Wei Clan of Wei have agreed

208
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,080
to marry my daughter, Daqiao,
to the Lord of Wei.

209
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,440
He'll be my son-in-law.

210
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,700
If Young Master Liu
marries my niece, Xiaoqiao,

211
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,050
you and the Lord of Wei
will be in-laws, too.

212
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,260
How could we be in danger?

213
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,580
Uncle,

214
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,760
I struggled in misery in childhood.

215
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,260
I couldn't have come this far
without you two's help.

216
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Cousin Xiaoqiao and I

217
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,570
grew up together.

218
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,290
See?

219
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,740
Our heir has always been

220
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,170
grateful and loyal.

221
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,860
In this case,

222
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,530
how about we

223
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,140
set the wedding date today

224
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,780
for these childhood sweethearts?

225
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,860
Here.

226
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
I toast you all.

227
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,450
The Liangya Royalty's betrothal gifts

228
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,980
for their heir, Liu Yan,

229
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,290
include a pair of wild geese,

230
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,930
one million coppers,

231
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,260
ten duan of silk,

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,930
twelve hu of baijiu,

233
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,740
twelve hu of rice,

234
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,410
twelve hu of proso millet,

235
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,860
two sheepskins,

236
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,890
and a lynx.

237
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,260
Lynx?

238
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,870
(Xiaotao, Xiaoqiao's Maid)
It's more like a weasel.

239
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
It is a weasel.

240
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,860
You probably don't know

241
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,290
how hard it is to get a lynx.

242
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,620
We didn't have time to hunt

243
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,860
while rushing all the way here.

244
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,170
Besides,

245
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,930
don't most families use weasels?

246
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,530
We aren't any family.

247
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
Yes.

248
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,690
Sure.

249
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,260
How's everything, Uncle?

250
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,500
Offering them a weasel is good enough.

251
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,930
A lynx is hard to come by.

252
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,170
Manman,

253
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,740
Liu Yan's feelings for you

254
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,900
matter more than such formalities.

255
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,900
You've been bonded since childhood,

256
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,810
unlike your cousin,

257
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,260
who'll be married into a deathtrap.

258
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,540
(Wei Liang, General of Wei)

259
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,580
(Wei Qu, General of Wei)

260
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,100
(Wei Xiao, General of Wei)

261
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,420
(Wei Duo, General of Wei)

262
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
Guys,

263
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,210
shall we eat or not?

264
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,980
Cut it! I'm starving!

265
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,130
Hurry!

266
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,170
Have a bite.

267
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,290
Add seasoning.

268
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,570
Lord, our feet are itchy

269
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,980
when we can't fight.

270
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,300
Xindu is right ahead.

271
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,960
Can't we charge into it?

272
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,930
Or do you think we can't?

273
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,780
Besiegement is better than attack.

274
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,030
The Central Plains always

275
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,930
struggle with drought.

276
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,730
Li Su doesn't have enough provisions.

277
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,050
We can

278
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,330
seize Xindu without battle.

279
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,530
Be patient.

280
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,330
What are you doing?

281
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,220
They lack food, don't they?

282
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
I'm letting them know

283
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,410
that not only do we have food

284
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,530
but we also have meat to eat.

285
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,030
Lord.

286
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,890
Advisor.

287
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,290
- Advisor.
- Advisor.

288
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,280
(Gongsun Yang)

289
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,420
(Wei Shao's Advisor)
Lord.

290
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,500
Lady Xu sent a letter.

291
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,780
What did my grandmother say?

292
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,290
She meant to

293
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,290
marry a girl to you.

294
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,050
I had sworn to my grandfather

295
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,210
to kill Li Su and the Qiao Clan.

296
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,530
I won't marry anyone

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,670
until I take my revenge.

298
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,010
Yes.

299
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,340
Whisper to me.

300
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
Who did Lady Xu pick

301
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,060
to marry our lord?

302
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,300
What does she look like?

303
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,700
Let's see it! Come on!

304
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,580
Qiao of the Qiao Clan.

305
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,500
Qiao of the Qiao Clan?

306
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,540
(Mr. Gongsun,)
Calm down.

307
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,440
(We can resolve hatred)

308
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,780
(by marriage.)
Think about it.

309
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,140
After seizing all those cities

310
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,500
and getting to Xindu,
our troops need to rest.

311
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,260
Were we sandwiched
by Qiao's and Li Su's troops,

312
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,340
we might be in grave peril.

313
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,460
How dare

314
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,580
those traitors push my grandmother!

315
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,740
If I

316
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
seize Xindu now,

317
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
she'll have

318
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,580
nothing to worry about, right?

319
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,380
Guys,

320
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,980
move it!

321
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
Lord!

322
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,940
Lord!

323
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,300
A reckless raid is likely to fail!

324
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,780
Yah.

325
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,100
(Wei)
Yah.

326
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,380
14 years ago,

327
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,340
the Qiao Clan betrayed our family,

328
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,060
causing them to be killed

329
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,660
and Xindu to be captured.

330
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,220
The enemy is

331
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,900
right in front of us.

332
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,140
Everyone,

333
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,860
let's go

334
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,340
to kill Li Su

335
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,660
and the Qiao Clan!

336
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,980
Kill Li Su

337
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,060
and the Qiao Clan!

338
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Kill Li Su

339
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,220
and the Qiao Clan!

340
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Kill Li Su

341
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,340
and the Qiao Clan!

342
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Kill Li Su

343
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,460
and the Qiao Clan!

344
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,540
(Xindu)
Kill Li Su

345
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,810
and the Qiao Clan!

346
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,980
Kill Li Su

347
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,010
and the Qiao Clan!

348
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
Let's go!

349
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,100
Wei Shao, you brat!

350
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,220
I'll kill you!

351
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,780
Yah.

352
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,660
Yah.

353
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,260
Yah.

354
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,780
(This scene is required by the plot.
Do not imitate. Be kind to animals.)

355
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,500
Charge!

356
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
(Xindu)

357
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,540
(Qiao Mansion)

358
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
Manman,

359
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
don't worry.

360
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,740
Yanzhou is your home.

361
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
Once Wei Shao and I marry,

362
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,340
Liangya will treat you

363
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,540
with great respect.

364
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,780
Fan.

365
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,220
As much as I hate to marry Wei Shao,

366
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,660
I can't elope with you either.

367
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,980
Bi Zhi,

368
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,180
we'll have to part soon.

369
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,900
Wei Shao...

370
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,060
I'll challenge him to a duel

371
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,220
to stop him from marrying you.

372
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,220
A mere groom like you

373
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,660
isn't his match.

374
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,700
You're up.

375
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,100
I can't sleep.

376
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,180
I have something to discuss with you.

377
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,260
What is it?

378
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,680
After the New Year,

379
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,260
Chunniang and I

380
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,580
used our spare time

381
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,260
to sew this wedding gown for you.

382
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,300
Now that Wei Shao and I
are engaged in haste,

383
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,460
I'll leave before you.

384
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,500
May I

385
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,100
wear this instead?

386
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,620
Both of us are getting married.

387
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,380
How come

388
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,820
your dowry is more than mine?

389
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,220
I'll tell my mother

390
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,860
to give you more.

391
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,310
Or take whatever you like

392
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,420
from my dowry.

393
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,740
I'm not competing with you.

394
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,700
It's just that

395
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,820
once we part,

396
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,940
we're unlikely to meet again.

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,140
I'd like to keep something you value

398
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,180
as a memento.

399
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,280
Whenever I miss you,

400
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,550
I can look at it for comfort.

401
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,540
Don't you want these clothes?

402
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,380
Here you go.

403
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,220
Anything else?

404
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,180
These are yours, too.

405
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,420
Is there more?

406
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,020
I sewed this myself.

407
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,220
I haven't worn it yet.

408
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,580
What else?

409
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,820
I mean,

410
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,020
by giving me

411
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,260
those things you cherish,

412
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,580
you can show how much you love me.

413
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,460
No, not that one.

414
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,700
Trust me.

415
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,580
I'll keep

416
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,740
all these safe.

417
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,020
I'll give you

418
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,500
whatever you want

419
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,020
as long as

420
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,980
you'll live happily with your husband.

421
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,540
As will you.

422
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,220
Between the two of us,

423
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
if you can

424
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,660
have a happy marriage,

425
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,420
that'll be enough.

426
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,100
Between the two of us,

427
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,700
if one can have a happy marriage,

428
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,540
that'll be enough.

429
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,460
Get changed.

430
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,500
I'll take you to a place.

431
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,260
Manman,

432
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,100
- where are we going?
- Hurry!

433
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,860
Manman, what...

434
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,020
what are you doing?

435
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,580
If you truly love him,

436
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,220
then go with him.

437
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,460
I can't.

438
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,580
You have to.

439
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
If you married Wei Shao,

440
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,300
your life would be ruined.

441
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,020
I'm the Governor's daughter.

442
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,820
I've been supported by our people.

443
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,060
It's time for me to take responsibility.

444
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,860
If I say

445
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,220
I'll marry Wei Shao instead,

446
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
will you allow it?

447
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,660
You can't!

448
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,140
- He...
- He's the worst. I know.

449
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,340
Listen,

450
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,500
women's marriage can only go two ways.

451
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,300
One is yours

452
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,860
to grow old with your love

453
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,660
and lead a normal life.

454
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,780
The other is mine.

455
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,300
I don't need my husband's sweet love

456
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,180
but his status and power.

457
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,740
I used to like Young Master Liu,

458
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,660
but now, I realize

459
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,700
he doesn't deserve me.

460
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,900
He looks down on Yanzhou

461
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,820
and me for fear of Wei Shao.

462
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,740
In that case,

463
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,260
why don't I marry Wei Shao

464
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,100
to make the Liu Clan of Liangya

465
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,020
bow to me?

466
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,860
If you didn't hide anything,

467
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,140
you must've given me

468
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,940
all your valuable things.

469
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,260
Your konghou is too heavy.

470
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,260
I took off its strings for you.

471
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,180
You won't blame me, will you?

472
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,060
Manman, you...

473
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,940
Manman!

474
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,340
Manman...

475
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,290
Sit tight.

476
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,220
I'm helping her elope with you

477
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,700
to keep her from harm's way.

478
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,140
But if I find out you mistreat her,

479
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,780
I'll hunt you down for sure.

480
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,740
If you do love her wholeheartedly,

481
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,660
when the time's right,

482
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,180
I'll put in a good word to her parents

483
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,220
and help you rise.

484
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,860
Miss, if you need my help in the future,

485
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,220
I, Bi Zhi, will go through fire

486
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,420
and water for you!

487
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Manman!

488
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,380
Set out now

489
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
before it's too late.

490
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
Manman!

491
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,060
Manman!

492
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,020
Bi Zhi.

493
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,580
Manman!

494
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,580
Manman!

495
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,140
She's unsophisticated.

496
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,180
Leaving with Bi Zhi is

497
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,900
much better than

498
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,020
marrying the Lord of Wei

499
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,060
only to be torn to pieces.

500
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,580
Miss,

501
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,740
what are you going to do next?

502
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,780
Check the stable again. Go!

503
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,010
- Yes.
- What about her room?

504
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,890
- Not yet.
- My Lady!

505
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,100
- Go now!
- Yes.

506
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,900
Miss Daqiao left a letter.

507
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,100
What happened?

508
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,980
Where's she?

509
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Where's she?

510
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,460
Darling.

511
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,220
(Farewell, Mother. Do take care.)

512
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,620
What to do?

513
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,540
Without Fan,
who will marry the Lord of Wei?

514
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,420
The Letter of Marriage has been sent.

515
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,340
Lady Xu has given her approval.

516
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
If the Lord of Wei

517
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,150
attacks us for the breach,

518
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,140
what... what should we do?

519
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,660
(Zhang Pu, Qiao Yue's Aide)
We'll fight to the end!

520
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,260
Ci,

521
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,220
look at our clansmen.

522
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,780
Can any of them fight?

523
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
I suggest

524
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,940
we send Zhang Pu to Xindu

525
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,140
to tell the Lord of Wei the truth

526
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
and make an apology.

527
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,780
What? I can't handle

528
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,100
the wrath of the Lord of Wei.

529
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,940
Tell him...

530
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,540
tell him Fan was abducted

531
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,780
on her way to...

532
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,060
the temple!

533
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,220
That's a terrible idea, Lord!

534
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,820
Wei's troops are formidable.

535
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,620
I can't go there alone.

536
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,730
It's the jaws of death, Lord!

537
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,960
Lord, I have a solution.

538
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,260
Say it.

539
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,620
Now that Miss Daqiao is gone,

540
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,340
why not...?

541
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,820
Do you... mean

542
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,900
to marry Manman to him?

543
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,260
Brilliant!

544
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,540
- Darling.
- Nonsense!

545
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,580
Are you out of your mind?

546
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,780
Good.

547
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,140
That's perfect.

548
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,100
She and Liu Yan have engaged.

549
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,580
Wei is strong while Liangya is weak.

550
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,380
We can't afford to annoy Wei,

551
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,220
or we'll meet our doom!

552
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,580
Brother,

553
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,300
don't you know Wei Shao?

554
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,180
If we marry Manman to him,

555
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,900
won't we be pushing her off the cliff?

556
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,340
Do you have a better idea?

557
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,340
The priority is

558
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,580
to find Fan and bring her back.

559
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,580
Fate can't be avoided.

560
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,380
(Xindu, Wei State)

561
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,900
14 years ago,

562
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,620
I ordered a three-day massacre,

563
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,540
yet you managed to survive.

564
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,620
Are you curious

565
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,980
about how I escaped death?

566
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,140
Back then,

567
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,940
I killed your grandfather, father,

568
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,900
and brother.

569
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,700
Too bad,

570
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,940
I only have one life.

571
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,260
It's worth it!

572
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,860
Really!

573
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,740
Lord, what should we do with him?

574
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,680
Kill him.

575
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,380
That's too easy for him.

576
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,260
Throw his pieces into a case.

577
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,500
Stop!

578
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,620
Lord,

579
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,340
don't kill him!

580
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,450
Advisor.

581
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,300
Chopped and done.

582
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,660
(People's Wall)

583
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,620
That was reckless, Lord.

584
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,220
Everyone knows the feud
between you and him.

585
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,700
If you kept Li Su alive,

586
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
you'd gain public support.

587
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,860
What could that do?

588
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,780
Li Su must die.

589
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,740
Although you've seized Xindu,

590
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,860
restoring it

591
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
requires people's help.

592
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,420
14 years ago,

593
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,060
after the massacre by Li Su,

594
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,580
the old and young left

595
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,660
built this wall
with their families' belongings

596
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,620
to honor the deceased.

597
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,380
It's been so long.

598
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,380
The war has taken a heavy toll on them.

599
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,420
- A wedding at this time can...
- I know.

600
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,860
You want me

601
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,420
to get married

602
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
for the greater good, right?

603
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,940
Lord,

604
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,100
our troops have to recuperate now.

605
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,140
No further action shall be taken.

606
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,900
I disagree with you.

607
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,780
It's better to press on

608
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,540
to seize Panyi.

609
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,300
Manman,

610
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,540
you grew up under my watch.

611
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,460
With your intelligence,

612
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,180
you may or may not go far,

613
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,580
but you can at least protect yourself.

614
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,100
Grandfather,

615
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,180
I'm thinking

616
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,580
that to make the Lord of Wei

617
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,820
ally himself with us as I wish,

618
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,620
we need to find out

619
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,780
what he wants from me.

620
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,700
Panyi is

621
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,380
the gateway of Yanzhou

622
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,860
crisscrossed with rivers.

623
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,660
If Wei Shao means to seize Yanzhou,

624
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,820
Panyi will be his first target.

625
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,980
If I offer it as my dowry,

626
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,100
he'll certainly marry me, right?

627
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,260
You're smarter than your uncle
and your father.

628
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Too bad, you're a girl.

629
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,340
I can't keep you.

630
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,500
Manman...

631
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,780
Did Heaven mean to bless

632
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,420
or punish the Qiao Clan

633
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,420
that it gave a talent like you to us?

634
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,060
What else should I know, Grandfather?

635
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,660
Be good

636
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,020
to him

637
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,340
and the Wei Clan,

638
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,540
alright?

639
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,540
The debt I owed 14 years ago

640
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,620
has to be repaid by you.

641
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
Here's the Seal of Panyi.

642
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,820
Keep it safe.

643
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,980
Thank you, Uncle.

644
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,580
Manman,

645
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,380
don't blame me.

646
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,540
I won't.

647
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
Manman,

648
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,780

Overcome hardness with softness.

Keep that in mind

666
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,340
and you'll live.

captivated by you,

don't forget to gain

more benefits for Yanzhou.

671
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,140
Lord,

672
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,180
the provisions, troops, and horses

673
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,260
in town have been counted

674
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
and registered.

675
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,140
What about the households?

676
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,940
The locals...

677
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,980
They refused to cooperate.

678
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,740
Why?

679
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,010
They must've been

680
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,860
misled by Li Su's nonsense.

681
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,340
Forget it.

682
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,100
It's not important.

683
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,420
That's fine.

684
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,020
They'll come around in a while.

685
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,980
Lord!

686
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,540
Lord,

687
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,860
Qiao's wedding procession is

688
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,060
about to reach the city gate.

689
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,740
(Qiao)

690
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,340
Are you seeking death?

691
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,700
Handing yourself to me on a plate?

692
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,820
My bow!

693
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,020
Lord.

694
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,260
Lord, wait!

695
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,620
Hold on.

696
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,420
The Qiao Clan means to make peace.

697
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,180
Why not go along with them

698
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,340
and marry that girl?

699
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,100
You'll gain Panyi.

700
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,380
Gain Panyi?

701
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Without striking a blow.

702
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,660
It's too good a deal.

703
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,260
Think twice, Lord.

704
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
Is her dowry

705
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,180
that generous?

706
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,580
(Xindu)

707
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,380
"The waters are too beautiful

708
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,820
thanks to the pretty duo."

709
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,700
The "pretty duo"

710
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,700
refers to Qiao's two girls.

711
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,300
(Xindu)

712
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Let them in.

713
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,740
Open the gate!

714
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,300
(Xindu)

715
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,580
Tomorrow,

716
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,780
we'll negotiate the marriage
with their envoy.

717
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,380
Why not get some rest, Lord?

718
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,460
I asked to see you

719
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,700
for that matter.

720
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,340
Xindu needs rejuvenation.

721
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,900
The priority is

722
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,540
to gather the locals

723
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,940
to rebuild defense works.

724
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,900
This isn't

725
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,380
the time for the marriage.

726
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,300
Those two things

727
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,420
aren't contradictory.

728
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,900
Think about it, Lord.

729
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,260
Picture the forces

730
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,220
on the Central Plains as a whole.

731
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,620
Doesn't it look like a deer?

732
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,980
Yanzhou

733
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,540
(Yanzhou)
is the head.

734
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,420
(Wei State)
Wei lies in the stomach.

735
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,060
(Bianzhou)
Bianzhou makes the spine.

736
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,380
And Liangya becomes the hooves.

737
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,220
(Liangya)

738
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,770
(Panyi)
Panyi

739
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,220
stands much higher

740
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,740
as the gateway of Yanzhou.

741
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,940
Doesn't it resemble that deer's heart?

742
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,020
Yanzhou will

743
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,660
offer us the heart

744
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,020
only if we become allies.

745
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,060
That's the price to pay.

746
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,220
If

747
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,420
she hands over Panyi to me,

748
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,100
I won't kill her.

749
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,140
That's the best I can do.

750
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,260
Your name precedes you, Mr. Gongsun.

751
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,500
I admire you.

752
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,940
We've finally met.

753
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,700
You really are one of a kind.

754
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm flattered.

755
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,500
I'm not as talented as you, Mr. Zhang.

756
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,420
Yanzhou is

757
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,980
indeed a land of talent and bliss.

758
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,060
Panyi of all is

759
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,140
well-known for its waters.

760
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,060
I had a chance to visit it years back.

761
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,980
It's been so long.

762
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,340
I wonder

763
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,020
how it looks now.

764
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,860
You know,

765
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,270
it happens to be part of the dowry

766
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,660
our lord prepared for Miss Xiaoqiao.

767
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,260
After the wedding,

768
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,260
you may come along to visit it again.

769
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,940
That'd be great.

770
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,380
If that's the case,

771
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,900
why not

772
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,140
hold the wedding there?

773
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,460
Well,

774
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,100
Xindu is majestic for its mountains.

775
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,540
Having the wedding here

776
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,660
matches the Lord of Wei's charisma.

777
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,860
Xindu isn't as rich as Panyi.

778
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,620
It was struck by war not long ago.

779
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,780
Everything needs to be rebuilt.

780
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,300
Panyi isn't as well-guarded as Xindu.

781
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,700
This marriage is of great significance.

782
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,220
It can't take any risks.

783
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,660
The climate in Panyi is better.

784
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,100
The temperature in Xindu is better.

785
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,940
Panyi is Miss Xiaoqiao's hometown.

786
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,700
Xindu is the Lord of Wei's territory!

787
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,300
Miss,

788
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,580
why are they arguing over the venue?

789
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,180
Wei requests

790
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,860
that we hand over the Seal of Panyi
before the wedding.

791
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,820
Our request is vice versa.

792
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,060
What if they change their mind

793
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,300
after getting the seal?

794
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,580
That's why we cannot compromise on that.

795
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,500
Go.

796
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,780
Xindu was shadowed by death.

797
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,740
14 years ago,

798
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,020
tens of thousands of people died here.

799
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,860
Say no more.

800
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,860
If Yanzhou

801
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,580
doesn't act in good faith,

802
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,220
you may go back

803
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,740
