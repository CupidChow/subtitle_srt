The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Greetings, Grandmother.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All rise.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you, Grandmother.

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is the embroidery shoes that the Queen Mother sewed for Great Madam.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is the embroidery shoes that the Queen Mother sewed for Great Madam.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is the new clothes of Great Madam.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please accept it, Your Majesty.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you, Grandmother.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Grandmother, you are busy with work.

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was not allowed to visit you in the past few days.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But today, I brought my new wife to visit you.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In the future, if there is any mess in the house,

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
you can teach me to be a good teacher.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I know you are busy.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can skip all the formalities.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You go ahead.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will talk to the teacher.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I heard that you are the dowry of the plate.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You also help the people to cultivate the Ninhuang Qu.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now that I am married to the King of the South,

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Qiao Wei is a family.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I will do my best to help the King of the South cultivate the Qu.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Ninhuang Qu has been cut off for 14 years.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know how long it will last this time.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
As long as I am with the King of the South,

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can save everything.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I heard that your grandfather, Qiao Gong, is good at hanging.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What do you think of this matter?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Grandfather is good at hanging.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He fights for the people and for the peace.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But sometimes he obeys the will of the gods.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He will violate his own will.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Before grandfather died,

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he was too self-abased and couldn't control himself.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
this is the result of his guilt.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Stop talking.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Since you are married to my family,

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
don't mention the past.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't have any rules here.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You don't have to greet me every day.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you are filial,

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
help me copy the scriptures.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have a message to say goodbye.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am very grateful to you.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I am very grateful to you.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You are now alone and have no one to rely on.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you have any shortcomings, please let me know.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will think of ways to help you.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
One more thing.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Before I said goodbye to Pan Yi,

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I asked you to help me.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know how things are going.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you have any problems, please help me.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's about the fate of Yan State.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You must do your best.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please take good care of me.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't miss me.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What did you say?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Man Man said

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
she wished us to live well.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Live happily in Boya.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Live a good life.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's late.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Go to sleep.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's cold outside.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Cold?

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll just make a fire later.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing outside?

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why are you out here?

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come in.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why aren't you sleeping?

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you doing out here?

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I saw it raining.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wait for me here.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't get wet.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let me help you.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, no.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't get wet.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let me.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You...

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I told you to sleep in the room.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you out here?

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's raining so hard outside.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's raining so hard.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm afraid you'll get cold.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Didn't the neighbors say

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we're a couple?

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a big history.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's the history of the world.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We'll be living in it.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We'll be living in it.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We'll live in it.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We'll live in it.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We'll be living in it.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We'll be living in it.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We'll be living in it.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Mr. Wang,

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
can we make a zither with this?

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What kind of zither do you want?

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This tall.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then,

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
it's this big.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You want a Konghou?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, yes, yes, Konghou.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Konghou.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Good, Liao.

120
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
A question?

121
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
I'll visit Your Ladyship's dried fish pond in a few days.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,520
Why didn't you wander around?

123
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,560
Success, success.

124
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,920
Ã©ra...

125
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,960
engers!

126
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

127
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,920
Xiaoman is leaving.

128
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,320
It's good that you know your mistake.

129
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,760
You're so forgiving

130
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,800
and don't make it hard for me.

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
But this morning,

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,720
I waited for you to come to ask for your safety.

133
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
But I couldn't wait.

134
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
You haven't eaten anything

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,640
since then.

136
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
Can you cook

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,920
a bowl of soup for me?

138
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,440
What?

139
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,960
You don't want to?

140
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't dare.

141
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,680
It's my duty

142
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,960
to do this.

143
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
But I'm not feeling well today.

144
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,240
My grandmother

145
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,920
asked me to copy a book

146
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
called The Invincible.

147
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,040
Even if I work day and night,

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,200
I may not finish it.

149
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
Are you trying to take my grandmother

150
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,440
to pressure me?

151
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,360
I don't dare.

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
I just think

153
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
my grandmother's wish

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
should be my grandmother's wish.

155
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
So I don't dare to be arrogant.

156
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,880
Besides, copying books is a good way to do it.

157
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,920
It's a place for marriage.

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,400
I'm afraid it's not a good time to go in and out.

159
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
How about this?

160
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,080
After I finish copying the book,

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
I'll serve you.

162
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,720
If you don't have anything to do,

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,080
I'll leave you alone.

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
You said she didn't dare.

165
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,800
I think she's very bold.

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,280
Go.

167
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,720
Ask Zhong Lin to come over for dinner.

168
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,360
I want to ask her myself.

169
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,640
Is she looking for a good wife

170
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
or my mother?

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,880
Yes.

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Hurry up.

173
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,800
Go.

174
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,400
What's going on?

175
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Stop.

176
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Brother Wang.

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,200
You're a soldier.

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,640
You think you can escape

179
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,680
after you go to Bo Ya?

180
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Come with me.

181
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,560
My lord, wake up.

182
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm over 60 years old.

183
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
I can't fight in the army.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,400
I'll fight you.

185
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
Why are you so slow?

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
You're stealing.

187
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,120
Take him down.

188
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,560
Yes.

189
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,440
Hurry up.

190
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
Wait for me.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
I'll be back.

192
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,400
Wait for me.

193
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,920
My lord.

194
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,400
My lord.

195
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Congratulations.

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
Get up.

197
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,720
Get up.

198
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,400
Congratulations.

199
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Thank you, my lord.

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,600
Everyone.

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,600
Call me Bi Zhi.

202
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
Brother Bi Zhi.

203
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Xue Tai is a good soldier.

204
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,000
He fought in the army all the time.

205
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,600
He's been defeated.

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,160
Now he even catches the old and the young.

207
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
If they come again,

208
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,040
I'll beat them away.

209
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Brother Bi Zhi.

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
You're a good man.

211
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,880
We all support you.

212
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,920
Now you should stand up

213
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
and lead the brothers to find a way to survive.

214
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,800
Yes.

215
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,280
Yes.

216
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,000
To survive.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes.

218
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,240
Yes.

219
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
But my wife and I just got married.

220
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,480
I just want to live a peaceful life with her.

221
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
You just shot the soldier.

222
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,720
Xue Tai will take the soldiers to revenge.

223
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
By then,

224
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,200
how can your wife live a peaceful life?

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,160
Yes.

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
But...

227
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,040
I only know how to raise a dog.

228
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,640
I don't know anything else.

229
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,920
I've read a few books.

230
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
I know the famous ones.

231
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
The most important thing now is to find a name

232
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,240
to convince the people.

233
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,320
So,

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,080
Bo Ya, Zhu Jun, Du Shuai.

235
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,160
What's the name?

236
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm willing to be the chief envoy

237
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
to plan for you.

238
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
We have many people.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
We have the power.

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,240
We're willing to follow the warriors.

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
We're willing to follow the warriors.

242
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,200
Bi Zhi, let's run away.

243
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
When I was in Kang County,

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
I read that

245
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,200
there were two brave generals in Bianzhou.

246
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,280
One was Li Su.

247
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,160
The other was Xue Tai.

248
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,120
He was known as the evil tiger.

249
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
He was strong and strong.

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,520
We annoyed him.

251
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,600
Bo Ya can't live anymore.

252
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Where can we escape?

253
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,960
There are many soldiers and horses outside.

254
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
I have to make myself strong.

255
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,040
I can protect you

256
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,240
only if I can take Bo Ya.

257
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,080
You've protected me very well.

258
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm very happy.

259
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,320
What are these now?

260
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,640
What I want to give you is not only this.

261
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,960
I don't want you to live a life

262
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,320
of a housekeeper.

263
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,400
As long as I'm with you,

264
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,800
I don't care about anything else.

265
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Fan.

266
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,560
I care?

267
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,760
I want to be the master of Bo Ya

268
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
for another reason.

269
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,840
Xue Tai is fighting against the army.

270
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,840
He must be holding Pan Yi back.

271
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,840
Weiguo will be worried about it.

272
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
If I can stop Xue Tai in Bo Ya,

273
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,160
it's a trip.

274
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,600
I'll fulfill your promise

275
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,920
in the mountain forest

276
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,360
and take over the army.

277
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,120
General.

278
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,160
General.

279
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
General.

280
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,440
General.

281
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
Mother asked me to come today.

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,360
Is there anything?

283
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,280
I made new shoes for you.

284
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
Your brother Bo Gong used to be like this.

285
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,840
He wore the new shoes that I made for him

286
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,680
every time he came back.

287
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Try it on.

288
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Zhong Lin,

290
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
the Qiao family and our Wei family

291
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,400
are deeply related.

292
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,520
So when the Qiao woman came in,

293
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,400
I was so angry.

294
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,640
But Chu Yu always told me

295
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,520
to treat her well.

296
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Otherwise,

297
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,520
it would be hard to be a person

298
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,080
if you were stuck in the middle.

299
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,840
All these years,

300
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,680
you've been with me.

301
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,120
I have no one to rely on.

302
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,520
Only Chu Yu can help me.

303
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,920
Do you know

304
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
why I want you to take care of Chu Yu?

305
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,400
If she's in your hospital,

306
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,120
she can stay with me.

307
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,160
Anyway,

308
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Chu Yu is our foundation.

309
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
She won't hurt you.

310
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,280
Am I right?

311
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,360
I understand what you mean.

312
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
But I need to think about it.

313
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
What are you looking at?

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
I want to read

315
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,120
the book of Wu Liang's book.

316
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Don't touch this box.

317
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,320
I won't touch it even if Yan Jun doesn't tell me.

318
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,160
I was just careless.

319
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,560
Here.

320
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,960
These are new shoes?

321
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
My mother made them.

322
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,680
Since you've worn new shoes,

323
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,920
why don't you try them on?

324
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
Here.

325
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,160
They look good.

326
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,920
I'll take these back.

327
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,120
I'll go back and study and improve.

328
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,280
Okay.

329
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,040
You're considerate of me.

330
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I should do that for my husband.

331
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,720
Why did my mother ask you to make soup today

332
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,280
but you rejected it

333
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,040
and used the super-sweet soup as an excuse to leave?

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,440
It's an excuse.

335
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
But I didn't mean to stop making soup.

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
What do you mean?

337
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,680
Jiang Ao asked me to make soup today.

338
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,600
But I was too lazy at home

339
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,120
and didn't go into the kitchen.

340
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,720
I didn't know where to start.

341
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,680
No one taught me.

342
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,160
I'm afraid no one would dare to eat it.

343
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,760
You should have said it directly.

344
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,560
My mother-in-law was disgusted with me.

345
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,760
She didn't let me in for three days.

346
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,760
She even sent someone to drive me away.

347
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
If I tell her the truth now,

348
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,520
she'll think I was trying to find an excuse to push her away.

349
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
It'll be more disgusting to me.

350
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,880
You know it well.

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,120
The city is full of people.

352
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
I won't forget it.

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Since you understand your mother's feelings,

354
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll do something

355
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,800
and you'll do it.

356
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,640
Just tell me if you need anything.

357
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,920
I'll do it.

358
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,560
My mother wants me to sign the certificate.

359
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,520
So you want me to go back?

360
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
No.

361
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,480
I want you to do it.

362
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,880
What's wrong?

363
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Didn't you say

364
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,200
that you care about your mother-in-law's reputation

365
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
and won't take the sword?

366
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,400
Why don't you care about your mother-in-law now?

367
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
I was wrong.

368
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,040
We're not a normal couple.

369
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
How could she have feelings for me?

370
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,240
I refused their promise of taking the sword.

371
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,240
Maybe I was afraid they'd use it to make an article

372
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
and use me as a shield.

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,520
Ridiculous.

374
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,360
Your Majesty,

375
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,240
should we change the agreement?

376
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,960
Yes.

377
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,160
Why not?

378
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
It's not their fault.

379
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
I didn't expect it.

380
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Do you really want the certificate?

381
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
If my mother-in-law likes the certificate,

382
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,080
she should take it as a shield.

383
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,160
I don't like it,

384
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
but I can't be bullied by others.

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
Since she wants to bully me,

386
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,520
don't blame me for finding someone who can bully her.

387
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,400
Great Madam,

388
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
the Queen is here.

389
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,080
Grandma.

390
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Didn't you say

391
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,320
you wouldn't ask me about my health?

392
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,160
You don't have to ask me about my health,

393
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,880
but I'm very considerate.

394
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,640
I'm here today

395
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
to ask you something.

396
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
Go ahead.

397
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm here to ask you

398
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
about my health.

399
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm here to ask you

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,080
about my health.

401
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm here to ask you

402
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,880
that I'm going to take care of my body Goodbye.

403
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,160
You have had a back-up of nineliÅmy six months,

404
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,280
but you have forgotten that

405
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,040
your mother loves this Su Qing death?

406
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,920
Su Qing death included

407
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,600
seeing his hands

408
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,360
and feet,

409
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,640
having his own 20% of this miscarriage,

410
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,280
being he breathed an air of indigenous sycamore,

411
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,280
and being alone.

412
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
is to choose another font

413
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,520
as the document of the concubine

414
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,040
of the Southern Army.

415
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm inexperienced

416
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,760
and dare not make any decisions.

417
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
So I came to ask my grandmother

418
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,080
to save my face.

419
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
You're here to

420
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,120
make up for my grievance, right?

421
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
I dare not.

422
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,560
Just say it.

423
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,480
Before,

424
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,480
I saved your face

425
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,080
by saying the concubine of the Shu Bo.

426
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,160
Now, if you really want to marry a concubine,

427
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,360
I'm afraid you need to think of

428
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,640
a better reason

429
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,400
so that the Shu Bo and the Southern Army

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
won't have any grudges.

431
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,520
I know.

432
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't worry about this.

433
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,880
Grandma,

434
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,520
I'm grateful to you

435
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,000
and want to be filial.

436
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,680
If I marry her to Zhong Lin,

437
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
it'll be a great honor.

438
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,760
I just want to find a

439
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,360
caring person for Zhong Lin.

440
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
Who?

441
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,560
Your heart?

442
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,160
Is this for Zhong Lin to marry a concubine

443
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,960
or for you?

444
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,000
I didn't agree to it

445
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,560
when you mentioned it last time.

446
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,320
Yes.

447
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
Last time, Mrs. Zheng

448
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,920
prepared a good marriage for Mr. Zheng.

449
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
She worked hard

450
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,560
and prepared more than that.

451
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
Now,

452
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,560
it's enough for the Zheng family

453
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,240
to find a good person for Mr. Zheng.

454
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
But Zhong Lin has been a mother of Zheng

455
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
and has been in the army for years.

456
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
She has already delayed Mr. Zheng.

457
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,520
It's all my fault.

458
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,080
If it weren't for her...

459
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,600
It's settled.

460
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,320
Madam,

461
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,680
this is the gift list.

462
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,680
Please have a look.

463
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,320
Yes.

464
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
Nian Jun, you're back.

465
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,760
You actually asked me to

466
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
find your grandmother to give you the medicine.

467
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,920
I should let you know

468
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,480
what I should do.

469
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
As for what decision my grandmother made,

470
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,120
I can't decide.

471
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,240
It's good that you know.

472
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,680
You can't decide on this.

473
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,440
It's all my decision

474
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,720
and not yours.

475
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,080
Don't make any wrong decisions.

476
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,280
Yes.

477
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
I dare not interfere with the Shengnan Army.

478
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,080
What?

479
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,480
Are you still wronged?

480
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm not wronged.

481
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,000
Nian Jun's idea is mine.

482
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,760
Then let's settle it.

483
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,520
You can go back to your work.

484
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll go to the office.

485
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,480
No need.

486
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,680
Since Nian Jun is back,

487
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,280
I can't be absent-minded.

488
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Nian Jun, please sit.

489
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,360
You didn't touch anything in my room, did you?

490
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I didn't touch anything.

491
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,960
I'm in this study today

492
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,800
to copy books for my grandmother.

493
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,320
If Nian Jun doesn't trust me,

494
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,160
I'll go to the office tomorrow.

495
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
I'm just asking casually.

496
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,480
You can enter the study

497
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,640
freely in the future.

498
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,360
If Nian Jun trusts me,

499
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,040
I won't let him down.

500
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,400
Why are you here?

501
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,360
Your mother cares about Nian Jun.

502
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,200
She asked me to

503
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,480
bring him soup.

504
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,520
It's cold.

505
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,080
Don't go out and play.

506
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,720
Chu Yu knows

507
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
how much he cares about him.

508
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,520
I mean

509
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,640
you and I are in the same room

510
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,840
and we love each other.

511
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,680
You can't think from Square gew at ordinary days.

512
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,240
My deaf mother was intended

513
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
to marry me to my cousin.

514
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
If Qiao Nu hadn't done it...

515
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,280
It has nothing to do with her.

516
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,080
It's my mother-in-law's idea.

517
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,520
Cousin.

518
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,700
You're under her spell.

519
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,280
I'm not hungry.

520
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,920
Take him out.

521
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,080
Cousin.

522
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,640
Besides,

523
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,780
this nuptial dress

524
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,440
isn't asê°ive as you ì§fsas.

525
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,000
Jiang.

526
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,360
From now on, don't come here

527
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,980
without permission.

528
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,740
I see.

529
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,520
oh

530
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,220
And just did

531
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,440
Andrea

532
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,640
The one in front of you was nothing

533
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,660
This human instinct to be

534
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,020
Let's get the camp-bï¿½-horse back.

535
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,780
People are to beiin' in separate themselves from each other in order to get more Cavemen.

536
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,860
It's my turn

537
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,140
Jump

538
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,680

539
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,980
interventions

540
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,640
Hey

541
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,260
The

542
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,680

Go!

562
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
Go!

563
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Xue Tai is strong because he's on the edge of the state.

564
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
How can I defeat Xiang Kang?

565
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,100
The only way to defeat him is to ask for help from the Kang army.

566
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
The King of the Tang Dynasty

567
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
I didn't take away my horse and slave.

568
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
I abandoned my parents and my family.

569
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,100
Now I'm ashamed to ask for help.

570
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Master.

571
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Bianzhou has been being very cautious to Bo Ya.

572
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
If we send troops now,

573
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I'm afraid we'll offend Bianzhou.

574
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Besides, Bo Ya is near Pan Yi.

575
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I'm afraid the Marquis of Wei will misunderstand.

576
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Brother.

577
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Fan is the daughter of the Qiao family.

578
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
She can't just sit around and do nothing.

579
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
She's afraid of blood and love.

580
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Yes.

581
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Master is the Zhou Mu of Yan.

582
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
It's up to Master to decide.

583
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
You know that Uncle is the Zhou Mu.

584
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,100
You're in charge of everything.

585
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
What do you think?

586
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,100
You're trying to provoke Uncle to do such a heartless thing.

587
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
A Ci.

588
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Don't be rude.

589
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
A Ci.

590
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Your grandfather also betrayed his allies to protect the people of Yan.

591
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:16,100
A man who does great things can't have too many children.

592
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
You're still young.

593
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,100
There are some principles that can't be moved in a moment.

594
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
I'm sorry.

595
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,100
It's important for the state to offend Bianzhou.

596
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Bo Ya is near Pan Yi.

597
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Wei Shao has thousands of elite soldiers in Pan Yi.

598
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
If we send troops to Bo Ya now,

599
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,100
what will Wei Shao think?

600
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Master is right.

601
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
This matter is decided.

602
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Yan State can send someone to pick Fan up.

603
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,100
But there's no way to send troops.

604
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Your Majesty,

605
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Nan Jun asked you to the study.

606
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
He said he had something important to do.

607
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Why did Nan Jun come back so early today?

608
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
If I hadn't come back earlier,

609
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
I wouldn't have found you so alert.

610
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
What does Nan Jun mean?

611
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Have you touched this box?

612
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Don't touch this box again.

613
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Did you draw these knife marks?

614
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
It's not me.

615
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
I picked it up and put it down immediately.

616
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Who drew it with a knife like this?

617
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I don't know.

618
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Who else can come in except you?

619
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Who else can come in this room?

620
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Do you think there's something important in this box?

621
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,100
I came here today

622
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,100
just to plan the original plan of Wu Liang.

623
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
And I'm afraid you'll suspect that

624
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
I've reported it to you earlier.

625
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
If I want to break the lock on purpose

626
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
or to spy on the military report,

627
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,100
why did I tell you about my actions so early?

628
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
You told me in advance

629
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
to avoid your suspicion.

630
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
I didn't know there was a military report in the box.

631
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Cheng Ran,

632
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
I'm really curious about this box and the military report.

633
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
But I really didn't open it.

634
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Although we're not husband and wife,

635
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
I don't want to use this identity to...

636
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Shut up!

637
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You're still trying to cheat me?

638
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,100
I didn't.

639
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
All of your Qiao family members

640
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
are evil people with suspicious intentions.

641
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
You're lying.

642
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
This is your Yuan Yuan's father.

643
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Let me tell you.

644
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Don't think that we can get rid of

645
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,100
the hatred of Qiao Wei when we get married.

646
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
From now on,

647
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
if you dare to touch my things again,

648
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
I won't be able to resist you.

649
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Remember?

650
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Li Jun, are you okay?

651
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Li Jun, An Nan Nan was so angry that she left.

652
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
What happened?

653
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Why are your hands so cold?

654
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
It's just a small misunderstanding.

655
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
She said I touched her box.

656
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
You guys go and check it out.

657
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Who entered my study room later?

658
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Be careful, Li Jun.

659
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I'll find out for you.

660
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
They all said they didn't hear or see.

661
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
They didn't know.

662
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I think when they saw us laughing,

663
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,100
they all heard, saw and knew.

664
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,100
It's obvious that they are all on the same page.

665
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
They are always on our side.

666
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Now that things are getting worse,

667
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
we have to find a way to arrange our own people.

668
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Li Jun, this is a big and small matter.

669
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Why don't you tell the Great Madam

670
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
to let the Great Madam know about it?

671
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
I'm afraid she won't be able to do it.

672
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
I'll ask someone to decide.

673
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,100
The Great Madam is also the Great Madam of the Wei family.

674
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,100
If I ever ask her

675
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
to let me know that she is angry with me one day,

676
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,100
then I can only let people know.

677
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Everyone says I'm like water

678
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,100
and think I can be trapped by building a dam.

679
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,100
But there is one thing they don't understand.

680
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,100
A flat and without a group can only flow like water.

681
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
If it's a land of wind and waves,

682
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
it will only cause a wave.

683
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Li Jun, why don't we go back to Yanzhou?

684
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I'll go pack up now.

685
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Aren't we just losing our minds now?

686
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
Since Yu Jun came,

687
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
we haven't been able to hold a show.

688
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,100
It's so messy.

689
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
It's better to stay in Xindu River.

690
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,100
At least we can solve the problem.

691
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
The back house is like a battlefield.

692
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
It's more fierce than a battlefield.

693
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Even the killers don't use knives.

694
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Since it's a battlefield,

695
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
the first one to be captured is the one who's going to be captured.

696
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,100
It's no use to be entangled with Madam Zhu and Uncle Zheng.

697
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,100
In the end, the one who's going to be captured is still Wei Shao.

698
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,100
If there is no conclusion in this matter,

699
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I can only let him decide the future.

700
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Although I'm in a weak position,

701
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,100
I can't just listen to the heavens.

702
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,100
This Zhen Zhi was sent to Xindu to repair the dam.

703
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,100
The Yang Feng stayed to repair the dam.

704
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,100
When the two sides are out of power,

705
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,100
the Yongning District can be re-established.

706
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Is the project going well?

707
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
One time, two times.

708
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
They both participated when they were young.

709
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
So it's not difficult.

710
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,100
But this Zhen Zhi,

711
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
his temperament and personality haven't changed at all.

712
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
Even if he met a difficult situation,

713
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
he would rather write a letter to ask for help than me.

714
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
He wouldn't write a letter to ask for help from the Yang Feng.

715
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
You don't know that

716
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
when he was young, he was even more fierce.

717
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,100
He once made trouble with Lao Wei Hou and Qiao Gui.

718
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,100
Where did Qiao Gui go?

719
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Master, do you have any worries?

720
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
How about we discuss it later?

721
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
No need.

722
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
What did you say just now?

723
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Nan Jun.

724
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Nan Jun.

725
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
What are you doing here?

726
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
I'm here to prove my innocence.

727
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
You can't touch this box.

728
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I just need a moment to prove my innocence.

729
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
I said you can't touch this box.

730
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I can't touch the box or prove my innocence.

731
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Just because I'm from the Qiao family,

732
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,100
I can only be scolded by you.

733
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
I can never turn over.

734
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Then you Qiao family is right, right?

735
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
Am I wrong or the Qiao family is wrong?

736
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,100
I thought Nan Jun and I would be together after we got married.

737
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
Nan Jun would treat me sincerely.

738
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I didn't expect him to be wary of me everywhere.

739
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Just because I'm from the Qiao family,

740
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
he treats me as a permanent enemy.

741
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
But I didn't marry Nan Jun

742
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
to steal the information.

743
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
So I have to prove my innocence today.

744
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
The number on the wine bottle

745
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
is equal to 15

746
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
in both horizontal and vertical.

747
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,100
It can be made into eight different equations.

748
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
It's not difficult.

749
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
You can solve it by learning the multiplication.

750
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
If I steal the information

751
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
and take the information,

752
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Nan Jun can treat me as a spy and punish me.

753
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
But if Nan Jun is kind

754
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
and cares about our relationship,

755
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
and he can't make a decision

756
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,100
it will be a trap for the person behind.

757
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Today, as Nan Jun's wife,

758
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
I can't trust Nan Jun.

759
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I will steal the military treasure.

760
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
I will sleep with you in the same bed.

761
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Aren't you worried about me being a murderer

762
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
and being a traitor?

763
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
I came here to prove myself today

764
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
because I don't want

765
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
such a thing to happen one day.

766
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,100
I can solve the box.

767
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
But I don't have it.

768
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
The box contains Nan Jun's favorite things.

769
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Sliding on it

770
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
is like sliding on Nan Jun's heart.

771
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
But I won't slide on Nan Jun's heart

772
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
because I will unlock it.

773
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
You are being too clever.

774
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
A Heartless Heart

775
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
After Nan Jun F overalls left,

776
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
I reflected on my own problems.

777
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
I got the box.

778
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Whether or not I can unblock it

779
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
it's an instructor warning that can't make a girlfriend.

780
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
I got it wrong you can punish me first

781
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,100
and I will never do the same thing again.

782
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,580
You think he is capable?

783
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:49,020
He cané£æå

784
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,820
I go

785
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,980
It's a good thing.

786
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,380
It's a good thing.

787
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,900
But I think the female army has good water.

788
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,860
You're wrong.

789
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,220
It's especially right.

790
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,940
The female army is so strong.

791
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,580
How can it be like the water and the river?

792
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,940
You don't understand.

793
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,940
The distance is far,

794
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,180
the water is cold.

795
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,820
No wonder the master calls the female army cold.

796
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,340
You all go down.

797
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,240
You can't go down the bridge.

798
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,020
It's okay.

799
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,780
Work a little bad

800
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,620
and sleep a little.

801
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,820
I'll go and check listening to other people.

802
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,860
Kid.

803
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,020
As a child,

804
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,180
You should fight in the battlefield when you were born.

805
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,860
You should be like your brother.

806
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,780
I'm no match for your father

807
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,980
in terms of humor and wisdom.

808
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,740
Is love the end of this life?

809
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,060
Why do I feel more and more pain?

810
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,260
I didn't get your ordinary look.

811
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,540
If I get true love from you

812
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,240
Love 13 is a noble call

813
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:44,900
through the

814
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,380
too garlic

815
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm the one who ends up like this.

816
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,380
You're an adult now.

817
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,380
You're a man.

818
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,380
Listen to me.

819
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,380
You have to be independent from now on.

820
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
Son,

821
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,380
it's not a fake hope.

822
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

823
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

824
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

825
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

826
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

827
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

828
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

829
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

830
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

831
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

832
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

833
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

834
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

835
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

836
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

837
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

838
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

839
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

840
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

841
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

842
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

843
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

844
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

845
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm not afraid of anything.

846
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,400
Open the gate by Xia truly

Wait for me

851
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,200
CÃ³mo?

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,480
Why have you ìë ¤ thie price?

853

That need anything more

854
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Raise higher

855
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,120
