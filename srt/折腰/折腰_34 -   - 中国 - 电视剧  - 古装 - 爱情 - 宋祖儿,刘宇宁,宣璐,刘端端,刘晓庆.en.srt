I...

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,740
It's you?

32
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,740
My Lord.

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,660
It's been a long while.

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,130
So, he's the one you spoke of?

35
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,500
Do you know, months ago,

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,410
he attacked Yanzhou,

37
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,610
causing us tens of thousands of casualties?

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,380
I offended you before.

39
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,730
But may I now have
the chance to redeem myself?

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,500
If we join hands this time,

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,660
we could help you reclaim true authority,

42
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,940
and take back Panyi for Yanzhou.

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,100
Panyi?

44
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,260
Governor, you're a man of great talent,

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,410
wise and formidable in battle,

47
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,130
much like the late Lord Qiao.

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,100
But Prefect

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,890
has long coveted your position.

50
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,290
He has plotted carefully.

51
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,940
Now he controls the troops,

52
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,820
and has Wei Shao as his son-in-law.

53
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,450
As the Lord of Yanzhou,

54
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,690
do you truly accept being beneath him?

55
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,060
What's the point of these words?

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,100
If Wei Shao falls,

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,690
Yanzhou will be the strongest force.

58
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,570
Qiao Ping will be left without support.

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,170
If you will not submit to him,

60
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,010
why not take a chance?

61
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,850
You want to kill the Lord of Wei?

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,380
Wei State now draws strength
from regions to build the canal.

63
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,130
Soon, their strength will be unstoppable.

64
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,380
If we do not act now,

65
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,100
there may never be another chance.

66
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,100
Over the past months,

67
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,690
I've reached out to many forces,

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,010
rallied troops to resist Wei State.

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,260
Xue Tai, a valiant warrior,
has also pledged support.

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,100
We'll strike from two fronts.

71
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,340
Everything is ready,

72
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,730
except your resolve

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,100
to cast off Wei State's yoke.

74
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,890
So, you've come to persuade me?

75
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,890
I have come today,

76
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,060
only seeking a powerful alliance with you

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,290
to crush Wei State

78
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,380
and divide its lands.

79
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,250
Ping, my brother.

80
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,220
It's been a long time
since we had an evening like this,

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,660
just sitting and drinking together.

82
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,410
Let me take this chance

83
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,020
to toast you first.

84
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,460
Bottoms up.

85
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,980
I know I'm mediocre.

86
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,700
All these years,

87
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,340
it's you who held everything together.

88
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,930
I'm proud of you,

89
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,730
but also ashamed that I've done so little.

90
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,610
Here's a second cup

91
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,490
to show my respect.

92
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,540
Yue,

93
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,250
please don't put me on a pedestal.

94
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,410
If not for you,

95
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,580
who always showed such grace,

96
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,410
what could I

97
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,850
have done alone?

98
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,730
I should be the one

99
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,460
to toast you.

100
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,900
Very well.

101
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,340
As long as we stand united,

102
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,050
there's nothing we can't overcome.

103
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,620
Cheers.

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,140
I have something

105
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,980
to tell you, Ping.

106
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,730
Please go on.

107
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,140
I've decided

108
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,850
to lead Yanzhou

109
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,780
in allegiance to Liu Yan, Lord of Liangya,

110
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,490
and sever all ties
with Wei Shao of Wei State.

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,090
Why?

112
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,420
No...

113
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,620
wait.

114
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,980
Why didn't you

115
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,250
say a word of this beforehand?

116
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,340
Ping, what do you mean?

117
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,540
Must I seek your permission

118
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,730
for every decision?

119
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,930
That's not what I meant.

120
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,250
Right now,

121
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,490
the realm is in turmoil
and its future uncertain.

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,980
Yanzhou, for the moment,

123
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,050
can still hold its own.

124
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,410
In my view,

125
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,140
we should wait and observe.

126
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,410
It's unwise to turn to Liangya so hastily.

127
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,460
Yue,

128
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,700
have you ever considered

129
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,250
our Qiao Clan has an in-law relationship

130
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,660
with the Wei Clan.

131
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,540
If one is in trouble,

132
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,930
the other should come to its aid.

133
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,540
Even if not,

134
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,540
we shouldn't betray them.

135
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,050
So in the end,

136
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,250
you just want to tie Yanzhou's fate

137
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,250
and the Qiao Clan's

138
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,930
to Wei Shao?

139
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,730
Am I right?

140
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,220
Back then,

141
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,850
when our families allied by marriage,

142
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,610
Yue,

143
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,250
you supported it too.

144
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,020
But now,

145
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,340
at the first sign of trouble,

146
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,700
you're ready to turn your back!

147
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,850
How is this

148
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,610
any different

149
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,540
from being a turncoat?

150
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,490
How dare you speak to me this way.

151
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,490
Do you still see me as your elder brother?

152
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,460
Remember, I am the Lord of Yanzhou!

153
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,540
I have no sons.

154
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,700
I treat Ci as my own.

155
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,020
Why do you think I'm doing this?

156
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,780
Do you really believe it's for myself?

157
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm doing this for Yanzhou's future!

158
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,930
Know this,

159
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,580
my alliance with Liangya

160
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,340
is not open to your objections!

161
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,450
You...

162
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,220
You drugged my wine!

163
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,370
No, I didn't.

164
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,410
- I didn't.
- My eyes...

165
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,180
You traitor!

166
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
Traitor...

167
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,690
Is he dead?

168
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
He's still breathing.

169
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,370
What did you give him?

170
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,770
Why can't he see anything?

171
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,530
I don't know.

172
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,100
Liu Shan gave me the drug.

173
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,650
He said it's much stronger
than ordinary knockout drops.

174
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,060
It must be

175
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,010
his rage.

176
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,650
It triggered temporary blindness.

177
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,250
He might recover in a few days.

178
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,970
My Lord,

179
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,250
our top priority must be
to seize control of Prefect,

180
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,940
take back command of the troops,

181
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,340
and take charge of the situation.

182
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,580
How is Ci right now?

183
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,010
Wait.

184
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,850
Only restrain him. Do not harm him.

185
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,180
Rest assured, My Lord.

186
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,820
I've sent trusted men to guard him closely.

187
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,260
(Boya)

188
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,940
Look over here,

189
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,980
Li.

190
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,970
Ma'am,

191
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,610
here's a letter from Kangjun.

192
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,420
Is it from Ci?

193
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,340
(I heard you had a son.)
What does it say?

194
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,900
(I hope you and Bi Zhi return to Kangjun
to enjoy family time.)

195
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,610
It's from Father.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,580
He heard

197
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,220
I have a son

198
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,490
and wants to meet Li.

199
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,940
He hopes we bring him back
to Kangjun for a while.

200
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,580
I know grandparents have a special bond

201
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,610
with their grandkids.

202
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,940
Father must be so happy

203
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,180
to be a grandfather now.

204
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,420
He must have forgotten past arguments.

205
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,700
I hope so.

206
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,820
But Father

207
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,420
really does love children.

208
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,010
When we were young,

209
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,530
he treated us so well.

210
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,650
He's fallen asleep.

211
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,420
I'll go find some fast horses.

212
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,580
We'll set out at once.

213
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,370
No rush.

214
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,650
We're going back to Kangjun.

215
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,340
(Kangjun)

216
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,370
There they are.

217
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,820
Whoa.

218
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,580
Fan, get down.

219
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,460
- Father.
- Father.

220
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,490
We've waited so long for you.

221
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,180
Where are Mother, Uncle, and Ci?

222
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,940
They're all waiting in the mansion.

223
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,770
I heard you've been good to Fan.

224
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,460
You often pick sour plums for her?

225
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,300
Yes.

226
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
I learned the recipe

227
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,980
to pickle them from a kitchen maid.

228
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,650
She loves them.

229
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,700
What a coincidence.

230
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,100
The plums in Kangjun are ripe now.

231
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,180
They're in the West Hill.

232
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,730
Go pick some for her.

233
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,100
Let's have a taste as well.

234
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,730
- Yes.
- Father.

235
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,010
We've only just arrived.

236
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,340
Don't send Bi Zhi

237
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,980
off on errands right away.

238
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Besides,

239
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,100
back when Mother was in Boya,

240
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,010
I stopped him from picking sour plums.

241
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,890
He's a respected leader now.

242
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,340
Since he's my son-in-law,

243
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,610
he ought to show some filial piety.

244
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,580
Earlier,

245
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,220
I acted rashly driven by
anger toward Wei Shao.

246
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,700
I did something inappropriate.

247
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,530
You and I share the same blood.

248
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
I should treat Bi Zhi well.

249
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,180
The two of you should hold

250
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,770
a proper wedding ceremony.

251
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,010
Now that you have a son,

252
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,980
it's time to make it official.

253
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,460
Father, I'll be right back.

254
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,220
Good, don't be long.

255
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,980
- Bi Zhi...
- Don't worry.

256
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,060
I'll be right back.

257
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,420
Come to the mansion with me.

258
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,770
Li is still in the carriage.

259
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,890
We'll fetch him in a moment.

260
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,890
Bi Zhi! Come back!

261
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,490
Father, what are you doing?

262
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,090
- Gag her.
- Let me go!

263
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,650
What are you doing?

264
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,530
Bi Zhi!

265
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,090
Bi Zhi,

266
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,650
stop right now,

267
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,250
or she'll get hurt.

268
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,610
So, you're Bi Zhi, the green-eyed stableman.

269
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,650
Just as Xue Tai said, you're hard to handle,

270
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,580
but you love your wife deeply.

271
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,850
All the better.

272
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,130
You'll make a fine weapon

273
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,300
against Wei Shao.

274
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,580
I once swore an oath.

275
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,530
I will never harm Lord of Wei
or Her Ladyship.

276
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,850
In that case,

277
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,370
she'll get hurt.

278
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,690
Stop!

279
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,060
Kneel.

280
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,300
Kneel!

281
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,300
From this day forth,

282
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,010
be you a stableman

283
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,370
or my slave,

284
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,610
stay by my side,

285
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,820
and obey my command.

286
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,940
If not...

287
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,660
Well then,

288
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,890
you can try and see

289
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,820
whether you're faster

290
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,100
than my blade.

291
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,140
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

292
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,250
- Whoa.
- Stop.

293
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,460
State your name and purpose.

294
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,490
I'm Wei Liang from Wei State,

295
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,500
here on Lord of Wei's orders

296
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,700
to invite Prefect of Kangjun.

297
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,490
General Wei, please wait a moment.

298
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,130
General, Wei Liang has arrived.

299
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,970
Shall we let him in?

300
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,770
General Wei,

301
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,640
you may enter.

302
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
Giddy-up.

303
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,860
(Kangjun Wharf)

304
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,930
Shopkeeper,

305
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
do you have any fine orchids from Yanzhou?

306
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,100
The fine ones are back at my home.

307
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,010
They're costly, though.

308
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,980
Still want them?

309
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,060
Price is no issue.

310
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,010
Give me the best.

311
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,490
Sure. Follow me.

312
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,130
Move aside!

313
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,980
Out of the way!

314
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,940
Move it!

315
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,500
Shopkeeper,

316
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,330
has Kangjun been peaceful lately?

317
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,180
Thanks to Prefect,

318
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,140
every home sleeps with their doors wide open.

319
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,860
But why are there

320
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,490
so many patrols on the street?

321
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,460
I don't know why.

322
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,090
There are more patrols lately. That's true.

323
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,050
Let's go.

324
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,980
Governor.

325
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,330
General, your arrival is sudden.

326
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,530
May I ask what brings you here?

327
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,620
Her Ladyship misses her father,

328
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,250
so His Lordship sent me here
to invite Prefect Qiao

329
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,770
to stay in Yujun for a while

330
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,490
until Her Ladyship gives birth.

331
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,010
They can enjoy some family time.

332
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,090
To invite Prefect?

333
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,530
Manman is about to give birth.

334
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,380
He is a man, after all.

335
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,250
He can't help much there.

336
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,050
He'd only cause trouble for the Lord of Wei.

337
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,920
How about this?

338
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,490
Once Manman gives birth safely,

339
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,570
I'll visit them with Ci.

340
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,290
Governor, you're overthinking.

341
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,810
It's no trouble at all.

342
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,050
How about we ask Prefect

343
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,660
and hear his thoughts?

344
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,250
My brother hasn't been well lately.

345
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,980
He's resting at home now,

346
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,420
not seeing guests.

347
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,330
Prefect is sick?

348
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,730
Then I should visit him

349
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,460
to show His Lordship's filial piety.

350
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,290
I'll go right now...

351
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,090
He just took some herbal soup and is asleep.

352
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
I'll send someone to check if he's awake.

353
00:18:59,050 --> 00:18:59,900
Mr. Zhang,

354
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,900
go and take a look.

355
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,930
Yes.

356
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,050
This kind of small thing

357
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,620
should be left to servants.

358
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,090
Why trouble Advisor

359
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,330
with such things?

360
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,380
Zhang Pu is more thoughtful.

361
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,460
Where's Young Master Ci?

362
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,730
I haven't seen him in a while.

363
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,860
I truly miss him.

364
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,380
Ci went hunting in the hills.

365
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,570
It's getting late,

366
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,860
and he's not back yet?

367
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,730
He's still a kid

368
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,700
and really playful.

369
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,090
By the way,

370
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,010
I heard in Boya

371
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,490
that General Bi Zhi and Ma'am

372
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,050
were invited here in Kangjun too.

373
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,330
Did they bring their child?

374
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,810
May I visit them?

375
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,860
General, must you ask about

376
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,420
every single member of my family?

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,090
General,

378
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,730
was Ma'am's delivery smooth?

379
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,060
General,

380
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,090
you...

381
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,570
Governor,

382
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,940
you want to side with Liu Yan?

383
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,770
Since Wei Shao's lackey is here,

384
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,460
there's no way you'll make it back alive.

385
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,890
Bi Zhi,

386
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,250
you green-eyed scum!

387
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,570
You'd betray Lord of Wei too?

388
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,060
Bi Zhi,

389
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,570
what are you waiting for?

390
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,570
Don't you care about your wife and son?

391
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,540
Go get him!

392
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,900
Hurry! Go get him!

393
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,130
My Lady.

394
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,770
I've prepared some food for Ci.

395
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,220
By His Lordship's order,

396
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,330
no one is allowed inside.

397
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,170
Insolence!

398
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,940
How dare you speak to me like this?

399
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,860
Am I not the Lady of Yanzhou?

400
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,660
I need to

401
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,010
check the food box, My Lady.

402
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,770
Do you need to search me as well?

403
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,810
I wouldn't dare.

404
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,850
Let her in.

405
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,300
- Aunt.
- Ci.

406
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,490
- Ci.
- Aunt.

407
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,250
What happened out there?

408
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,330
How is my father?

409
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,290
Why did Uncle lock me up?

410
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,050
Don't call him Uncle anymore.

411
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,250
He's allied himself with Liu Yan

412
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,730
and is plotting against the Lord of Wei.

413
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,090
Your father and Cousin are locked away too.

414
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,380
Even Bi Zhi is being forced

415
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,730
to serve them now.

416
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,770
General Wei Liang came unexpectedly,

417
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,770
and they attacked him.

418
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,250
We don't even know if he's still alive.

419
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,860
Ci, your top priority now

420
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
is to get out of here,

421
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,180
rescue General Wei Liang,

422
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,530
and inform Lord of Wei.

423
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,850
My Lady!

424
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,570
Step aside!

425
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,460
Young Master Ci, calm down.

426
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,380
Step back!

427
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,290
- Step back!
- Make...

428
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,290
Make way!

429
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,900
Ci! Ci!

430
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,700
Get out of the way, you all!

431
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,220
If anything happens to Ci,

432
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,860
how will you explain to Governor?

433
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,140
Move!

434
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,820
Ci?

435
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,020
Move aside!

436
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
Ci?

437
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,940
Young Master Ci, please stay calm.

438
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,380
Don't follow me.

439
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,620
Aunt,

440
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,300
take care.

441
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,140
- Go get him!
- Ci!

442
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,620
Ci! Ci!

443
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,530
Are you alright, My Lady?

444
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,730
Ci...

445
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,570
My Lady.

446
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,980
Stop right there!

447
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
Go after him!

448
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,500
Don't run!

449
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,570
Stop!

450
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,110
Stop!

451
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,330
- Don't run.
- Don't run.

452
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
Go get him!

453
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,660
Bring the orchids to Wei and tell them,

454
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Boya has rebelled!

455
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,050
Kangjun has rebelled!

456
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,890
General!

457
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
Tell Xiaotao

458
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,010
not to wait for me!

459
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,620
Xiaotao,

460
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,250
don't wait for me.

461
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,220
My Lord, be careful.

462
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
Where is Ci?

463
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,810
He escaped.

464
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,220
I've sent men after him.

465
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,250
He escaped?

466
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,290
Whatever happens, don't take his life.

467
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,180
My Lord.

468
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,380
In this case,

469
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,900
our secret plans

470
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,530
will likely be exposed.

471
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,180
Then we don't hide it.

472
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,330
Let's start the war.

473
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,290
Attack Panyi

474
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,730
and catch them off guard.

475
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,330
If we control the Yongning Canal,

476
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,900
we control the lifeline of every region.

477
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,940
Seriously?

478
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,570
Panyi is heavily guarded.

479
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,900
It's not so easy to take.

480
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,980
Exactly.

481
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,980
That's up to you, Governor.

482
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,050
Can you find a way

483
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,050
to knock the gates of Panyi open?

484
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,540
Well...

485
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,530
Yang Feng, Mayor of Panyi,

486
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,290
once served my father closely.

487
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,940
He's a slippery one, though.

488
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,570
Let's hope he doesn't stop us.

489
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,860
(Panyi City, Wei State)

490
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,860
(Panyi)

491
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,140
(Wei)

492
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,010
Open the gates!

493
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,660
Open the gates now!

494
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,980
Open the gates.

495
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,860
Open the gates now!

496
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,420
What's going on, General?

497
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,220
Lord Yang, look.

498
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,050
Why would they suddenly show up like this?

499
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,530
Both Governor of Yanzhou

500
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,570
and Commander of Boya Forces

501
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,730
come here together.

502
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,460
General, let me ask them.

503
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,490
Governor,

504
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,860
why have you

505
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,250
brought troops here?

506
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,140
Yang Feng,

507
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,090
Liu Yan attacked Kangjun.

508
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,290
Luckily, Bi Zhi saved us.

509
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,140
Open the gates quickly. I seek refuge.

510
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,900
Please wait a moment, Governor.

511
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,080
General,

512
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,620
Wei State and Yanzhou are bound

513
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
by both marriage

514
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,770
and alliance.

515
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,900
Please allow the family of the late Lord Qiao

516
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,140
to take shelter in the city,

517
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,010
and send a message to Yujun

518
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,980
without delay.

519
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,620
Well...

520
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,010
Thank you very much, General.

521
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,130
Alright.

522
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,510
Open the gates!

523
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,810
Open the gates now!

524
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,570
Governor,

525
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,810
please enter quickly.

526
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,330
General... General Bi Zhi,

527
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,050
what are you doing?

528
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,330
Yang Feng,

529
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,570
I've allied with Liangya

530
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,700
to resist Wei State.

531
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,460
From this day on,

532
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,460
Panyi returns to Yanzhou's rule.

533
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,810
You once served my father closely

534
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,220
and are a man of wit.

535
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,700
I trust you know

536
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
what must be done,

537
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,060
don't you?

538
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,650
Yes, I do.

539
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,740
Governor,

540
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,490
your march here with so many troops.

541
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,180
Has Xindu noticed?

542
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,140
Xindu?

543
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,330
In this realm,

544
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,700
who could possibly rival Bi Zhi?

545
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,780
True.

546
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,180
And what about Zhen Zhi?

547
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,980
Bi Zhi.

548
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,810
He lacked your subtlety

549
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,940
and tried to stop us.

550
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,620
He fell in the line of duty.

551
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,530
Governor.

552
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,700
My Lord.

553
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,660
Mayor Yang, please

554
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,380
inform all regions.

555
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,900
The watergate at Yongning Canal

556
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,330
is now under my control.

557
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,620
All forces and nobles must reconsider

558
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,810
where their loyalties lie.

559
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,890
Yes,

560
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,740
I understand.

561
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,300
(Panyi, Wei)

562
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,460
(Qiao)

563
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,290
You fell in the line of duty?

564
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,700
If I had known sooner,

565
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,010
I would've had a drink with you

566
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
back in Rongjun.

567
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,700
Liu Yan's evil heart never dies.

568
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,250
If such a warmonger gains control of

569
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,620
(Governor of Yenzhou)
the water source,

570
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,220
how can the realm ever find peace?

571
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,050
Want me to join him?

572
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,210
Never!

573
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,050
I told them to follow the Lord of Liangya,

574
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,380
(Governor of Taozhou)
but they wouldn't listen.

575
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,380
Luckily, we chose our side early.

576
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,460
We might yet claim

577
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,770
a share of the spoils.

578
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,770
Wei State is too strong.

579
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,140
(Governor of Yaozhou)
I agreed to help build the canal

580
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,940
only as a temporary move.

581
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,530
If Liangya State

582
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,330
really defeats Wei State,

583
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,980
that will be a good thing.

584
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,090
Let's wait and see.

585
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,260
(Proclamation: Liangya now
accepts Panyi's surrender.)

586
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,900
My Lord, your asthma is acting up again.

587
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,250
Shall I call for the physician?

588
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,530
Liu Yan...

589
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,700
He is dead set on mutual destruction.

590
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,180
We cannot let Shiyuan

591
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,490
get dragged into this mess.

592
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,610
Yes.

593
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,820
Young Master.

594
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,260
Shiyuan, you're back.

595
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,300
Son, you've been
guarding the border for a while.

596
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,900
You've done well.

597
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,530
It's time you came home.

598
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,610
You've been away too long.

599
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,530
I do miss you.

600
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,260
Governor, I'd like to request command

601
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,740
of a military unit.

602
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,740
Is there any unrest at the border?

603
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,260
Are you hurt, son?

604
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,100
No, it's fine.

605
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,740
So,

606
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,090
you want to reinforce Yujun?

607
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,010
Liu Yan caught us off guard.

608
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,740
I just need to help out for a few days

609
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,900
to ease Zhonglin's troubles.

610
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,820
Shiyuan!

611
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,530
Given the current situation,

612
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,690
I've held back from attacking Wei State

613
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,530
out of respect for your ties with the Weis!

614
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
As for the rest,

615
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,380
don't bring it up again.

616
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,700
Governor!

617
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,700
- Guards.
- Yes, My Lord.

618
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,690
Escort Young Master to his chambers.

619
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,530
You must be tired from the journey.

620
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,380
Rest in your chambers for the next few days.

621
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,860
Young master,

622
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,140
this way, please.

623
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,180
(Zhongzhou Post House, Zhongzhou)

624
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,420
My Lady, General Xue Tai has arrived.

625
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,620
My Lady,

626
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,490
the Lord of Liangya has announced

627
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,050
he has taken Panyi.

628
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,380
Our plan has succeeded.

629
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,780
Very well.

630
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,610
In that case,

631
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,820
I need Governor of Zhongzhou to meet me.

632
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,010
Zhongzhou is

633
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,210
a thousand li from Panyi.

634
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,530
Even if they gather troops,

635
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,070
their aid would be slow.

636
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,690
Who said I plan to attack Panyi?

637
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,490
What's your plan, My Lady?

638
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,780
Since Liu Yan took Panyi

639
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,860
and the Yongning Canal,

640
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,420
Wei Shao surely won't sit still.

641
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,820
The moment he moves,

642
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,010
I'll strike straight for Yujun

643
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,980
and wipe out the Wei Clan.

644
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,340
I didn't expect that to be your plan.

645
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,460
The Lord of Liangya attacks Panyi

646
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,170
to rule the realm,

647
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,380
but what I seek

648
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,610
is so much more than that.

649
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,980
I will walk over the bones of the Wei Clan,

650
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
wade through their blood,

651
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,010
and rise to the top, step by step.

652
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,090
The humiliation the Weis inflicted on me,

653
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,130
I shall return it in full.

654
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,300
Who's there?

655
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,380
(Yujun, Wei State)

656
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,300
Who are you?

657
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,610
My brother-in-law...

658
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,380
Young Master Ci!

659
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,460
Inform His Lordship!

660
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,220
Ci.

661
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,610
- You're awake.
- Manman.

662
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,380
My Lord.

663
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,900
I sent Wei Liang

664
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,340
to invite you and Father.

665
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,690
Why are you the only one back?

666
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,340
Xiaotao.

667
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,860
General Wei Liang

668
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,170
asked me to give the orchids to you.

669
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,210
General Wei Liang...

670
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
He died fighting.

671
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,420
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,380
Did you hurt your head or something?

673
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,420
He's a stand-up man.

674
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,170
You say he's dead and that's it?

675
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,740
We waited all night for you to wake up.

676
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,210
What do you do?

677
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,780
The first thing you say is
that Wei Liang's dead?

678
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,940
Can you think before you speak?

679
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,420
He has that huge shield.

680
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,940
How could he die just like that?

681
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,980
You're still alive,

682
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,820
but why isn't he?

683
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,570
Believe whatever you want.

684
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,900
I'm going to do the laundry.

685
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,260
Ci,

686
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,970
what exactly

687
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,780
do you mean by that?

688
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,890
Just say it.

689
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,050
Say it!

690
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,530
General Wei Liang

691
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
died fighting.

692
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,300
Uncle was incited by Zhang Pu

693
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,210
to ally with Liu Yan

694
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,940
and rebel against His Lordship.

695
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,900
Zhang Pu even drugged Father.

696
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,420
Now, Father is blind.

697
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,420
Uncle imprisoned me, Cousin,

698
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,980
and my nephew, and forced Bi Zhi

699
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,650
to turn against us.

700
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,490
I don't know why

701
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,170
General Wei Liang came to Kangjun

702
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,570
to see me and Father.

703
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,080
Out of fear that the truth
would come out,

704
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,610
Liu Yan ordered a siege.

705
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,380
We couldn't hold them off.

706
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
General Wei Liang fought to
get me out of there,

707
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
but he...

708
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,740
He...

709
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,460
It should've been me.

710
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,300
It should've been me.

711
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,210
Qiao Ci,

712
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,580
look at me.

713
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,780
Wei Liang went to fetch you, right?

714
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,450
Where is he now?

715
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,050
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

716
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,260
He went to Yujun.

717
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,420
Answer me. Where is he now?

718
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,050
Look at me. Where is Wei Liang?

719
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,740
Where is Wei Liang?

720
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,780
Where is he?

721
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,130
It should've been you.

722
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,530
Why did it have to be him?

723
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,460
Why not a Qiao?

724
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,300
Wei Xiao!

725
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,380
My Lord!

726
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,330
Reporting!

727
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,820
Liu Yan has taken Panyi with his troops.

728
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,210
Pass down my orders:

729
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,530
All troops, stay on alert.

730
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,420
Tomorrow,

731
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,420
we march on Panyi!
