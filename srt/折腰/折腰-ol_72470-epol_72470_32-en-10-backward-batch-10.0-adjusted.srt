00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,820
Do you blame me?

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,260
Why would you say that?

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,410
When you were at home,

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
you were treasured like a jewel.

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,380
But in the Wei State,

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,020
you're cautious everywhere.

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,260
The Wei State

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,410
is not a cage,

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,930
but for you,

39
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,930
it's no different.

40
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,410
And I've never seen you

41
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,820
so at ease before.

42
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,380
It's my fault.

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,690
You treat me well.

44
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,540
The days with you

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,260
are comfortable and happy.

46
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,130
Then it's settled.

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,060
Kangjun is your home,

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,730
and Yujun

49
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,730
is also your home.

50
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,900
Let's go.

51
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,820
This used to be my favorite place.

52
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,980
In summer, the trees grow thick and full.

53
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,010
I would dance

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,570
as Cousin played the zither.

55
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,500
Those days

56
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,380
seem far away now.

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,260
Maybe,

58
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
some still linger.

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
You're really lucky today.

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,060
Cousin feels like playing again.

61
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,010
Her zither is of exquisite craftsmanship.

62
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,730
How about this?

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,500
I'll play a piece for you.

64
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,010
No need today.

65
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,060
I've heard you play before.

66
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,610
Spend some time

67
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,130
with your cousin today.

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,260
I'll go for a stroll.

69
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,180
Manman!

70
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,340
Don't get up.

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,020
You're with child now.

72
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,250
How could you come
all the way out here alone?

73
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,540
Do you still see yourself as a young miss?

74
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,460
Soon, you'll be a mother.

75
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,900
We've been apart for so long.

76
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,460
Meeting here in Kangjun is a rare chance,

77
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,250
so I came early to wait for you.

78
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,100
Cousin, if ever you miss me,

79
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,490
just come back anytime you want.

80
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,700
When I left,

81
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,660
I didn't bring this zither with me.

82
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,410
But now,

83
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,050
my fingers itch to play.

84
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,090
It's perfect.

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,250
I would be delighted to hear you play.

86
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,810

Manman and I

118
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,660
feel distant now.

119
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,050
It'll be alright.

120
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,580
Why do you

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,900
look so downcast?

122
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,020
I just feel

123
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,540
Cousin and I are no longer as we once were.

124
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,980
That day in Xindu,

125
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,700
when Yanzhou was under siege,

126
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,460
I went to her for help.

127
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,530
She told me...

128
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,130
You know it's dangerous up ahead.

129
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,100
Are you going to send him to die?

130
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,580
You are capable and responsible.

131
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,700
You can save the people of the realm,

132
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,010
but I'm different.

133
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm just an ordinary woman

134
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,770
with no ambition and no grand vision.

135
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,580
Even if I give it my all,

136
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,850
I can only protect one person.

137
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,700
I'm not like you,

138
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,300
who pushes her husband

139
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,250
fight and die

140
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,300
for the Qiao Clan,

141
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,610
and for the people of Yanzhou!

142
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,850
But I...

143
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,370
I can't do it.

144
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,530
Did I make a mistake?

145
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,340
Even Cousin knew

146
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,460
not to let her husband take such risks.

147
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,370
But I pushed you, pressured you,

148
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,210
even calculated you.

149
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,420
In those days, I was so afraid

150
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,850
you would think the same,

151
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,980
that I cared nothing for your safety.

152
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,820
In that situation,

153
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,460
you had no other choice.

154
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,530
Besides, I know

155
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,130
my Manman

156
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,340
is not like other women.

157
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,780
She loves me,

158
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,250
her family,

159
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,580
and all the people even more.

160
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,650
So you did nothing wrong.

161
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,140
Also,

162
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,420
I'd love to be your spear and shield,

163
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,060
to fight for you,

164
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,300
to guard your path,

165
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,530
to make your every wish

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,340
come true.

167
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,850
I have one more wish.

168
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,730
What is it?

169
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,490
"May you be safe and sound."

170
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,370
You just said

171
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,180
all my wishes would come true.

172
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,820
All I wish is for you to be safe and sound.

173
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Don't worry.

174
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,850
I will be.

175
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,730
You startled me.

176
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,370
Over there.

177
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,820
Feel free to have a look.

178
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,690
Thank you.

179
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,450
It's beautiful.

180
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,850
Isn't it?

181
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,730
Does it good?

182
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,570
It does.

183
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,660
It really does.

184
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,340
See? It looks just like you.

185
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,220
This one?

186
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,060
Like me?

187
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,610
This chubby little thing is you exactly.

188
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,100
What's wrong?

189
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,700
I'll keep my distance.

190
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,580
I'm chubby. I don't want to crowd you.

191
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,100
It's cheerful and bright.

192
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,490
Everyone,

193
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,940
you've fled far

194
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,130
and suffered much.

195
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,100
For now,

196
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,420
please settle here,

197
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,700
stay warm and well-fed.

198
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,610
Prefect, that's so kind of you!

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,610
Prefect, that's so kind of you.

200
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,650
I never thought

201
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
- he'd gave us shelter.
- Exactly.

202
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,300
Prefect, you're so kind.

203
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,650
He doesn't look down on us Liangya people.

204
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,520
Exactly.

205
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,460
In the days ahead,

206
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,460
we'll do what we can for you, Prefect.

207
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,180
Thank you, Prefect.

208
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,130
No need for formality.

209
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,250
Please rise.

210
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,250
Distribute the food.

211
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,770
Mother,

212
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,650
this is for you.

213
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,610
You eat that.

214
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,450
Prefect,

215
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,730
our food was already scarce after the war.

216
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,850
Now I fear we won't hold out much longer.

217
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Pass my order.

218
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,340
Stop all wine brewing.

219
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,940
We should

220
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,100
save the grain first.

221
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,660
Yes.

222
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,500
(Grain)

223
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,490
Lord of Wei.

224
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,220
May I ask why you are here?

225
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,820
And what's this for?

226
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,940
These are military supplies

227
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,180
I brought to Kangjun.

228
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,220
I hope they will be helpful.

229
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,650
Also, grain from Xindu

230
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,770
will arrive in a few days.

231
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,650
Lord of Wei,

232
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,060
you've lifted a great burden from us!

233
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,180
On behalf of the people,

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,940
I thank you, Lord of Wei.

235
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,940
Please rise.

236
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
No need for formality.

237
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,610
Although you thank me,

238
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,530
there's something

239
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,530
I want to ask you.

240
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Because of Liangya,

241
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,340
Yanzhou lies in ruins now.

242
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,010
Why do you shelter

243
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,100
these stragglers and refugees?

244
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,130
Moreover,

245
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,300
some of them may have fought

246
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,060
against you in Liancheng.

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,490
These common folks

248
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,250
are war-torn innocents.

249
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,770
They are pitiful souls with nowhere to go.

250
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,370
Does it really matter where they come from?

251
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,420
Who among them

252
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,420
ever wished for war?

253
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,530
They had no choice.

254
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,220
Lord of Wei,

255
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,730
you built canals for the realm

256
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,250
and gave up troops.

257
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,940
You never asked who helped

258
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,890
or opposed you,

259
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,460
nor cared about

260
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,420
past kindness or grudges.

261
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,010
You did it for the people, and so do I.

262
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,770
That's true.

263
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,460
If peace ever comes

264
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,890
one day,

265
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,940
I'll guard it with all my heart

266
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,010
and ensure it

267
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,370
lasts for generations.

268
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,130
Even if peace lasts only for a moment,

269
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,580
a sincere heart can make

270
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,770
its echo last for generations.

271
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
If every region

272
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,610
followed your example, Lord of Wei,

273
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,580
then true sincerity

274
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,130
could dissolve hatred

275
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,530
and

276
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,220
bring peace to the land.

277
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,490
I'm willing to assist you

278
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,060
in completing the canal construction.

279
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,700
Let's face difficulties together.

280
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,010
Let water flow in all directions.

281
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,370
Let war be quelled.

282
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,420
Let sincerity dispel hatred

283
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,850
and win peace for the realm.

284
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,300
I hope that day will come.

285
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,300
At the end of the day,

286
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,980
since they've come to Yanzhou,

287
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,650
I can't simply

288
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,940
watch them starve.

289
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,420
But, I'm sorry

290
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,820
for causing you trouble.

291
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,010
You shouldn't have burdened

292
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Wei State because of this.

293
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,420
You're welcome.

294
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,300
In chaotic times,

295
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,530
the people are the most innocent.

296
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,130
Father, we share the same intention,

297
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,770
so I wish to help.

298
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,370
What did you call me?

299
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,730
I called you Father.

300
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,460
It's been a while
since I married Her Ladyship,

301
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,770
but the journey's been rough.

302
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,340
Only now do I get to speak with you.

303
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,010
Your heart is with the people,

304
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,340
just like Her Ladyship's.

305
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,220
Father, I hope

306
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,940
you don't mind

307
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,860
my being late.

308
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,490
Lord of Wei,

309
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,250
I don't deserve this.

310
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,180
This gesture

311
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,810
is not from the Lord of Wei

312
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,330
to the Yanzhou Prefect.

313
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,530
It's from a son-in-law

314
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,730
to his father-in-law.

315
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,660
Zhonglin, you show such respect.

316
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,140
I feel

317
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,530
all the more

318
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,220
uneasy and ashamed.

319
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,900
We're family, no need to be so formal.

320
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,860
The night banquet is about to begin.

321
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,700
Let's go together,

322
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,660
Father.

323
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,650
Of course.

324
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,650
Of course.

325
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,260
This way, please.

326
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,570
(Zhonglin bears no grudge.)

327
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,250
(But our Qiao Clan)

328
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,490
(still owes the Wei Clan a great debt.)

329
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
Father,

330
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,490
I'd like to offer you a toast

331
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,490
on behalf of Her Ladyship.

332
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,050
Thank you for raising her.

333
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,180
Speaking of raising her...

334
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,540
Right,

335
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,660
Yue and Lady Ding

336
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,770
have treated Manman as their own,

337
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,490
especially Lady Ding.

338
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,700
She deserves

339
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,290
this toast from Zhonglin.

340
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,090
Mother,

341
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,490
I'd like to offer you a toast.

342
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,570
Thank you

343
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,730
for raising Fan.

344
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,980
Lord of...

345
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,300
Zhonglin,

346
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,250
here's to the rebuilding of Yongning Canal.

347
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,020
Everyone,

348
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,490
raise your cups.

349
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,740
To the canal.

350
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,980
Although

351
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,660
Governor is Manman's uncle,

352
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,530
Yanzhou and Wei State

353
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,140
lie between us.

354
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,860
You'd better

355
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,490
call me Lord of Wei.

356
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,770
Lord of Wei...

357
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,570
Zhonglin means to speak

358
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,900
to me as family,

359
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,700
and to you as an official.

360
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,740
It doesn't conflict.

361
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Um, well,

362
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,260
Bi Zhi.

363
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,780
Governor.

364
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,420
You should call me Father.

365
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,380
Father.

366
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,660
I've heard

367
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,530
you repeatedly defeated Xue Tai.

368
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,220
You're pretty talented.

369
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,010
We're short on generals in Yanzhou.

370
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,490
Seems you're destined
to join the Qiao family.

371
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,860
Governor, you flatter me.

372
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,090
Call me Father.

373
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,980
Father.

374
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,570
Though I've fought Xue Tai a few times,

375
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,860
I'm just a stableman.

376
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,730
I know little beyond that.

377
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,180
I merely scraped by.

378
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,810
Fan once said

379
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,940
Xue Tai feared

380
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,700
Lord of Wei and Her Ladyship,

381
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,490
so he never attacked me head-on.

382
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,140
To Lord of Wei.

383
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,220
Cheers.

384
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Now that

385
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,460
you and Fan have both returned home,

386
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,140
settle in properly.

387
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,290
I'll send someone to take over Boya.

388
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
Thank you, Father.

389
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,330
Do you truly

390
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,940
accept Fan and me now?

391
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,810
Boya is just a small place.

392
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,660
Bi Zhi can still manage it well.

393
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:20,900
Besides,

394
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,180
I've grown used to it.

395
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,700
We will return someday.

396
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,090
That's our real home.

397
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,980
Manman asked for your help, but you refused.

398
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,860
No wonder Wei Shao keeps his distance
from me.

399
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,730
Father, don't worry.

400
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,420
Lord of Wei holds no grudge.

401
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,290
He's still willing to be Bi Zhi's in-law.

402
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
You're too naive.

403
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,420
He's only being polite

404
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,420
because Bi Zhi is useful.

405
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,140
I've explained

406
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,420
the pros and cons to Manman.

407
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,050
I didn't want Bi Zhi

408
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,380
risking his life to help them.

409
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Manman understands.

410
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,330
Daughters often grow distant after marriage.

411
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,330
Daughters of others

412
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,330
know to stand with their kin.

413
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,810
Mine ran off with a stable hand.

414
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,290
At the crucial moment,

415
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,250
you turn your back on your family for him!

416
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,300
Father,

417
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,860
Bi Zhi is no longer

418
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,330
a stableman.

419
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,300
I know.

420
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,140
He's now Commander of Boya Forces.

421
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,090
The so-called forces

422
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,900
are just a ragtag army.

423
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,090
And you think it's a fine title?

424
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,250
Go tell Bi Zhi,

425
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,090
I'll take over Boya.

426
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,460
He will train my cavalry

427
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,770
and raise my steeds.

428
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,220
He should back up Ci,

429
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,700
so no one dares trample on me.

430
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,490
I refuse.

431
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,180
What did you say?

432
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,010
Father, since you still

433
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,460
see Bi Zhi as a stableman,

434
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,420
I suppose

435
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,180
you'll never accept him as your son-in-law.

436
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,700
I'll live in seclusion with Bi Zhi at Boya.

437
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,530
Let's not interfere with each other.

438
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,900
Wouldn't that be better?

439
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
You...

440
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,140
Do you even hear yourself?

441
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,010
To you, I'm just a daughter

442
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,570
who ran off with a stableman.

443
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,250
When Bi Zhi and I were in real danger,

444
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,570
you didn't send a single soldier to help us.

445
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,220
But now that Bi Zhi's gaining power,

446
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,460
you want to use me to control him?

447
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,050
I won't let that happen.

448
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Also,

449
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,050
Bi Zhi didn't come

450
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,620
to fight against Liu Yan.

451
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,010
That decision was mine alone.

452
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,900
The Qiaos never lent him aid.

453
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,420
I could not let him
risk his life for my family.

454
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,900
Manman never blamed me for this.

455
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,330
Governor, you have even less right to!

456
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,380
I am

457
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,530
unfilial to Mother,

458
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,810
and I may have wronged my cousins.

459
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
But, Father,

460
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,010
I owe you nothing.

461
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,090
- You...
- Governor!

462
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,490
If you wish to claim Boya as your own,

463
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,660
send your troops and take it by force.

464
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,610
My Lord.

465
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,660
Mr. Zhang,

466
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,620
look at me now.

467
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,090
Do I look like a patriarch to you?

468
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,180
Both ladies are now backed
by powerful husbands.

469
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,570
They're no longer easy to control.

470
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,380
But I believe

471
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,420
both of them still hold loyalty

472
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,940
toward Yanzhou.

473
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,180
Loyalty to Yanzhou,

474
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,700
but not to me!

475
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,170
Tell me,

476
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,460
what caused all of this?

477
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,770
My Lord,

478
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,010
refugees have been flooding

479
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,700
into Kangjun lately.

480
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Prefect's reputation

481
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,860
may now outshine your own.

482
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,330
What's wrong?

483
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,610
Fan,

484
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,290
you'd defy

485
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,730
your father for me.

486
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,570
That saddens me,

487
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,900
but also makes me happy.

488
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,940
You fool,

489
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,460
I'm not defying him.

490
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,050
Father has always

491
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,530
bullied the weak and feared the strong.

492
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,770
I won't blindly follow him

493
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,220
just because he raised me.

494
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,410
Remember this.

495
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,090
In this realm,

496
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,810
no one can

497
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,770
use me to control you.

498
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,330
Fan,

499
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,570
I'm not scared.

500
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,330
Everything I've done

501
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,900
was for your happiness.

502
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,180
Being with you makes me happiest.

503
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,180
I only hate myself

504
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,570
for not giving you the honor

505
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,050
that the Lord of Wei can.

506
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,330
If I cared about that,

507
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,530
I wouldn't have left with you.

508
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,290
What I care about

509
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,810
is your honest heart.

510
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,380
Sour plums.

511
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,570
That's exactly what I wanted.

512
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,900
It's cold outside.

513
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,900
Let's go into the room.

514
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,940
I love this room.

515
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,770
It's filled with your scent.

516
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,180
It just smells like your wine now.

517
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,980
Does it?

518
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,980
Can you still smell it?

519
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,220
You cheeky rogue.

520
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,860
We're returning to Wei State tomorrow.

521
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,090
Is there anything else

522
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,980
you'd still like to do?

523
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,500
Tell me.

524
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,490
I'll go with you

525
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,940
at first light.

526
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,460
I have nothing else.

527
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,770
I never imagined a day like this

528
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,010
before I married you.

529
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,140
You weren't just pretending to be happy

530
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,660
for my sake, were you?

531
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,420
If I said I was,

532
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,050
you wouldn't believe me.

533
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,250
Then

534
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,290
if you want to make it up to me,

535
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,420
how about

536
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,420
we strike a deal?

537
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,700
Whatever you want, say it now.

538
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,530
If it's something I can do,

539
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,810
I'll give it my all.

540
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,610
How about

541
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,730
giving me a child?

542
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,570
You want a child from me?

543
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,460
What do you mean, from you?

544
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,660
It would be our child.

545
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,570
And

546
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,730
I want it now.

547
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,570
I promise I'll give you a new home,

548
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,980
one filled with children and joy.

549
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,900
(Kangjun)

550
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,180
There's not much time.

551
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,050
You still need to hurry back to Yujun.

552
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,380
I won't insist on keeping you.

553
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,770
I only hope that next time,

554
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,810
you'll stay a little longer.

555
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,290
Governor, you're so kind.

556
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,780
Father,

557
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,250
we'll take our leave.

558
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,770
Please take care of

559
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,180
your health.

560
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,420
May I have

561
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,700
a word with you?

562
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,370
Of course.

563
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,220
Is this the direction to Wei State?

564
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,850
That's right.

565
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,780
- Father...
- Father.

566
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,460
On behalf of the Qiao Clan,

567
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,530
I bow from afar

568
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,170
to the spirits of

569
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,460
the late Lord of Wei,

570
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,490
your late father and brother.

571
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,820
I don't dare to seek forgiveness,

572
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,490
only to express my deepest gratitude.

573
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm grateful to Lady Xu

574
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,570
and Lord of Wei

575
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,370
for your magnanimity.

576
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,130
Back then,

577
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,340
at the battle of Xindu,

578
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,570
it was the Qiao Clan's fault.

579
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,260
We brought disaster upon your kin.

580
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,170
I feel deep remorse.

581
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,570
My guilt is beyond words.

582
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,130
The grudge between our families

583
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,380
was settled long ago

584
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,940
by my grandmother.

585
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,420
You bear no resentment,

586
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,050
but I cannot pretend to forget.

587
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,980
All I ever wanted

588
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,940
was for Manman

589
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,380
to marry

590
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,610
someone she loved,

591
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,170
a man who would cherish her,

592
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,780
and live a peaceful life with her.

593
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,260
But fate had other plans.

594
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,780
On my late father's deathbed,

595
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,980
he took advantage of the situation

596
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,940
and arranged this marriage with you.

597
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,130
If the Qiaos and the Weis

598
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,010
had traded places,

599
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,380
I must admit

600
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,460
I wouldn't have treated

601
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,610
an enemy's daughter kindly.

602
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,650
But Lady Xu

603
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,900
has been gracious and generous.

604
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,490
She has cared deeply for my daughter.

605
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,650
You didn't turn her away.

606
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,210
You've shown her great care.

607
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,090
Even for her single request,

608
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,610
you dropped everything

609
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,380
to personally escort her home

610
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,570
and stepped into Yanzhou.

611
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,210
That made me all the more ashamed.

612
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,260
Now I see,

613
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,420
all my doubts

614
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,900
came from judging you

615
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,260
by my own narrow heart.

616
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,260
Father,

617
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,820
I'm ashamed as well.

618
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,530
I, too,

619
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,460
once made things difficult

620
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,490
and treated Her Ladyship harshly.

621
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,210
When did you ever treat me harshly?

622
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,650
I'm just a man of little worth.

623
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,260
Life and death, honor and shame,

624
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,820
they're fleeting to me.

625
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,380
All I care about

626
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,610
is my daughter.

627
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,460
Today,

628
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,610
I'd like to take this chance

629
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,010
to entrust Manman you, Lord of Wei.

630
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,380
Please protect her

631
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,420
and let her live a life of joy.

632
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,340
Here and now,

633
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,460
I offer you my sincere gratitude.

634
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,740
Father,

635
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,740
you have my word.

636
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,090
From now on,

637
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,570
I will cherish Manman even more.

638
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,300
Please,

639
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,420
trust me.

640
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,220
I trust you.

641
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:20,970
I really do.

(Yujun, Wei State)

643
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,380
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

644
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,220
My Lady,

645
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,980
these are the ceremonial items prepared for

646
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,300
tomorrow's memorial rite.

647
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
Please take a look.

648
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,860
(Gift List of the Memorial Rite)

649
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,130
His Lordship won a great battle

650
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,300
and honors his father and brother.

651
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,340
You've worked so hard for this,

652
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,980
but will you be allowed to attend

653
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,210
and step into the ancestral hall?

654
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,420
Forget it.

655
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,340
Back when we first arrived in Yujun,

656
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,170
we were left outside of the city gates

657
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,650
just to avoid taking part in this very rite.

658
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,570
According to tradition,

659
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,690
a new wife who hasn't paid her respects
at her husband's ancestral hall

660
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,130
is not accepted nor recognized by the family.

661
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,130
Whether they accept me or not

662
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,420
depends on His Lordship's attitude.

663
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,300
Besides,

664
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,980
to ask Grandmother, Mother, and His Lordship

665
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,530
to let me into the ancestral hall

666
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,690
is asking too much, isn't it?

667
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,420
Why do I bring trouble upon myself?

668
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,660
My Lady,

669
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,820
this was rushed by His Lordship's orders.

670
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,490
He reminded them again and again,

671
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,610
worried it might delay
tomorrow's memorial rite.

672
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,190
My Lady,

673
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,780
this is the ceremonial robe.
