Grandmother?

00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,240
Grandmother?

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Shiyuan.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,730
Grandmother.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,360
Are you feeling better now?

37
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,770
When was I ever unwell?

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,330
Lady Qiao said you were…

39
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,010
I understand now.

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,010
I'm glad that you're fine.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,800
I'll take my leave.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,120
Shiyuan.

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,400
Are you never going

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,770
to see me again?

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I've been unfilial

46
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,560
and caused you worry.

47
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,210
Please scold me

48
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,330
and punish me.

49
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,400
I hold no complaints at all.

50
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,170
This is not your fault.

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,610
Stand up.

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,800
No, it is my fault.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,450
It's my fault losing my mind.

54
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,170
I nearly did something...

55
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,520
that would bring shame to the Wei family.

56
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,890
How did you learn
the truth about your birth?

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
While I was traveling,

58
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,730
a man approached me.

59
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,050
He claimed to have served Chen Pang.

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,290
He told me everything.

61
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,290
Shiyuan,

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,800
though you know your origins,

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,960
you may not know the whole story.

64
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,470
Your mother, Qingyun,

65
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,820
was my only daughter.

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,930
I cherished her

67
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,890
like a pearl in my palm.

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,680
But she was abducted by Chen Pang

69
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,730
and violated.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,090
Three years later, she returned,

71
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,850
bearing you in her womb.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,490
She died after

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,610
giving birth to you.

74
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,680
What did you say?

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,090
She was abducted? Violated?

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,900
When you were a child,

77
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,850
I kept this hidden from you.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
Later,

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
when you were about 14 or 15,

80
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,410
we clashed with Bianzhou
in the battle of Xindu.

81
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,930
At that time,

82
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,320
you swore to defeat Bianzhou.

83
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,360
Had I told you the truth,

84
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,440
what would you have done?

85
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,150
I've always urged Zhonglin

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
to let go of the Qiao family grudge.

87
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,730
But deep down,

88
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
I could never let go

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,630
of my hatred for Chen Pang.

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,850
I shouldn't have misled you

91
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,200
into thinking you were from the Wei State.

92
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,970
Everything that happened

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,880
was my fault.

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,970
Grandmother,

95
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,000
did you truly see me as your grandson?

96
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,760
All these years,

97
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,850
you've always treated me like Zhonglin,

98
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,490
and at times,

99
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,930
showed me

100
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,320
even more affection.

101
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
But whenever

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,090
it came to military command,

103
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,610
you always left me out. Why?

104
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,730
Because you carry

105
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,740
the blood of

106
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,370
the Chen family.

107
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,490
Shiyuan,

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,410
since your grandfather passed away,

109
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,290
I've carried the Wei family on my shoulders.

110
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,970
I could never

111
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,560
fully trust you.

112
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,760
And Chen Pang wants the two

113
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,560
of you to reunite as father
and son in Bianzhou.

114
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,560
If Bianzhou changes hands,

115
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,530
you'll become the heir.

116
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,800
Now that it's out in the open,

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,530
you need to make a choice.

118
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,650
If you wish to stay by my side,

119
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,090
you will

120
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,200
still be my grandson.

121
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,060
I'll care for you as I always have.

122
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,850
But

123
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,380
I will never entrust you with power.

124
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,060
If you choose Bianzhou,

125
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,300
I won't stop you.

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,780
Before you leave,

127
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,900
kneel and bow to me three times,

128
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,660
as thanks

129
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,780
for my raising you all these years.

130
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,740
Then you leave this mansion,

131
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,660
and never come back.

132
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,180
A lost soul

133
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
is like a stray hound.

134
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Grandmother,

135
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,180
I bow three times

136
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,060
to thank you for raising me.

137
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,180
I know you've always worried for me,

138
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,540
which is why you hesitated

139
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,780
to tell me the truth

140
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,940
about who I really am.

141
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
From this day on,

142
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,540
I belong only to the Wei family,

143
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,660
because I can't bear to leave you.

144
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,180
My Lord, now you're reassured?

145
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
Yes, My Lady.

146
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,980
You're so wise.

147
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,660
Since you praised me,

148
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,300
I shall do all I can to help.

149
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,300
Let me do one more thing for you.

150
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,980
What is it?

151
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
Ma'am.

152
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,420
What are you doing here?

153
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,620
You...

154
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,700
Are you here to enjoy the show?

155
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,660
It's cold at night.

156
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,060
The ancestral hall is colder.

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
I made some soup for you, Mother.

158
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,900
Take it away.

159
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,940
Drop the act. You're no saint.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,660
If it weren't for you,

161
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,300
would Mother even punish me like this?

162
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,660
I've never wanted to harm you,

163
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,420
but you're using
the wheat seed matter to hold it

164
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
over me, aren't you?

165
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,420
Even though

166
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,900
you're now part of the Wei family,

167
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,420
I still don't like you.

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,060
Mother has never

169
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,580
liked me. That's fine.

170
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Now, even you are
making things harder for me.

171
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,500
I've been in this family for 20 years.

172
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,540
Maybe no great deeds, but I gave it my all.

173
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,060
And now, my place in this house

174
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,900
even worse more than an enemy's.

175
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,820
I never expected you to like me.

176
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,020
All I want is for His Lordship
to have peace of mind.

177
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,580
And I believe that's what you want too.

178
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,300
This time, because of the wheat seeds,

179
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,060
he's been torn between me and Mr. Wei.

180
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,700
I don't want him

181
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,900
caught between his mother

182
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,780
and his wife.

183
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,180
What happened with the seeds

184
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,140
was my fault.

185
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Zhonglin hasn't

186
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,540
come to see me since.

187
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,700
He must still resent me.

188
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,940
Indeed, he's angry about it.

189
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,660
But it wasn't you

190
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,660
who steamed the seeds.

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,020
You confessed

192
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,660
out of care about His Lordship.

193
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,700
It shows you've changed.

194
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,300
You truly care for him now.

195
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
He cares for you, too.

196
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,580
He's not good with words,

197
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,020
so he asked me

198
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
to visit you.

199
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,420
Really?

200
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,700
Is that truly what Zhonglin thinks?

201
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
Even if he doesn't blame me,

202
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,900
Mother

203
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,420
will surely do.

204
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,940
This punishment

205
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,420
is harsher than usual.

206
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,660
I don't know how long
it'll take to finish copying.

207
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,540
Mother, please don't worry.

208
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,660
This time,

209
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,780
it's different.

210
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,780
The punishment is for outsiders to see.

211
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,420
Once you're done kneeling,

212
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,540
you and Grandmother

213
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,900
will truly be family.

214
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,260
(Danjun, Bianzhou)

215
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,620
Xiang.

216
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,660
Xiang!

217
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,900
Xiang...

218
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,780
Xiang.

219
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,180
You've held on long in illness.

220
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,420
That's not easy.

221
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,140
Now,

222
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
you may rest.

223
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,620
My Lord,

224
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,420
Bianzhou can't go a day without a leader.

225
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,540
Please take up the role of Governor.

226
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,020
From now on,

227
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,140
Uncle will watch over Bianzhou for you.

228
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,380
I heard

229
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,940
you've been with my father
since you were young.

230
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,140
So, you must have

231
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,180
known my mother as well.

232
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,020
Yes.

233
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,420
Let me ask you something.

234
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,060
How did

235
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,300
my mother

236
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,180
and father first meet?

237
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Say it.

238
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,780
His Lordship and Her Ladyship...

239
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,780
They were deeply in love.

240
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,940
Deeply in love?

241
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,780
Young Master.

242
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,300
You're still lying.

243
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,540
My mother was abducted
and violated by Chen Pang.

244
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,060
She died because of him.

245
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,260
Isn't that the truth?

246
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,660
Do you think

247
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,900
you'd still be alive if I move

248
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,020
this dagger just a little closer?

249
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,940
Go back and tell him,

250
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,540
I'll burn everything

251
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,020
he ever gave me.

252
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
And

253
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,060
he's not my father. He is my enemy.

254
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,300
If I see him on the battlefield,

255
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,500
I'll take his life.

256
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,900
Chen Lie sent word.

257
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
The heir refused

258
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,780
to return to Bianzhou.

259
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,540
That's fine.

260
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,700
Let him have some fun in Wei for now.

261
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,300
I rule Bianzhou now.

262
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,900
The power is in my hands.

263
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,060
Sooner or later, he'll come back.

264
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,820
My Lord, you're far-sighted.

265
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,580
The heir will understand one day.

266
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,580
What about Lady Su?

267
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,700
She should be arriving in Danjun soon.

268
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,220
What's wrong?

269
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,540
She escaped?

270
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,340
Her nephew

271
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,380
is troublesome.

272
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,060
But our guards are searching thoroughly.

273
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,980
Please rest assured.

274
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,820
The peony huadian on her forehead

275
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,980
makes her easy to spot.

276
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,060
She won't get far.

277
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,140
She's too well known

278
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,860
to fall into the wrong hands.

279
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,220
It'll only make her bolder.

280
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,500
Pass down my command.

281
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,860
My nephew's dying wish

282
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,060
was for Lady Su to remain chaste.

283
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Find her at all costs.

284
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,060
Confine her in the Yulou Pavilion

285
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,140
as a tribute to their bond
as husband and wife.

286
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,620
Yes.

287
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,380
Thank you for visiting, Sir.

288
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,620
We are from the same clan.

289
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,940
No need to say that.

290
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,780
Lady Qiao.

291
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,780
Mr. Wei.

292
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,220
This courtyard is usually so quiet.

293
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,300
But ever since

294
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,820
Grandmother fell ill,

295
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,020
people keep coming to visit.

296
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,580
Lady Xu had always been in good health.

297
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,780
This illness was brought on by the Qiaos.

298
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,060
Are you Qiaos here

299
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,860
just to curse the Wei family?

300
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,780
She had nothing to do with the wheat seeds.

301
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,980
Sir,

302
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,260
please don't twist the truth.

303
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
She's innocent.

304
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,540
She's innocent?

305
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,060
Since when the Qiaos are innocent?

306
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,220
You know what?

307
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,060
Fourteen years ago...

308
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,300
Let the past rest.

309
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,220
True,

310
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,260
the Qiaos betrayed us 14 years ago,

311
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,860
but it had nothing to do with her.

312
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,420
Besides,

313
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,620
she is now a daughter-in-law of this family,

314
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,740
the Lady of Wei.

315
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,900
Sir,

316
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,300
would you turn against your own?

317
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,540
You are all being fooled by the Qiaos.

318
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,340
Thank you for standing up for me.

319
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,860
You're welcome.

320
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,340
Would I ever side with some bitter old man

321
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,860
to bully a defenseless lady?

322
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
My Lord,

323
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,460
these wheat seeds from Yanzhou

324
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,860
arrived so quickly.

325
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,060
We should thank Her Ladyship.

326
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,780
But she always looks out for the Qiaos.

327
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,060
Now that the wheat seeds are here,

328
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,940
it's time to begin digging

329
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,300
the canal to Rongjun.

330
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,140
Do you have a plan, My Lord?

331
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,100
- Wei Xiao.
- Yes.

332
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,020
Go to Panyi,

333
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
pick up Yang Feng,

334
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,020
and escort him to Rongjun.

335
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,140
Yes.

336
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,820
But he is

337
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,260
a former officer of Qiao Gui,

338
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,700
known for two-faced loyalty.

339
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,460
We can't let him run

340
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,220
the whole canal construction.

341
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,540
We must stay cautious.

342
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,900
Yes.

343
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,820
Fourteen years ago,

344
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,540
Panyi and Xindu built

345
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,020
the Yongning Canal together.

346
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,780
Now, we have

347
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,540
Yang Feng working with us.

348
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,500
If we could add one of our own,

349
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,780
wouldn't that be better?

350
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,940
Wei Xiao, when you

351
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,140
pass through Xindu,

352
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,700
deliver a letter to Zhen Zhi.

353
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,540
Tell him to take office in Rongjun.

354
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,380
Yes.

355
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,500
But I'm still worried about it.

356
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,300
Rongjun is far from Yujun,

357
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,740
and it borders Bianzhou.

358
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,260
It's always been difficult to govern.

359
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,860
The current prefect, Yuan Wang,

360
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,220
has strong local support

361
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,100
and close ties to Wei Dian.

362
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,060
They're discussing marriage alliance.

363
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,460
In my view,

364
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,060
we need someone with more influence.

365
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,940
I'll go myself.

366
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,460
Delivering wheat seeds is the pretext.

367
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,100
It'll demonstrate your authority,

368
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,780
secure the canal construction,

369
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,140
and put pressure on Wei Dian and Yuan Wang.

370
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,740
That would be perfect.

371
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,060
Besides, this can't be delayed.

372
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,740
I'll depart in two days.

373
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,580
(Bianzhou Border, Bianzhou)

374
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,340
Ehuang,

375
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,820
soon after we went to Wei,

376
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,540
the Lord grew weaker by the day.

377
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,540
Soon...

378
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Soon after,

379
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,340
he...

380
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,380
He what?

381
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,460
He passed away.

382
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,300
My empress's fate...

383
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,410
He was too weak to bear it.

384
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,780
He couldn't even wait...

385
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,980
He didn't live to see

386
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,860
his foster child.

387
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,580
Who's in charge now?

388
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,980
Chen Pang.

389
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
He still got his way.

390
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,100
Things have changed in Bianzhou.

391
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,300
Chen Pang

392
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
has ordered a citywide search for you.

393
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,700
They're looking for a woman with a huadian.

394
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,620
He's declared that you'll be imprisoned

395
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,260
for life in the Yulou Pavilion.

396
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,580
Shameless!

397
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,340
My husband isn't even cold yet,

398
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,860
and he dares to

399
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,380
covet my empress's fate.

400
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
But this wasn't

401
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,700
Chen Pang's idea.

402
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,100
It was the Lord's last wish.

403
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,940
What?

404
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,740
He feared that

405
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,540
your empress's fate might

406
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,980
bring danger to Bianzhou.

407
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,500
So, before he died,

408
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,860
he instructed Chen Pang

409
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,860
to confine you in the Yulou Pavilion

410
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
until your final days.

411
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,100
I know his decision

412
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,540
truly broke your heart.

413
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,020
But please, take care of yourself.

414
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,700
We both married for politics.

415
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Lady Qiao found true love,

416
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,140
while I ended up in a cage
built by Chen Xiang.

417
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,940
Don't let this weigh on you, Ehuang.

418
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,860
There's no true love greater

419
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,020
than political interest.

420
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,540
If I had

421
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,820
a family like Lady Qiao's,

422
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,580
I wouldn't be in this position.

423
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,980
Ehuang,

424
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,340
now isn't the time to dwell on this.

425
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,500
Let's figure out how to get out of here.

426
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,100
Who would've thought that

427
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,260
my empress's fate became a curse?

428
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,460
This board

429
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,700
is set.

430
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,020
I won't surrender.

431
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,300
We can't count on anyone in Danjun.

432
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,620
Take me

433
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,780
out of the city, alone.

434
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,700
Then we'll make a plan.

435
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,060
Ehuang,

436
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,060
Chen Pang's men are everywhere.

437
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,820
How am I supposed to get you out?

438
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,300
Find a woman with a huadian on her forehead!

439
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

440
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,830
- Stop right there.
- Stop!

441
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,660
Officer, what's wrong?

442
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,140
Don't arrest me.

443
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,500
Keep searching.

444
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,340
Yes.

445
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,380
Ehuang,

446
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,140
those are Chen Pang's men.

447
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,340
Ehuang?

448
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,860
Aren't they looking for
a woman with a huadian?

449
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,100
Now,

450
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,700
I don't have it anymore.

451
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,300
The canal reaches Rongjun.

452
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,940
Planting winter wheat there

453
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
could make Rongjun

454
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,580
the largest grain supplier for Wei.

455
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,460
So, this journey is crucial.

456
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,380
I must go there myself.

457
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,580
Rongjun has always been
aligned with Wei Dian,

458
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,380
yet he continues to provoke us

459
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,940
and challenge your authority.

460
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,780
Use this opportunity

461
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,020
to put him in his place.

462
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,140
Yes.

463
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,580
That's what I'm thinking too.

464
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,980
Then you'd best set out soon.

465
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,340
Alright.

466
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,050
Zhonglin,

467
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
stay and chat with Grandmother a bit longer.

468
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,140
I'll go tell them to prepare the meal.

469
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,220
Yan, wait.

470
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,020
There's something

471
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,380
I want to ask of you.

472
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,620
You don't have to be so formal with me.

473
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,980
But you know what I'm like.

474
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,100
Fun, I can handle. Business? Not so much.

475
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,020
I'll be away in Rongjun for a while,

476
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,820
but someone has to keep an eye on Yujun.

477
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,380
You're here,

478
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,940
so help me watch over it.

479
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,940
I'm hungry.

480
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,780
Since Zhonglin entrusted you,

481
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,010
just give him a hand.

482
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,780
You'll be by my side anyway.

483
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,300
There's nothing to worry about.

484
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,060
Yan,

485
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,020
may I ask for your help?

486
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,460
I'll do my best.

487
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,540
I won't let you down.

488
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,780
Go have the meal prepared.

489
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
We'll dine at my place tonight.

490
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,780
Yes.

491
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,220
Zhonglin,

492
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,060
this time, Shiyuan and I

493
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,820
were able to make peace

494
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,780
all thanks to Lady Qiao,

495
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,140
who stepped in to mediate.

496
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
You knew that, didn't you?

497
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,140
Yes, I did.

498
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,340
Lady Qiao

499
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,220
is a thoughtful, well-mannered young woman.

500
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
You flatter her, Grandmother.

501
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
Zhonglin.

502
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,220
Some things

503
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,100
are better left in the past.

504
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,860
I hope that on this journey to Rongjun,

505
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,700
you will finally be able to

506
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,830
let go of what's behind you.

507
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,580
You know what?

508
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,500
I've sent Wei Xiao

509
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,340
to Panyi.

510
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,140
He's bringing Yang Feng to Rongjun.

511
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,100
Since you trust him,

512
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,140
I'll write him a letter

513
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,620
to remind him not to be careless.

514
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,140
No need.

515
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,380
Stay seated.

516
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,340
I need to make this clear.

517
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,220
Even though I know Yang Feng

518
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,780
cares about Yanzhou,

519
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,140
I'm still choosing to use him.

520
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,300
It's entirely my decision,

521
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,100
so there's no need to

522
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,340
thank the advisor.

523
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,860
I know.

524
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,060
You trust me,

525
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,500
so I should write to him

526
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,860
to make sure he doesn't let you down.

527
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,460
You don't have to do that.

528
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,300
I will go there myself.

529
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,580
Let's eat.

530
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,220
My Lord, you've spent years

531
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,860
traveling far and wide.

532
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,100
You must've seen all kinds of scenery.

533
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,780
Sadly, I'm not.

534
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,260
I came to Yujun from Kangjun when I married.

535
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,380
That's the only journey I've ever taken.

536
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,060
So I wanted to go out and see the world,

537
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,500
just like you.

538
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,860
See the place where you grew up.

539
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,700
Yujun is

540
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,060
where I grew up.

541
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,300
I heard Rongjun is mountainous,

542
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,780
so different from the waterways of Yanzhou.

543
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,300
I've always wanted to see it for myself.

544
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,220
Do you want

545
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,340
to come with me?

546
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,860
I can take care of your meals
and daily needs.

547
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,700
You don't need to worry about that.

548
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,300
Tan can handle everything.

549
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,170
This isn't the kind of trip
I can bring you on.

550
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,060
It's all work.

551
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,100
But winter wheat

552
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,740
requires special planting methods.

553
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,300
Seeds alone won't grow

554
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,220
if you don't plant them right.

555
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,740
What do you mean?

556
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,300
I could teach the farm officers,

557
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,140
and they could pass it on to the people.

558
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,060
But I'm afraid

559
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,380
some things might

560
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
get lost in between.

561
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,100
If the harvest fails next year,

562
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,740
it could cause serious trouble.

563
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,220
Or, do you just

564
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,780
not trust me,

565
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,540
My Lord?

566
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
It's not about trust.

567
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,540
It's just that

568
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,980
this journey will be dangerous.

569
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,860
I don't mind.

570
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,300
You will protect me, won't you?

571
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,180
Alright then.

572
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,460
Well,

573
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,500
go get packed.

574
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,980
We leave the day after tomorrow.

575
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,540
Okay.

576
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,060
There's nothing special about planting wheat.

577
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Yeah.

578
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,140
There's really nothing special here.

579
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Could it be

580
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,500
that Her Ladyship just wants to

581
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,060
keep you company?

582
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,460
No way. Absolutely not.

583
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,300
Her Ladyship

584
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,340
is smart and always puts the people first.

585
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,020
She takes her duties seriously.

586
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,860
Maybe

587
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,780
she really does have

588
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,540
a unique method she can't share openly.

589
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Or maybe

590
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,780
she just really cares and wants

591
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,100
to see it through.

592
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,620
That must be it.

593
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,140
Fine.

594
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,780
I'll take her with me

595
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,620
on this trip.

596
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,300
Fine.

597
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,140
(Hope to meet again in Rongjun.
Wishing you well.)

598
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,100
My Lady, you really
do care about His Lordship.

599
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,460
But My Lady,

600
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,700
why do we have to go

601
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,940
with His Lordship?

602
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,780
Silly girl.

603
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,380
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

604
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,940
My Lord,

605
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,060
the troops have been counted,

606
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,020
and the grain carts are on their way.

607
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,540
When are we heading out?

608
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,580
Give it a moment.

609
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
Yes, My Lord.

610
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,060
Told her not to come, but she insisted.

611
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,140
Such a hassle.

612
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,140
This one's ugly. Give me another one.

613
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
But it looks good.

614
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,990
Where's the green one?

615
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,860
Here it is.

616
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,780
His Lordship said
it looked good on me last time.

617
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,020
And that jingling hairpin.

618
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,140
- This one?
- Yes, that one.

619
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Who said it looked good?

620
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,980
Wearing a

621
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,620
jingling hairpin in the carriage

622
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,700
would be so annoying.

623
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,340
My Lord, I'll go hurry her.

624
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,700
Give it a moment.

625
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,380
It's natural for a young lady

626
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,060
to dress up.

627
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,060
No need to rush.

628
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,620
My Lord,

629
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,140
I have a little idea

630
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,580
about this journey.

631
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,620
How about we

632
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,060
take a detour this time?

633
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,540
My Lord?

634
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,580
Take a detour?

635
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,420
We'll talk about it later.

636
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,860
Yes.

637
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,940
My Lady.

638
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

639
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,500
Let's go.

640
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,220
The way His Lordship looks at you today

641
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,860
is different.

642
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,300
Yan.

643
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,460
Grandmother's worried you might feel

644
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,320
lonely on the trip,

645
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,820
so she asked me to see you off.

646
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,700
After all, I've got nothing better to do.

647
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,980
I'm just a lonely man.

648
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,700
Then marry early

649
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,860
if you're lonely.

650
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,260
Spare me, please.

651
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,500
It's a long trip ahead.

652
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,660
Mr. Gongsun,

653
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,060
Yan, please

654
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,540
keep an eye on Yujun.

655
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,980
Just leave it to us.

656
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,540
You focus on taking care of your wife.

657
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,900
Lady Qiao,

658
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
with your beauty, even if

659
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,220
you were thin and worn out,

660
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,660
you'd still shine.

661
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,180
Remember to eat more, okay?

662
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,060
Don't go using your
flirting tricks on the tavern girls

663
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,140
of your own family.

664
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,420
Let's go!

665
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,540
Go!

666
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,780
Giddy-up!

667
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,340
(Wei Mansion)

668
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,100
This way, please.

669
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,500
After you, Mr. Wei.

670
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,220
It's windy. Close the window.

671
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,020
He's so bossy.

672
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,220
His Lordship just doesn't get
Her Ladyship good intentions.

673
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,460
It's alright.

674
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,380
After this, he'll understand.

675
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,580
Xiaotao? Xiaotao!

676
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,060
Xiaotao!

677
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,060
- What's up?
- The road is rough.

678
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,460
If Her Ladyship's not feeling well,

679
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,340
tell me at once.

680
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,260
We can stop anytime.

681
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,860
No worries, Her Ladyship is fine.

682
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,740
Are you okay? Need anything?

683
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,020
Something to eat or drink?

684
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,860
Just say the word.

685
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,420
Me?

686
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,220
Just do your job.

687
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,340
Xiaotao?

688
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,420
Xiaotao?

689
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,900
Back then,

690
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,620
when we were heading to Yujun,

691
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,620
they rushed like crazy

692
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,900
and didn't care about Her Ladyship.

693
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,180
But now,

694
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,540
they're much more
considerate of Her Ladyship.

695
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,940
Exactly, My Lady.

696
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,460
Do you need anything to eat or any supplies?

697
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,060
Get me some water.

698
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,220
Here you are.

699
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
Here.

700
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,380
Come here. Sit.

701
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,020
This is rough fare. You can't eat it.

702
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,540
You can,

703
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,540
why can't I?

704
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,900
If you like it,

705
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,740
have another one.

706
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,180
Here.

707
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,580
Want some water?

708
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,860
It's good.

709
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,340
I told you

710
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,460
this journey wouldn't be easy.

711
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Told you not to come, but you insisted.

712
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,980
So what?

713
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,020
To see what you've seen,

714
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,860
walk where you've walked,

715
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,620
and stand by your side,

716
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,460
that's all been worth it.

717
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,140
The view's nice here.

718
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,020
Enjoy.

719
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,140
Still, there's one thing I can't figure out.

720
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,820
Even though Rongjun
is suffering from drought,

721
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,700
does delivering wheat seeds

722
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
really require you to go in person?

723
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,660
You've always made wise decisions.

724
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,580
Could you tell me why?

725
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,580
You don't always get it, huh?

726
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,580
I guess I was just

727
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,380
trying to be a bit clever before,

728
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,260
but mostly it was dumb luck.

729
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,580
My Lord, you've ruled Wei for years.

730
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,980
There's no way I can compare,

731
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,540
just a woman who's only read a few books.

732
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,100
If you don't tell me,

733
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,380
I might never get it.

734
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,340
Alright.

735
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,860
Since you want to know,

736
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,620
I'll tell you.

737
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,540
Bring me the panorama.

738
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,540
Come on.

739
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,420
Give it to me.

740
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
Take a look.

741
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,580
Rongjun's east of Yujun

742
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,700
(Liangya, Panyi, Wei State, Bianzhou)
and

743
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,540
borders Bianzhou.

744
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,540
Fifty years ago,

745
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,380
Rongjun wasn't part of Wei State.

746
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,540
When my great-grandfather ruled Wei State...

747
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,180
Those who surrendered after persuasion

748
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,140
were countless…

749
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,340
Why are you looking at me?

750
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Look at the panorama.

751
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,620
The land rises and falls,

752
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,060
but it's nothing like your strong features.

753
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,860
The mountains and rivers are lovely,

754
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,940
but they still can't match your spirit.

755
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,540
You're weird today.

756
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,900
Look at the panorama.

757
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,020
If you want to know why, stay focused.

758
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,580
The prefect of Rongjun

759
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
is nearly fifty,

760
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,380
born into

761
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,540
a noble local family.

762
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,260
However,

763
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,700
the canal construction

764
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
and farming

765
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,100
take a lot of manpower.

766
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,380
It could weaken his future standing.

767
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,220
He may not go for it.

768
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,620
That makes things tricky.

769
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,700
Yes, it does.

770
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,700
When the time comes,

771
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,220
we'll still need a proper plan

772
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,180
to persuade him.

773
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:45,860
Xiaotao.

774
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,820
Let me tell you something.

775
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,220
What is it?

776
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,140
There's a great place nearby.

777
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,820
The delicacies there

778
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,540
are absolutely delicious.

779
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,140
If only we can go and eat there.

780
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
How do you know that?

781
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,620
A good buddy of mine

782
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,220
gave me a guide.

783
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,460
The guide says it.

784
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,820
Don't you also wish

785
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,220
the Lord and the Lady

786
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,820
could grow a little closer?

787
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,340
Of course.

788
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,820
Look at them now.

789
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,620
It's so awkward.

790
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,820
The guide says

791
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,420
if we follow it on this journey,

792
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,900
their relationship

793
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,820
will definitely improve.
