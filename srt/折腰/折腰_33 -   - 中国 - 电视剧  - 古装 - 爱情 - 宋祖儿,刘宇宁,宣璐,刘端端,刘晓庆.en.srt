This is Lady Qiao,

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,130
my wife.

(Wei)

39
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,570
Everyone,

40
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,610
the Wei Clan suffered
a great catastrophe 15 years ago.

41
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,100
Our lineage dwindled,

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,490
and we declined more than once.

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,500
But today,
we have weathered the hardships

44
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,060
and risen again.

45
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,780
The suffering along the way

46
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,940
was not borne by me alone.

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,220
My grandmother and mother

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,060
have guided me with great care.

49
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,220
The support of all the clansmen

50
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,500
has also made today possible.

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,980
Here's a toast to you.

52
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
Beyond that,

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
there is one more person I must thank.

54
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,400
From this day on,

55
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,610
only the future matters to us,

56
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,540
not the past.

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,460
We'll share fortune and hardship

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,980
and stand together through trials.

59
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,850
Hatred is like a mountain.

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,170
If it remains in our hearts,

61
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,290
we cannot move forward.

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,690
Zhonglin,

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,010
it's good that you can remove

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
that mountain.

65
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,220
Thank you, Grandmother.

66
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,340
My Lady, the Lord is here.

67
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,060
Mother.

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
What's wrong?

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,930
Zhonglin,

70
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,890
there's something
about you and your wife

71
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,540
that I've been meaning
to say for a long time.

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,420
Today, let me tell you properly.

73
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,780
I was wondering what it could be.

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm busy at the office.

75
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,940
Let's talk later.

76
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,540
It won't take long.

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,420
I know you two are in love now,

78
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,660
but how will you

79
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,100
make her utterly devoted to you?

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,540
We've already talked

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,260
about Lady Qiao more than once.

82
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,900
I have my own judgment.

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
You don't.

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,060
I...

85
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,660
If you don't want your marriage
to sour over time,

86
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,900
you two

87
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,620
must have a child.

88
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,860
So, that's what this is about.

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,260
She and I

90
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,620
have already talked it over.

91
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,660
Talking isn't enough.

92
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,900
The clansmen think
as long as you're in love,

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,060
descendants will follow.

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,980
I disagree.

95
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,300
Why?

96
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,060
Tell me.

97
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,260
Because of the mourning period,

98
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
you two haven't shared a bed

99
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,740
for a whole year, right?

100
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,480
I...

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,260
Where are the kids
supposed to come from?

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,820
I have a way.

103
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,580
Wait, you have a way?

104
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,500
That was because of the mourning period.

105
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,340
So we...

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,060
There's no need for you to worry.

107
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,900
Take this.

108
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,900
Actually, back in Kangjun, she and I...

109
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,100
Children come by fate.

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,500
What fate?

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,180
It depends on effort.

112
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,140
I specially got this for you.

113
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,500
What...

114
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,460
What is it?

115
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,540
I heard

116
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,700
that if the wife

117
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,060
puts on clothes or personal items

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,180
worn by a pregnant woman

119
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,860
in recent months,

120
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,380
she'll catch the good luck

121
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,980
and soon conceive.

122
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,700
You believe that?

123
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,980
I can tell Lady Qiao

124
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,340
wants a child.

125
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,060
So, I asked around early on.

126
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,140
This woman can bear children,

127
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,300
but her husband is a butcher,

128
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,460
so there's a bit of blood smell.

129
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,580
But it doesn't matter.

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,620
Take it back,

131
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,020
put it under the bed,

132
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,860
and don't say a word.

133
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,660
It's for good luck.

134
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,220
Will this really work?

135
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,980
Of course.

136
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,180
Time flies.

137
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,300
The Lord and the Lady

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,740
have been married for over a year.

139
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,140
Yes.

140
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,540
It's been over a year
since we got soaked

141
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,220
in the rain outside the city.

142
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Here we go again.

143
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,180
Do you have to bring that up every year?

144
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,100
Besides, I pleaded for you
with the Lord back then.

145
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,380
You even said

146
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
that you'd serve whoever

147
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,580
pleaded for you

148
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,660
with all your heart.

149
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,500
Are you asking me to serve you?

150
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,580
Come on.

151
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,780
No need for that.

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Just marry me.

153
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,460
You want to marry me?

154
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,140
Before I went off to war last time,

155
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,980
I promised I'd ask your mother
for approval.

156
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,780
I've fought beside the Lord for years

157
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,140
and risen from a foot soldier
to a general.

158
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,020
Once I've saved enough wages,

159
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,100
I'll have the Lord ask

160
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,720
for your mother's approval on my behalf.

161
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,820
Why do you need to save up first?

162
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,260
How much do you need?

163
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,540
The more, the better.

164
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,460
You don't even have a number in mind.

165
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,340
What if you spend
more than what you earn?

166
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,380
Do I have to wait forever then?

167
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,700
Are you serious about this?

168
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,300
I am serious about marrying you.

169
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,020
The more I save,

170
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,700
the bigger the betrothal gift.

171
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,900
I don't need that.

172
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,540
- I have to save.
- No need.

173
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,110
- I insist.
- No need.

174
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,020
I have to save.

175
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
Why are you so stubborn?

176
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,100
I don't know whether to call you devoted

177
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,540
or just thick-headed.

178
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,820
I said I didn't need it.

179
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,660
It's done.

180
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,620
What's wrong?

181
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,180
Take your time saving.

182
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,540
I'm not in a rush anyway.

183
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,300
The meat's not done.
Where are you going?

184
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,440
You've fed me full of anger.

185
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,100
Tao, you look good.

186
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,780
Why is she suddenly upset?

187
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,860
Great food.

188
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,540
Let me try some.

189
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,860
No, no, no.

190
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,580
That's for Xiaotao.

191
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,100
You eat those.

192
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,820
All you ever think about is food.

193
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,380
Don't you get what she was saying?

194
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
What do you mean?

195
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,860
She's eager to marry you.

196
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,220
What to do then?

197
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,260
Do you still have your wages?

198
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,500
Lend me some.

199
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,540
No. Let's eat.

200
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,940
The richest man in this place
is sitting in the office.

201
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,260
Ask him, not me.

202
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,380
Go on.

203
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,620
I heard

204
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,780
that if the wife

205
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,140
puts on clothes or personal items

206
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,260
worn by a pregnant woman

207
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,740
in recent months,

208
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,460
she'll catch the good luck

209
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,980
and soon conceive.

210
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,620
Mr. Gongsun.

211
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,580
My Lord.

212
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
What do you need?

213
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,420
I want to ask you

214
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,020
if there's been any movements
near Boya lately.

215
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Probably not.

216
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,780
I believe there are.

217
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,860
After this battle,

218
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,780
I realize relying on Xiaogang alone

219
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,180
is not enough to protect Panyi.

220
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
Panyi is a key hub for the channel.

221
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
Every lord wants it.

222
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,380
It must not fall.

223
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,020
Now,

224
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,180
with the Qiao-Wei alliance,

225
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,220
I want to join forces with Boya

226
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
to reinforce our military

227
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,260
and secure Panyi together.

228
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,780
Mr. Gongsun,

229
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,180
what do you think?

230
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,620
It makes sense.

231
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,660
But there's no rush.

232
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,220
We can wait until we've entertained

233
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,500
- all the state lords.
- No.

234
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
I believe this

235
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,820
must be done quickly.

236
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm in a hurry.

237
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,300
And I need to figure out

238
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,500
who to send.

239
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,020
Whom do you plan to send?

240
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,820
My Lord.

241
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,180
My Lord, Mr. Gongsun.

242
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,220
My Lord, I have a request.

243
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,100
Hold on.

244
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,940
You're just in time.

245
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,860
I was telling Mr. Gongsun

246
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,540
that I plan to reinforce Boya.

247
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,780
You'll go deliver

248
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,620
the supplies on my behalf.

249
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,340
Any objections?

250
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,780
- I...
- Good. It's settled.

251
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,200
You leave immediately.

252
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,980
Yes.

253
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,660
Also,

254
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,820
there's one more thing.

255
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,580
While you're there,

256
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,820
ask the Commander's wife

257
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,580
for two pieces of her personal clothing.

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,300
Tell her the Lady misses her

259
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,440
and wants a token of comfort.

260
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,100
Got that?

261
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,940
Yes.

262
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,080
Make sure it's something

263
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,340
she's worn in the last few months.

264
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,040
Yes.

265
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,900
Also,

266
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,460
if she has any baby clothes

267
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,700
or toys set aside,

268
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,050
bring back a few.

269
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,100
No need to ask questions.

270
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,020
Just take them.

271
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,460
Yes.

272
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Also...

273
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,940
If I think of anything else,
I'll let you know.

274
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,100
Now go.

275
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,100
Yes.

276
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,980
This character Li is good,

277
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,980
but it means departure.

278
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm afraid it'd be unlucky.

279
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
No.

280
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,660
Feng?

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,020
I remember

282
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,260
that I once knew someone who had Feng
in his name.

283
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,980
His fate was full of hardship.

284
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,100
Not good either.

285
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,420
Qiuri...

286
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,420
It means autumn that feels bleak.
Not good.

287
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,060
Have some water, My Lady.

288
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,220
It's only been a few days' delay
in your period,

289
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,780
and you're already picking baby names.

290
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,420
It's a tough decision.

291
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,980
Why not get the Lord to help you?

292
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,820
It's not certain yet.

293
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,900
I'll tell him once I'm sure.

294
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,980
Your tastes have changed lately.

295
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,220
I'd say

296
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,220
there's a high chance.

297
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,700
Maybe you're carrying

298
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,420
a little lady.

299
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,660
(Boya)

300
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,180
General.

301
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
General, why such a rush?

302
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,060
Good thing you sent word in advance.

303
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,220
The Lord said
I must go and return swiftly

304
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,260
without delay.

305
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,900
Has your wife prepared it?

306
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,780
Please, this way.

307
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,620
This way.

308
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,220
This garment won't do.

309
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,980
The embroidery is worn.

310
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,020
Not this one either.

311
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,900
My Lady.

312
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,980
What do you think of these?

313
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,340
This hairpin is way too intricate.

314
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,060
The gold thread is blinding.

315
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,360
Xing, put away these tacky things.

316
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,620
The Lord of Wei treats her well.

317
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,260
She has no shortage of these.

318
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,140
We need to choose something exquisite

319
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,900
that she truly likes.

320
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,580
My Lady, that won't do.

321
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,460
The general made this for you.

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,980
I remember

323
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,340
on the day she helped me
and Bi Zhi escape,

324
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,420
she teased me,

325
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,220
saying she liked my konghou.

326
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,580
When you heard

327
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,460
it was for the Lady,

328
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,500
you nearly turned

329
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
the entire storeroom inside out.

330
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,380
In that case,

331
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,140
why didn't you speak frankly

332
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,030
with the Lady

333
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,060
and clear the misunderstandings?

334
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,780
The closer you get,

335
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,540
the harder it is to say that.

336
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,700
Fan,

337
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,620
you're almost due.

338
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,260
Why do this yourself?

339
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,300
Others don't know Manman's tastes.

340
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,100
General Wei Liang said

341
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,580
a few ordinary clothes would do.

342
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,860
The last time Manman
asked me for things,

343
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,820
it was when you and I escaped.

344
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,980
She picked out many things I like.

345
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,500
This time,

346
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,820
I want to pick some for her too.

347
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,180
Fan,

348
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
you're so kind.

349
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,980
No rush.

350
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,300
Let's take our time choosing.

351
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,540
(Chijun, Liangya)

352
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,540
My Lord,

353
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,540
three factions among our allies

354
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,940
have turned to Wei.

355
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,740
I will make those traitors

356
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
pay the price.

357
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,980
But right now,
we need rest and recovery.

358
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,780
Liangya can't endure more turmoil.

359
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,340
Though Lady Yulou

360
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,900
was worth more

361
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
than Xiaoqiao back then

362
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,900
and brought us 50,000 troops,

363
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,660
she incited the attack on Panyi,

364
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,420
which caused our huge losses today.

365
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,700
It's not her fault.

366
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,260
I intended to attack anyway.

367
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,340
But it wasn't meant to be so rushed.

368
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,700
Ultimately, it's her fault.

369
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,100
You mustn't indulge her anymore.

370
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,260
You're the one I'm indulging.

371
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,820
My Lord,

372
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,900
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,900
I know my mistake.

374
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,740
My Lord,

375
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,980
now,

376
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,780
will Lady Yulou

377
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,140
betray you

378
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,300
after such a great defeat?

379
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,320
Most of Wei Shao's forces

380
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,100
were tied down
at the canal construction.

381
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,620
Yet Liu Yan still lost.

382
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,980
I think he's useless.

383
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,180
If General Lin's troops
had arrived on time,

384
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,780
he might win.

385
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,180
But now,

386
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,820
I think they're scared.

387
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,660
We should return to Juejun.

388
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,940
You've protected me so well.

389
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,900
If my husband knew,

390
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,700
he'd be relieved.

391
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,540
But I promised him

392
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,380
I'd fight for this land.

393
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,940
Though he's gone,

394
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,020
I must not break my word.

395
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,620
Why do you value
the Lord of Liangya so much?

396
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,060
It's not that.

397
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,340
I just have no other choice.

398
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,500
Who else can stand

399
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,820
against Wei Shao now?

400
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,580
If I want to unite the states

401
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,700
to resist Wei,

402
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,060
someone must take the lead.

403
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,220
Then let's see if he dares.

404
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,820
I won't let him give up.

405
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Lady Yulou.

406
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,460
The Lord is handling affairs.

407
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,060
How dare you barge in like this?

408
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,780
My Lady, why are you here?

409
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,020
I'm betrothed to you.

410
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,060
Have you forgotten?

411
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,900
I planned

412
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,780
to take this realm as my betrothal gift.

413
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,700
I thought to wait

414
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,940
until you win to marry you.

415
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,540
But now,

416
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,940
it seems the time is right.

417
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,060
What do you mean?

418
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,820
Last night, I had a dream.

419
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,060
In a trance,

420
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,660
a golden light fell from the beams,

421
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,900
circling several times,

422
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,420
and then transformed into a dragon,

423
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,860
whipping its tail over Liangya.

424
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,700
When I woke, I knew

425
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,620
the time had come.

426
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,060
Dreams

427
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,980
can't be taken seriously.

428
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,460
You're trapped in Liangya

429
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,260
like a dragon trapped in shallow waters.

430
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,140
I want to marry you

431
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,740
to help you

432
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,100
rise swiftly

433
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,220
and become the ruler of all.

434
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,340
But I just lost to Wei Shao.

435
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,380
You didn't lose because you were weak

436
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,260
but because you didn't understand

437
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,260
Wei Shao or the Qiao Clan

438
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,340
and misplaced your strength.

439
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,220
I've been twice to Yujun

440
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,420
to break

441
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,980
the Qiao-Wei alliance.

442
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,380
But I chose the wrong target.

443
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,020
Once the Wei Clan trusts an ally

444
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
or kin,

445
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,180
they're open and loyal.

446
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,620
However, the Qiao Clan

447
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
sways with the wind.

448
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,620
They're easier to break
than the Lord of Wei.

449
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,060
You should start with the Qiao Clan.

450
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,340
It's easier

451
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,780
to deal a heavy blow to Wei Shao.

452
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,020
In that case,

453
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,740
Lady Yulou,

454
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,700
why not visit the Qiao Clan yourself

455
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,580
- to lobby them?
- The Qiaos aren't enough.

456
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,500
I'm willing to go

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,980
to the other states for you,

458
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,180
explain the stakes,

459
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,860
and persuade them

460
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,140
to join Liangya

461
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,740
to fight against Wei.

462
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,820
I am willing to marry you

463
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,700
and give my utmost to assist you.

464
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,620
I only hope you will soon rise

465
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,500
and claim the Central Plains.

466
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Since you trust me,

467
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,580
I will not let you down.

468
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,540
If I gain the realm,

469
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
I will share it with you.

470
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,740
My Lord,

471
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,140
I was born with a most auspicious fate.

472
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,620
But my nosewings

473
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,660
are blocking my fortune.

474
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,740
Only the element of gold

475
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,980
can break it.

476
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,540
So, I wear this golden butterfly mask.

477
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,140
My Lord.

478
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,580
Our troops are still resting.

479
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,780
We must not act rashly.

480
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,220
I've told you

481
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,180
that you're only my servant.

482
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,580
If you forget that again,

483
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,740
I'll send you underground

484
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,060
so my father can teach you
the meaning of rank.

485
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,780
Understood.

486
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,420
(Wei Mansion, Wei)

487
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,860
General Wei Liang, you're back.

488
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,820
Xiaotao's not here.

489
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,340
Well.

490
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
Where did she go then?

491
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,180
She's attending to the Lady.

492
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,740
But I asked around.

493
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,100
Xiaozao is on duty today.

494
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,500
Then she must be at the laundry.

495
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,180
I checked the laundry too.

496
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,820
No one went to do the laundry.

497
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,460
Then she went shopping.

498
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,860
But I just came from the streets.

499
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,300
I looked everywhere.

500
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,140
Just now,
I saw someone with a bun go in.

501
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,980
That has to be...

502
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,100
That has to be her.

503
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,060
What do you mean?

504
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,700
Why are you talking to me here?

505
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,300
Listen.

506
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,580
I'm Xiaotao's mother.

507
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,940
If you upset me,

508
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,220
I won't let her marry you

509
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,620
even if she wants to.

510
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,020
Now leave.

511
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,060
Go.

512
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,380
Mother,

513
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,780
let me talk to him.

514
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,700
Xiaotao,

515
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,460
don't be mad.

516
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,500
I left in a hurry.

517
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,460
The Lord was in a rush.

518
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,260
I came looking for you
as soon as I got back.

519
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,460
I even asked the Lord for reward money.

520
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,940
I've been saving it.

521
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,980
Then,

522
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,900
is it enough?

523
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,940
Almost.

524
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,860
Almost?

525
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,730
So,

526
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,420
when will it be enough?

527
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,780
Almost there.

528
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,540
I don't need much.

529
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,700
It's not like I want a house
or anything.

530
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,020
You want a house?

531
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,420
Then keep waiting.

532
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,220
I said I didn't want one.

533
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,840
Once I've saved enough, I'll come back.

534
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,260
Mother,

535
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,620
he left again.

536
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,300
What a fool.

537
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,700
He's not a fool.

538
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
He values you.

539
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,060
He's afraid he's not worthy of you,

540
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,660
so he wants to do more.

541
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,380
Only then will he feel at ease.

542
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,500
I like

543
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,700
this son-in-law.

544
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Why are you back so early?

545
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,060
I came back for a belt.

546
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,940
Do you need to change it?

547
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,180
Did the old one break?

548
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,180
No.

549
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,660
I just don't like it.

550
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,140
Help me find the one

551
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,140
with the phoenix embroidery.

552
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,580
Since when do you care about that?

553
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,860
Thanks.

554
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,500
You seem to have been

555
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,260
so tired lately.

556
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,820
I do feel worn out.

557
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,260
Then rest more.

558
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,980
There's nothing going on here anyway.

559
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,030
You don't have to check in

560
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,420
with Grandmother or Mother.

561
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,500
Sleep in.

562
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,700
I can't sleep.

563
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
Also,

564
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,540
I keep feeling sick and nauseous.

565
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,140
Maybe you ate something bad.

566
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,740
I'll get the physician.

567
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,820
No need.

568
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,540
Chunniang said

569
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,460
she was like this
when pregnant with Xiaotao.

570
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,140
That's not the same.

571
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,420
That's pregnancy.

572
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,780
You're throwing up and tired,

573
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,740
and you haven't had your period
in a while.

574
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,300
It must be something you ate.

575
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,340
You remember my time of the month?

576
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,660
Of course.

577
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
I'll call the physician.

578
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
What's wrong?

579
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,860
Since you remember my time of the month,

580
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,740
haven't you thought
of other possibilities?

581
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,940
I...

582
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,740
No way.

583
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,700
Is it really that effective?

584
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Nothing.

585
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,300
I'm just so happy.

586
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,100
Chunniang said

587
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,340
it felt like a girl.

588
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,620
Either a boy or a girl is great.

589
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,700
I like girls.

590
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,060
But I haven't picked

591
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,900
a name for her.

592
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,020
I've looked through so many books

593
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,780
but found nothing that fits.

594
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,740
How about I ask Grandmother

595
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
when I visit her tomorrow?

596
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,460
I remember

597
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,900
a mythical beast from Mount Huo

598
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,260
was called Feifei.

599
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,700
They say whoever raises it

600
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,220
lives a carefree life.

601
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,060
Why don't we use Feifei

602
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,380
as the child's pet name?

603
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,700
I hope

604
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,980
you and our child

605
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,540
can both live free from worry.

606
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,620
Is that okay?

607
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,420
Feifei.

608
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,900
That sounds lovely.

609
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,780
What's on your mind?

610
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,620
I'm thinking...

611
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,900
Now we're a family of three.

612
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,700
And maybe we'll have more kids.

613
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,100
I once promised you

614
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,740
that I'd bring prosperity
to your family.

615
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,220
I won't break that promise.

616
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,500
Once the canals

617
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,860
reach all directions,

618
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,440
bringing blessings to the people,

619
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,540
trade will flourish,
and wealth will be flowing.

620
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,140
I believe by then,

621
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,580
there will be no more war,

622
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,460
and the people will live in peace.

623
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
Let it be our gift

624
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,260
to bless our child

625
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,260
and the future of Wei.

626
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,900
May our child

627
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,580
live in an age of peace.

628
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,500
They will.

629
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,700
Manman,

630
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,100
a man of the Wei Clan

631
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,820
never turns back

632
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,980
once he's made up his mind.

633
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,780
In this life,

634
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,380
I won't fail you.

635
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,620
(Kangjun Wharf)

636
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,180
(Kangjun, Yanzhou)

637
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,420
Let's keep going in Kangjun.

638
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,260
Keep singing.

639
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,100
Louder!

640
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,260
- Okay.
- Hurry!

641
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,100
Circle around more.

642
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,410
Go.

643
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
One chi of cloth

644
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,180
can be sewn.

645
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,460
One peck of grain

646
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,260
can be pounded.

647
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,300
But two brothers

648
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,340
can't get along.

649
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,500
Prefect Qiao

650
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,380
is good at medicine.

651
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Governor Qiao

652
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,460
is full of envy.

653
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,420
Prefect Qiao

654
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,500
knows right from wrong.

655
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,540
Governor Qiao

656
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,620
is a cowardly turtle.

657
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,700
Prefect Qiao

658
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,700
is wise and just.

659
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,820
Governor Qiao

660
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,180
is useless and timid.

661
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,220
(Kangjun Wharf)

662
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,260
(Useless and timid)

663
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,940
Outrageous!

664
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,300
Calm down, My Lord.

665
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,820
It's just some nonsense

666
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,340
that bratty kids made up.

667
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,940
Could kids come up with that?

668
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,740
Someone is spreading this,

669
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,060
trying to slander me.

670
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
My Lord,

671
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,420
given the situation,

672
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,900
even if you punish me now,

673
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,460
I must say this.

674
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,580
If you let these schemers

675
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,420
continue to run wild,

676
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,340
you and Yanzhou

677
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,700
may be

678
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,460
in danger.

679
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,020
What do you mean?

680
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
My Lord,

681
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,460
you're the Governor of Yanzhou,

682
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,420
respected greatly.

683
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,900
But lately, when people talk of Yanzhou,

684
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,140
they only mention Qiao Ping,
the Kangjun Prefect.

685
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,580
Who even brings up your name?

686
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,060
Even the kids in Yanzhou

687
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,220
are spreading that ridiculous song.

688
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,620
My Lord, you're kind

689
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,940
and loyal to your brother,

690
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,300
but I

691
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,780
worry

692
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,900
for you.

693
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,660
Now, the Lady of Wei is pregnant.

694
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,500
When she gives birth

695
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,380
to the heir,

696
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,660
the prefect will become
the heir's maternal grandfather.

697
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,460
By then,

698
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,740
your position

699
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
will be in jeopardy.

700
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,660
(Mansion of the Lord of Liangya,
Liangya)

701
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,860
Now,

702
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,180
everything is ready.

703
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,100
My Lord,

704
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,340
may you win in Kangjun.

705
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
My Lady,

706
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,740
may you succeed in your mission.

707
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Liu Xiao.

708
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,980
My Lord.

709
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,500
Take 5,000 guards.

710
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,380
Keep the Lady safe at all costs.

711
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,500
Yes.

712
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,580
My Lord,

713
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,620
may you win.

714
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,540
I won't let you down.

715
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,980
(Mansion of the Lord of Liangya)

716
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,180
Tell the troops:

717
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,180
Let's depart.

718
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,080
Yes.

719
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Depart!

720
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,380
Father,

721
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,340
run!

722
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,540
Run!

723
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,500
Manman.

724
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,220
Manman?

725
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,180
Father...

726
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,820
Manman, wake up.

727
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,660
Run!

728
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,580
What's wrong?

729
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,340
What happened?

730
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,660
I dreamed

731
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,500
my father and I were out in the wild.

732
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,380
Behind him were several wolves,

733
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,300
staring at him like prey.

734
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,060
But he didn't even notice.

735
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,580
I kept calling him,
but he couldn't hear me.

736
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,620
It was just a dream.

737
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Maybe

738
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,220
the baby was moving

739
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,500
and upset you.

740
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,940
Maybe.

741
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,940
How about this?

742
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,660
If you're really that worried,

743
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,500
I'll send someone

744
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,500
to bring Father here

745
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,980
to live with us for a while.

746
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,080
He can also be here
when the baby is born.

747
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Really?

748
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,660
Yes.

749
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,820
There's no war in Yanzhou right now.

750
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,060
He doesn't need to guard there.

751
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,220
He can come and live with us

752
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,660
to enjoy some family time.

753
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,860
You're so good to me.

754
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,140
Alright, go back to sleep.

755
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,260
I'll figure out who to send tomorrow.

756
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,100
Tao, Tao.

757
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,820
Once I've saved enough for a house,

758
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,780
I'll come and marry you.

759
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,280
You still want to marry me?

760
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,740
I thought you didn't want to anymore.

761
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,620
Of course, I do.

762
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,380
At the rate you're saving,

763
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,900
we'll get married in ten years.

764
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,900
I promise.

765
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,380
I'll save faster

766
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,380
and marry you soon.

767
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,340
Do you think the moon is big?

768
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,740
Yes.

769
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,420
It's not as big as your dreams.

770
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,500
Tao,

771
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,580
I can save for the betrothal gift

772
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,440
and the house.

773
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,740
But I can't get the moon for you.

774
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,740
What do I need the moon for?

775
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,580
Well.

776
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,700
I can save up

777
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,140
for the betrothal gift and the house.

778
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,660
What else do you want me to save for?

779
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,840
I can save up together.

780
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,140
Still saving?

781
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,860
It's been ages.

782
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,140
Are you making me propose to you?

783
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,540
Will that work?

784
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,220
Of course not.

785
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,680
What do you want me to save for then?

786
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,020
Why don't you get it?

787
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,220
Look at the Lord.

788
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,300
When he proposed to the Lady,

789
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,660
he hunted a lynx for her.

790
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,900
That's impressive.

791
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,540
I'm going now.

792
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,380
Come back.

793
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,580
I don't want a lynx.

794
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,420
Then...

795
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,700
Come here, come on.

796
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,500
See that?

797
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,060
The lamp stove?

798
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,860
You look like a lamp stove.

799
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,420
Look to your left.

800
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
What is it?

801
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,580
The orchid.

802
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,700
Oh, the orchid.

803
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,420
That's an orchid from Yanzhou.

804
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,060
Mr. Wei gave it to the Lady back then.

805
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,580
She poured boiling water on it.

806
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,220
I thought it died.

807
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,780
But it has grown new buds lately.

808
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,860
Amazing, right?

809
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,420
When it blooms, it's really beautiful.

810
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,500
I've been taking care of it every day.

811
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,700
It's my favorite thing right now.

812
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
I know how you feel about me.

813
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,020
You want me to live well.

814
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,300
But I really don't care
about money or houses.

815
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,900
Besides, I earn more than you.

816
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,580
If you really want to marry me,

817
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,180
just give me this orchid.

818
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,940
Your sincerity is
the best betrothal gift.

819
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,780
Fetching the Lord's father-in-law
from Yanzhou...

820
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,740
What kind of job is that?

821
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,780
Same old rule.

822
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,540
Whoever loses goes.

823
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,700
What rule?

824
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,120
The Lord picked you.

825
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,140
No need for grass straws.

826
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,820
When did he say that?

827
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,860
Didn't he say we'd decide together?

828
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,420
What are you staring at?

829
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,380
Can't you see that big thing?

830
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,740
- What is it?
- Look closely.

831
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,180
The moon?

832
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,340
Where were you just now?

833
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,340
Xiaotao said

834
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,660
the betrothal gift is a Yanzhou orchid.

835
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,180
Once I get it to fully bloom,

836
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,580
she'll marry me.

837
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,060
Liang,

838
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,940
I've got just the task for you.

839
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,820
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

840
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,660
What is it?

841
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,140
The Lord needs someone

842
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,460
to go to Yanzhou
and bring back his father-in-law.

843
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,020
You go

844
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,460
and bring back an orchid too.

845
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,060
Then you can marry Xiaotao.

846
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,100
But I already have one.

847
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,340
That's not the same.

848
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,500
That's the one Mr. Wei gave to the Lady.

849
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,540
Don't think I don't know.

850
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,220
You can't use that one if you're serious
about marrying Xiaotao.

851
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,500
If you really give her that,

852
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,740
I'd feel sorry for her.

853
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,940
- Wei Xiao.
- Well.

854
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,620
- Don't you think so?
- Stop.

855
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,000
Don't drag me into tricking him.

856
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,880
I'm not tricking him.

857
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,500
Duo, you're too young for this.

858
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,560
Just tell him the truth.

859
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,540
If you believe so.

860
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,060
We have to trick someone anyway.

861
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm not tricking him.

862
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,180
Don't listen to them.

863
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,700
Let me analyze it for you.

864
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,140
With your clumsy hands,

865
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,380
how long would it take you

866
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,500
to grow a blooming orchid?

867
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,020
You know the road to Kangjun.

868
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,500
It's a short trip.

869
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,920
If you go to Kangjun,

870
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,620
you can bring back
the Lord's father-in-law

871
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,660
and pick up an orchid on the way.

872
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,460
Then you can marry Xiaotao
when you're back.

873
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,420
It makes sense.

874
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,060
Look at Wei Qu.

875
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,340
Then look at you two,

876
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,100
always tricking me.

877
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
The moon really is big tonight.

878
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,740
How long has it been

879
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,700
since we watched the moon together?

880
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,940
There will be more chances.

881
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,780
Yeah.

882
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,300
When you come back,

883
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,380
Xiaotao will be watching the moon
with you.

884
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,220
(Yujun)

885
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,500
Liang, safe travels.

886
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,700
Show me some respect.

887
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,460
Don't come back all skinny.

888
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,310
I won't.

889
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,180
I mean your horse.

890
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,380
Go away.

891
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,340
Listen to your brothers.

892
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,460
- Bye.
- Bye.

893
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,320
Take care.

894
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,260
Wei Liang.

895
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,620
What are you doing here?

896
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,460
You're really going to Yanzhou?

897
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,820
What for?

898
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,300
To bring back the Lady's father.

899
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,580
He'll live here for a while.

900
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,220
There's nothing else?

901
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,260
I'll go and pick a real Yanzhou orchid

902
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
to marry you.

903
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,990
Goodbye.

904
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Be careful on the road.

905
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,900
Hyah.

906
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,660
Hyah.

907
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,460
(Qiao Mansion, Yanzhou)

908
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,100
Who exactly
did you call me here to meet?

909
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,420
My Lord,
if you want to turn things around now,

910
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,580
this is the only one who can help.

911
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,940
Who might that be?

912
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,220
I...

913
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,540
