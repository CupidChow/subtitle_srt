This is

68
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,310
too absurd.

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,580
I've indeed been busy with work.

70
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,950
Besides, the physician just said

71
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,830
she was fine.

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,550
Mr. Gongsun, you needn't worry.

73
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,190
You left your injured bride
outside the city for days,

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,540
exposed to wind and dew.

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,460
If word of this reaches
the people of Yanzhou,

76
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,580
it'll only disgrace you.

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,780
In my opinion,

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,260
once the Lady wakes up,

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,300
you should offer a proper apology.

80
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,940
My Lady.

81
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,140
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

82
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,780
Here. Slowly, slowly.

83
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,420
My Lady, you're finally awake.

84
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,020
How long did I sleep?

85
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,020
Two days and one night.

86
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,180
My Lady, you must be hungry.

87
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,420
Xiaotao has gone to the kitchen
to prepare food.

88
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,420
Soon, you'll have warm congee.

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,620
Where is this?

90
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,780
This is the Lord's bedchamber.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,160
Earlier, you were burning with fever
and unconscious.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,900
The Lord summoned the physician.

93
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,300
But after the physician left,

94
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,340
another person called Zheng Shu came,

95
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,460
saying the Lord doesn't like others
in his main chamber

96
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
and Lady Zhu

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,220
asked you to move to the side chamber.

98
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,780
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

99
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,780
My Lord.

100
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,600
Are you feeling better?

101
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,780
Much better.

102
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,220
As the head of the Wei family,

103
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,500
you shoulder its honor and disgrace.

104
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,820
Still, you insisted on marrying me.

105
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
These past few days

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,620
must've been hard for you.

107
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,940
Good that you understand.

108
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,580
This is Yujun, not Kangjun.

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,500
Things like this

110
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,300
will happen often from now on.

111
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,020
Yes.

112
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,540
I'll call someone

113
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,980
to prepare a couch.

114
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,540
No need.

115
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,620
Earlier, Mother sent someone

116
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,140
called Zheng Shu here,

117
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,700
saying she had arranged

118
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,620
another place for me to rest.

119
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,300
My Lord, I was just about to ask you

120
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,260
if you know

121
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,300
where the side chamber is

122
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,820
and how far it is.

123
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,140
Side chamber?

124
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,820
My Lord, no need to worry.

125
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,580
I've only caught a chill.

126
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,020
I can still manage

127
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,500
a few steps.

128
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,660
At worst,

129
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,780
I'll drink more medicine tomorrow.

130
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,900
My Lord, please

131
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,780
send someone

132
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,380
to point me the way.

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,380
As for my hand,

134
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,300
thanks to the Healing Powder from you,

135
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,300
it should be healed in a few days.

136
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,260
My Lord,

137
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,180
please wait a moment

138
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,940
while I tidy up.

139
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,420
Wait...

140
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,340
You go rest in bed.

141
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,380
I'll go to the side chamber.

142
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,100
Thank you for your concern.

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,340
Then I will

144
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,380
rest for now.

145
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,260
My Lord,

146
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,980
you should rest early too.

147
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,140
My Lady.

148
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,860
Has he gone?

149
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,160
So, My Lady,

150
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,740
should we still go to the side chamber

151
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,700
as Zheng Shu arranged?

152
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,540
No.

153
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,340
They left me outside the city
for three days.

154
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,620
If I just obey

155
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,860
like this,

156
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,860
how could I be the Lady of Wei?

157
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,100
Zhonglin brought Lady Qiao
back to the room?

158
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,220
She acted all delicate

159
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,820
to win Shao's pity.

160
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,420
You haven't even met,

161
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,220
yet she's made Shao defy your wishes

162
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,460
and brought her in.

163
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
If this goes on...

164
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,780
She'll be a disaster.

165
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,500
Aunt, you need not worry.

166
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,980
I followed
the Grand Sorcerer's instructions

167
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,020
and placed Lady Qiao

168
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,660
in a distant side chamber

169
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,820
far from Shao's main chamber.

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,940
(Wei Mansion, Wei State)

171
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,800
You made such splendid clothes.

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,780
Once the Lord sees them,

173
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,980
he'll surely praise
your skill and cleverness.

174
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
I don't even know if they fit.

175
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,300
It's been months since we met,

176
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,580
so I could only go
by Shao's old measurements.

177
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,500
We're really out of luck.

178
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,620
Normally, we just clean chamber pots,

179
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,820
but now we have

180
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,060
to serve Lady Qiao.

181
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Exactly.

182
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,320
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

183
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,460
There is

184
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,540
no one else in this room.

185
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,020
Where did Lady Qiao

186
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,780
sleep last night?

187
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,420
Shao...

188
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,540
What?

189
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,660
Lady Qiao slept in the main chamber

190
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,940
and made Zhonglin sleep
in the side chamber?

191
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,340
This is outrageous.

192
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,300
How dare she treat my son like this!

193
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,060
Just a few days ago,
Shao went out in person

194
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,460
to carry Lady Qiao into the mansion.

195
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,540
She must've become arrogant
with his favor.

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,340
Is this household

197
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,580
still named Wei?

198
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,860
(Xindu)

199
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,380
Congratulations, My Lord.

200
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,460
The Yongning Canal project
has started smoothly.

201
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,900
Once the water flows through,
it'll surely benefit the people.

202
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,340
It's a great deed in the present

203
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,220
and a blessing for generations.

204
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,820
Wei Liang, listen.

205
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,660
Yes.

206
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,580
Prepare 3,000 elite troops

207
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,760
to be stationed in Panyi now.

208
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,660
- Well...
- Several states

209
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,820
are wary of Panyi.

210
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,420
Besides, 14 years ago,

211
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,580
the war started
because of the Yongning Canal.

212
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,220
Though I now have a fearsome reputation,

213
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,260
and they dare not attack us easily,

214
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,260
we should still prepare in advance.

215
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,300
Stationing troops in Panyi

216
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,540
will

217
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,860
guard the canal.

218
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,340
It can also

219
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,780
intimidate Yanzhou,

220
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,800
so one day...

221
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,780
One day we can strike.

222
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,900
My Lord, you just married Lady Qiao.

223
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,060
Peace was recently restored
between Wei and Yanzhou.

224
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,860
If we station troops now,

225
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,220
it may panic the Qiao family.

226
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,260
It could destabilize
the current situation.

227
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,300
I don't care.

228
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,900
The Qiao family

229
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
has always acted timidly.

230
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,940
Well...

231
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,940
What will the Lady think

232
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,500
when she hears of this?

233
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,380
How will you and she

234
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,500
continue living together

235
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,140
as a couple?

236
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,340
I already told her when we married

237
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,780
that she'd only be a Wei

238
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,860
instead of a Qiao.

239
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,180
Besides,

240
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
I have no time to worry about that now.

241
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,740
Xiaotao,

242
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,140
how did your scouting go
in the city today?

243
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,860
I checked out a few shops.

244
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,340
I'll go talk to them in a few days.

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,420
Good.

246
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,060
Didn't she say she'd move out today?

247
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,260
You haven't done packing?

248
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,220
My Lord.

249
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
My Lord...

250
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,500
What's wrong?

251
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,740
Weren't you feeling better?

252
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,260
You may not know.

253
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,420
When I visited Mother today,

254
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,220
I wanted to seem more presentable,

255
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,100
so I ate some mint leaves

256
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,300
to help with the coughing.

257
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,540
I don't know

258
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,380
if they've clashed
with the cold medicine

259
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,540
from the physician.

260
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,500
Now, my cough's getting worse.

261
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,540
Chunniang, go fetch the physician.

262
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,780
Hurry.

263
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,980
No need.

264
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,460
I can't keep disturbing your rest.

265
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,620
So, I had Chunniang

266
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,900
pack our things early.

267
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,100
We'll go to the side chamber now.

268
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,740
Do you want some water?

269
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,580
Carry all the luggage now.

270
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,940
- Give me it.
- Have some water.

271
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,000
- I'll carry it.
- Hurry.

272
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,020
Here.

273
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,140
Hurry, hurry.

274
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,620
- Hurry and carry it.
- Sure.

275
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,660
Give me more.

276
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,620
I can carry more.

277
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,260
Lift the chest now.

278
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,420
Try harder.

279
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,720
I'll help you.

280
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,980
Alright, enough.

281
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,300
Enough.

282
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,340
You can stay here one more day.

283
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,180
I'll move back tomorrow.

284
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,700
Thank you, My Lord.

285
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,100
Water. Give me some water.

286
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,460
(Government Office)

287
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,300
My Lord,

288
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,580
it's now the time
for heading and grain fill.

289
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,420
(Government Hall, Wei State)
But across Wei State,

290
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,980
aside from Yujun and Hanjun,

291
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,020
many areas have faced
continuous drought.

292
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,860
It may affect

293
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,660
next year's harvest.

294
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,660
Pass down my decree:

295
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
From today onward,

296
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,140
local affairs

297
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,940
must prioritize irrigation water.

298
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,600
Military needs come second.

299
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
Yes.

300
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,100
That's not appropriate.

301
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,580
Military supplies

302
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,420
and warhorses

303
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,780
consume a great deal of water.

304
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,780
Besides, we've just reclaimed
Xindu and Panyi.

305
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,260
Our army's morale is high.

306
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,700
We should press forward now.

307
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,700
Shao,

308
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm speaking to you.

309
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
Uncle, you may not know.

310
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,900
After years of war,

311
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,160
both the people and soldiers
are utterly exhausted.

312
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,140
The reason

313
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,260
I allied with Yanzhou

314
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,820
was to buy time

315
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,340
to recover and rebuild

316
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,820
and wait for the right moment.

317
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,820
So, in the short term,

318
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,700
I won't take the initiative to attack

319
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,540
unless we're invaded.

320
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,060
Your weariness of war is understandable.

321
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,620
Since that's the case,

322
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,580
this might be a good opportunity

323
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,340
to consider the matter of an heir.

324
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,500
You see.

325
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,340
Lady Qiao is still in mourning.

326
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,740
She can't bear children for you.

327
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
In that case,

328
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,740
why not take a concubine sooner?

329
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,300
The Lord's wedding was
less than three months ago.

330
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,820
To take a concubine now

331
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,100
would not be proper.

332
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,660
Why wouldn't it be proper?

333
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,940
What difference is there
between three days and three months?

334
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
My Lord,

335
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,380
if you want to refuse,

336
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,500
I won't say more.

337
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,060
But if you delay it three months today,

338
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,740
you'll delay it

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,100
three years tomorrow.

340
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,860
Shao,

341
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,100
as the saying goes,

342
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,820
Hanjun is known for its women,

343
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,080
and Yujun is known for its men.

344
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,740
I have a foster daughter

345
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,140
at the right age

346
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,220
who can help continue

347
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,380
your bloodline.

348
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,220
With an heir,

349
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,780
we'll all be at ease.

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,020
So, you're implying

351
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,860
that without an heir,

352
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,380
you won't be at ease?

353
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,340
I'm thinking only
for the greater good of the state.

354
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,700
If you have someone you love,

355
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,300
I'll say no more.

356
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,540
But your marriage with Lady Qiao

357
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,620
was for political gain.

358
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
There's no love.

359
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,980
The hope of an heir is slim,

360
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,020
so I want you to take a concubine sooner

361
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,500
to solidify the family line.

362
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,740
My Lord,

363
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,580
please believe me.

364
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,620
My Lord,

365
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,820
taking a concubine is serious.

366
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,190
You should hold a public selection
across all cities,

367
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,060
not just from Hanjun.

368
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,240
Yes.

369
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,580
We can help choose
the most suitable ones for you.

370
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,380
Who says

371
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,740
there's no love between me

372
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,060
and Lady Qiao?

373
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,980
I admit

374
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,660
I married her for Panyi.

375
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,540
But after spending time with her,

376
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,140
I saw that she's not only beautiful

377
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,380
but concerned for the people.

378
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,260
She has the talent and bearing

379
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,300
worthy of my wife.

380
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,580
Besides, when we married,

381
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,700
she swore to be only a Wei

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,180
instead of a Qiao.

383
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,700
Qiao Gui just died,

384
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,820
yet she insisted on marrying me.

385
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,700
That's a betrayal of her own family.

386
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,580
Now, the two of us

387
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,340
are deeply in love.

388
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,460
We're truly a loving couple.

389
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,620
So, Uncle,

390
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,220
there's no room by my side

391
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,260
for any other concubine.

392
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,980
I heard the Lady's been unwell,

393
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,860
and the Lord even gave up
the main chamber

394
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,140
so she could rest.

395
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,300
He moved to the side chamber.

396
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,420
The Lord treats the Lady

397
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,700
with utmost care

398
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,260
and affection.

399
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,580
It's known throughout the mansion.

400
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,450
- It is.
- Yes.

401
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,300
- Truly.
- Yes.

402
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,140
Exactly.

403
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,460
That may not be true.

404
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,140
Mr. Gongsun, I almost forgot.

405
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,020
Tan.

406
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,680
Yes.

407
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,740
I told you to place
my favorite daily necessities

408
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,100
where they belong.

409
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
Did you do it?

410
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,500
Everything's been arranged
just as you like.

411
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,700
However,

412
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,420
the side chamber is small,

413
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,980
so we haven't found

414
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,260
a proper spot

415
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,700
to hang your favorite bow.

416
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,620
The Lord truly cherishes the Lady.

417
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,260
He's even willing

418
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,500
to move into the side chamber.

419
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,780
Their love

420
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,820
is indeed genuine.

421
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,980
Of course.

422
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,540
Well.

423
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,540
Thank you, Uncle,

424
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,140
but I'll have to decline

425
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,180
your kind offer.

426
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,680
General Wei, thank you for your concern.

427
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
General Wei is very thoughtful.

428
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,500
We appreciate your good intentions.

429
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,340
These guys...

430
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,940
Everyone, as you can see,

431
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,060
he just doesn't want
anyone I recommend by his side.

432
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,980
Can't you see it?

433
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,140
He's guarding against us.

434
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,540
Why did those servants
suddenly change their attitude?

435
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,620
Could it be that the Lord sent them?

436
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,660
The Lord's been staying
in the side chamber for days

437
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,820
so the Lady can recover.

438
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,220
Sending a dozen maids

439
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,420
to take care of her

440
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,580
is nothing strange, right?

441
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,740
Is he really kind to those around him

442
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,980
just as Nanny Zhong said?

443
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,580
Xiaozao,

444
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,740
go to the side chamber

445
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,980
and tell the Lord I've fully recovered.

446
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,060
Ask him to come back.

447
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,100
Yes.

448
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,900
My Lady.

449
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,980
Tan,

450
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,100
why are you here?

451
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,140
The Lord asked me to fetch bedding

452
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,260
and bring back some clothes.

453
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,780
Just now, the Lady wanted me
to invite him back.

454
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,220
The Lord's been busy with work lately

455
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,200
and often returns late.

456
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,300
He plans to stay in the side chamber
a while longer

457
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,880
and told me to remind the Lady

458
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
to recover in the main chamber.

459
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,060
Everyone in the mansion

460
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,140
knows the Lord rejected

461
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,140
his uncle's offer
about taking a concubine

462
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,100
yesterday at the office.

463
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,180
He said you two
had faced danger together

464
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,720
and he wouldn't take a concubine

465
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,100
to hurt your dignity.

466
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,660
These maids

467
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,100
must've heard that too.

468
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,420
Who'd dare mistreat you now?

469
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Since arriving in Panyi,

470
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,420
you two

471
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,580
have finally grown some affection.

472
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,940
In this family,

473
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,260
if the Lord continues to protect you,

474
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,660
you won't suffer too much.

475
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,740
Between husband and wife,

476
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,460
love is what matters most.

477
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,180
Uncle once said

478
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,420
he'd never take a concubine
because of Aunt.

479
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,260
But I don't think

480
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,580
that alone means love.

481
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,580
Regarding these things,

482
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,980
people often follow the crowd.

483
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,260
I can't just believe it

484
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,500
because everyone says so.

485
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,700
Exactly.

486
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,340
If you want a loving life,

487
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,820
you can't rely solely
on the Lord's efforts.

488
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,020
Where's Xiaotao?

489
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,300
That child.

490
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,980
Ever since we arrived in Yujun,

491
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,820
she's been using your dowry

492
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,900
to start a business.

493
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,340
She said she wanted you

494
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,420
to live comfortably

495
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,500
for the rest of your life.

496
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,620
Sir,

497
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,200
how much is it

498
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,540
for this golden forehead jewelry?

499
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,420
500 coppers.

500
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,900
How about this jade-inlaid hairpin?

501
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,260
That one's 800.

502
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,420
May I take a look?

503
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,260
Of course.

504
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,620
Here.

505
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,300
Sir,

506
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,100
in business,

507
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,260
comparing goods is a real risk.

508
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,460
Miss, what do you mean?

509
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,300
Your items are fine,

510
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,900
but they're not good enough.

511
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,940
This one is different.

512
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,540
It's the latest style
from Kangjun in Yanzhou.

513
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,220
I had someone buy it with 1,500 coppers.

514
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,900
It's already sold out.

515
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,820
If you take it to a pawnshop,

516
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,100
it could fetch 2,000 coppers.

517
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
It's just that I need money at home now.

518
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,700
How about

519
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,420
you sell it for me on consignment?

520
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,180
The item's fine quality,

521
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,260
but 2,000 coppers

522
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,660
might be too expensive.

523
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,700
Well, if you can sell it at that price,

524
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,220
I only want 1,200.

525
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,700
You keep the other 800.

526
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,140
I can earn without putting in labor

527
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:41,780
or materials?

528
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,300
Isn't that a perfect deal?

529
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,820
How's it going with the selection

530
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,020
of elite troops?

531
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,260
My Lord, these days,

532
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,620
I've been training troops

533
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,780
with a few other generals.

534
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,020
Though we call it training,

535
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,100
it's actually a tryout.

536
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,340
We've reached a consensus.

537
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,380
3,000 elite troops can be

538
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,420
directly transferred
from General Wei Qu's command.

539
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,940
Indeed, the men under Wei Qu

540
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,100
are seasoned and elite.

541
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,160
(Outside Yujun, Wei State)
But most of them are cavalry.

542
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,020
Aside from those 3,000,

543
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,220
pick 1,000 swimmers

544
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,340
to come along.

545
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,540
(Chijun, Liangya State)

546
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,100
(Mansion of Liangya's Heir,
Liangya State)

547
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,180
If we'd known Xiaoqiao's dowry

548
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,940
was truly Panyi,

549
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,220
you should've treated her better,

550
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,660
and Wei State

551
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,900
wouldn't have gotten such a good deal.

552
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,300
They've even

553
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,460
stationed troops in Panyi.

554
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,860
It'll be hard for us

555
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,380
to reclaim it now.

556
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,260
Wei State wants to strike first.

557
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,180
Uncle, why not report to Father

558
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,460
and increase troops at Xiaogang

559
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,340
to pressure Panyi?

560
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,780
You're right.

561
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,380
You are right.

562
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,700
I'll go at once.

563
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,780
My Lady,

564
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,980
a letter from Yanzhou.

565
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,460
Read it to me.

566
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,860
Follow your husband after marriage.

567
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,900
Uphold virtue and duty.

568
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,210
Be loving and loyal.

569
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,380
Bear children.

570
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,780
Do not disgrace the family.

571
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,700
Is this a family letter?

572
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,900
(Qiao Yue)
It's clearly the Instructions for Women.

573
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,020
My Lady, you're having
such a hard time here,

574
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,260
yet the Governor
still pins his hopes on you

575
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,220
to resolve the conflict
between the two clans.

576
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,940
Uncle is worried for Yanzhou,

577
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,020
hoping I can use my gentleness

578
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,420
and beauty to persuade the Lord

579
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,220
to benefit Yanzhou

580
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,020
and not target them.

581
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,660
But in this world,

582
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,180
when is anything ever that easy?

583
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,980
My Lord,

584
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,740
last year's harvest was insufficient.

585
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,780
There may be another famine next year.

586
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,460
Only Hanjun still has a surplus.

587
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,500
If you ask me,

588
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,580
you should take his foster daughter
as a concubine.

589
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,820
- Yes.
- Besides,

590
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,500
Lady Qiao can't stay as your wife.

591
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
A Qiao

592
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,420
can never truly be

593
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,860
the Lady of Wei.

594
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Lady Qiao is unworthy.

595
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,640
Wei Dian's foster daughter
can't be accepted.

596
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,380
- My wife has...
- Enough.

597
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,540
My marriage with her

598
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,540
is both personal and political.

599
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,980
I've let your words
at the ancestral hall slide.

600
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,420
But this is the study.

601
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,740
You are my subjects.

602
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,460
How dare you speak ill
of the Lady in front of me?

603
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,940
Yes, My Lord.

604
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,140
As I've married her,

605
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,220
she is the Lady of Wei.

606
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,780
You only see that she's a Qiao,

607
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,940
but you've never witnessed
her poise and courage.

608
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Do not talk

609
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,780
about taking concubines anymore.

610
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,860
Yes, My Lord.

611
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,900
It's quite sweet.

612
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,900
I was talking about this red bean soup.

613
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,460
Let's go.

614
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,180
My Lady.

615
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,600
The Lady was worried
the Lord might be tired,

616
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,700
so she brought soup.

617
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,580
What was that? Louder.

618
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,420
The Lady was worried
the Lord might be tired,

619
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,460
so she brought soup.

620
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,580
She's waiting just outside.

621
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,220
Newlyweds care for each other.

622
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,260
How loving.

623
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,580
Indeed.

624
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,060
That's right.

625
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,940
It's so cold now.

626
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,140
She's caught a chill

627
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,200
yet still came personally.

628
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,020
Let her in.

629
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
My Lord, you ordered before

630
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,580
that no women

631
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,940
are allowed in the study.

632
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,060
If I fail to enforce this,

633
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,580
my yearly pay will be docked.

634
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,140
The Lady is an exception.

635
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,780
Yes.

636
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,940
Wait.

637
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,660
Forget it. I'll go bring her in.

638
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
The Lord often handles

639
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,140
state matters here in the study.

640
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,420
He must really

641
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,700
trust the Lady.

642
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Is Lady Qiao

643
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,380
really so remarkable?

644
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,460
The Lady is here.

645
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,500
These are all family elders.

646
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,180

My Lady.

650
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,300
It's cold today,
yet you're dressed so lightly.

651
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,340
Tan, bring the cloak.

652
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,180

687
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,300
and even packed everything up.

688
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,260
But the Lord felt sorry for the Lady

689
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,500
and insisted we stay here.

690
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,860
My Lady.

691
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,220
Your cheeks

692
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,060
are red like fruit.

693
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,100
Have you caught a chill?

694
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm fine.

695
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,420
However,

696
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,700
my heart's been fluttery lately

697
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,020
for no reason.

698
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,780
Sure.

699
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,980
The Lord carried you all the way back,

700
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,540
and you bumped into many people.

701
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,300
Who wouldn't feel flustered?

702
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,020
But

703
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,900
that day was worse.

704
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
That day?

705
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,460
The day we entered the city.

706
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,620
You had a high fever,

707
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,260
and the Lord carried you back
the same way.

708
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,180
He's gotten used to carrying you,

709
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,860
but now you're getting embarrassed.

710
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
I misunderstood him back then.

711
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,860
Leaving me outside the city

712
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,180
wasn't his intention.

713
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,460
Yet I blamed him

714
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,460
and made him stay
in the side chamber for days.

715
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,980
Has the Lady fallen asleep?

716
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,380
Tan?

717
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,140
Why is he here

718
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,220
so late?

719
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,420
Coming.

720
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,500
My Lady.

721
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,700
What's this?

722
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,380
The Lord asked me to bring this.

723
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,340
He said your clothes
got soaked in the rain

724
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,300
outside the city.

725
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,480
These are for making new ones.

726
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,020
He also said

727
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,700
you're still in mourning,

728
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,020
so light-colored fabric is best.

729
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,020
The Lord is very thoughtful.

730
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,300
(Wei Mansion)

731
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,820
She's finally here.

732
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,260
Is she planning to move in now?

733
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,820
The Lord stays in the side chamber,

734
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,660
while she takes over the main chamber.

735
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,980
As a new bride,

736
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,260
where are her manners?

737
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,350
It's still early.

738
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,300
Why are you here?

739
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
It's cold.

740
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,900
I brought your cloak.

741
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,380
I don't need your care.

742
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,140
Just take care of yourself.

743
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,700
Is this the room prepared for the Lady?

744
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,980
This is too plain.

745
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,700
I didn't expect

746
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,380
the Lord to treat her so well.

747
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,300
Who knows what tricks she's used?

748
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Can you hear us there?

749
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,140
Come in and let's chat.

750
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,660
You're leaving?

751
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,300
Back at your parents' house,

752
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,580
they know you'll marry off
sooner or later,

753
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,300
so they treat you like an outsider.

754
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,300
After you marry,

755
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,640
your husband's family
also treats you like an outsider

756
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,700
because you join them halfway.

757
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,140
It's hard

758
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,580
being a woman.

759
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,220
But you're lucky.

760
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,300
The Lord cherishes you.

761
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,100
It's not all hardship.

762
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,020
The Lord sees me as his wife
and treats me well.

763
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,940
I should make sure
everything else is in order.

764
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,180
Clean up this room,

765
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,740
so it's more comfortable for him.

766
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,700
Wait.

767
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,140
Since they see me as an outsider,

768
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,540
then things like preparing his room

769
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,740
should be handled by themselves.

770
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,260
Call them over.

771
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,140
Yes.

772
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,700
Xiaotao,

773
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,060
go and make some inquiries.

774
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,900
Sure.

775
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,140
Duang.

776
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,940
What do you want?

777
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,500
I have a few questions.

778
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,940
The Advisor said

779
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,420
no questions about military affairs,

780
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,740
no questions about state affairs,

781
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,020
and no questions about the Lord.

782
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,860
Sure.

783
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,220
I'm not asking about the Lord.

784
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,340
I'm asking about you.

785
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,420
Me?

786
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,260
What about me?

787
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,260
I care about you.

788
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,940
Then go ahead.

789
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,140
Let me ask you.

790
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,020
How do you normally get along
with the Lord?

791
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,580
We eat and sleep together.

792
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,940
What do you usually do?

793
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,100
We're always training.

794
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,220
That's good.

795
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,500
After training,

796
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,540
what do you eat?

797
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Lots of stuff.

798
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,260
Beef.

799
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,140
Lamb.

800
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,980
And...

801
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,580
Why am I telling you this?

802
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,020
I've got serious work to do.

803
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,220
I'm not done, Duang.

804
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,380
What are you doing?

805
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,920
Have you lost your soul
after this morning?

806
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,100
No.

807
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,740
I have some questions.

808
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,580
Well.

809
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,700
If a woman

810
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,540
keeps asking you questions

811
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,540
all about daily, trivial stuff,

812
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,500
what is she up to?

813
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,820
She's spying on military affairs.

814
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,900
She wants your salary.

815
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,820
Nonsense.

816
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,300
You deal with women all the time.

817
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,420
What do you think?

818
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,740
Do you really want to know?

819
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,780
I'm meeting the guys tonight
at Luozhong Tavern.

820
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,980
What about my wine bill?

821
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,580
Fine, I'll cover it.

822
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,440
Look.

823
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,900
I knew this would cost you.

824
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,220
Listen.

825
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,540
In this big world,

826
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,980
if a man

827
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,300
or a woman suddenly

828
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,980
takes an interest
in someone's everyday life,

829
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,420
even their food and daily schedule,

830
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,060
there's no doubt

831
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,820
that he or she has fallen for them.

832
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,780
No way.

833
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,900
Absolutely not.

834
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,420
My Lady,

835
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
I asked Wei Liang in detail.

836
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,400
The Lord eats and lives with them.

837
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,700
So, whatever Wei Liang often eats

838
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,420
(Apricots, sliced liver, red bean soup)
must be what the Lord likes.

839
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,380
Then prepare these.

840
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,220
Got it.

841
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,300
Tan.

842
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,580
Yes?

843
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,620
Who arranged all this?

844
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,380
It was the Lady.

845
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,680
She started preparing everything

846
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,040
right after you left this morning.

847
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,140
Then go tell her.

848
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,380
She's been in Yujun for a while.

849
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,900
Tomorrow,

850
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,680
I'll take her to visit Grandmother.

851
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,500
Yes.

852
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,700
How is it?

853
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,300
It's wonderful.

854
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,860
You're beautiful.

855
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,700
Lady Xu will surely be pleased.

856
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
You've always been poised
since you came of age.

857
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,640
It's been a long time
since I've seen you so nervous.

858
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,920
When I first came to Yujun,

859
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
because of the relationship
between our families,

860
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,540
I hadn't met the elders yet.

861
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,340
Now, the Lord is personally taking me.

862
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,980
I should be thorough and careful

863
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,700
so as not to waste his kindness.

864
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,380
Let's go.

865
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,660
My Lord.

866
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,340
Can't you walk slower?

867
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,460
I'm dressed formally

868
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,260
to meet the elders today.

869
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,460
The train is short.

870
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,340
You're already taller than me

871
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,380
with longer legs.

872
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,800
If you keep walking like this,
I won't be able to keep up.

873
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,500
How troublesome.

874
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,460
Are we talking in a secret language?

875
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,680
I'm saying you should go first
as your legs are short.

876
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,860
If you've gone
for an incense stick of time,

877
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,100
I can still catch up with you.

878
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,020
Hurry up.
