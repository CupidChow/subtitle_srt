The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If it weren't for your treachery,

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
my father and brother wouldn't have died in the battlefield.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My mother

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
wouldn't have died in grief.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I...

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
wouldn't have become a wild child

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
who fights with wolves.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So,

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
look at me.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I deserve to die.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Master.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She saved Xin Du.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Master ordered to catch the court lady

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and kill her.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Search carefully.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Catch the court lady and kill her.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Search carefully.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Catch the court lady and kill her.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xin Du.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Xin Du.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come here.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll protect you.

33
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Xin Du.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I went to the Qiao family to avoid the disaster when I was 13.

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I returned to Liangya when I was 18.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The five years I spent in the Qiao family

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
were the happiest time of my life.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My heart for you

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
is as clear as the sun and the moon.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I know

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that you're worried about me.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't be afraid.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've made up my mind.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As long as you come with me,

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can pretend that nothing happened.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Master,

47
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
don't you want to say something?

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come here.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You'd better not say it.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Man Man.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Man Man.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see you as a treasure.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you're a dragon.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Say it.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Shoot.

56
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Shoot.

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Shoot.

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Kill.

59
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The only regret is the death of my wife.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll report it later.

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Go.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Go.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't be afraid.

64
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Man Man.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a traitor.

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll beat you.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Kill.

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kill.

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Does it hurt?

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here?

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're so arrogant.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You broke our legs

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
on the battlefield.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You showed your bones.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You kept fighting

77
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
with your arms around your legs.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why are you crying?

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's all my fault.

81
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm a noble woman.

82
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I should have been as powerful

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
as the soldiers in the Marquis of Wei.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I broke my bones,

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
re-suggested,

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and studied the iron and steel.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I don't deserve to be with you.

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You don't have to be so weird.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not because of these wounds.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
My wounds

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are nothing compared to the lives of the people.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What do you mean?

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I didn't expect that

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
after the separation of the trust,

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
we could meet again.

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If I were to be killed

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
by the soldiers in the Marquis of Wei,

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wouldn't have heard

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
your sweet words.

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I stopped her.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There are still those flags

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in the sand.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's not bad to kill.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You don't even have any evidence.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You just let me and Liu Yan

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
split up.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I even helped you burn the embers.

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I even helped you to attack the city.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's all your fault.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're the one who

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
has to interfere in the family affairs.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You almost died here.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My life

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
is not as important as the lives of the people.

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My family is supposed to

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
care for the people and soldiers.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I won't let anyone die.

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's the same now.

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was the same 14 years ago.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You...

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not involved in the family affairs.

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's all my fault.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't be the one to do things.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why I was taken away

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
by someone at the city gate.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm not a good person.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I've ruined your reputation.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I have to let you take care of me.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Enough.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Stop acting pitiful.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Come on. Let's go back.

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How can I change...

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Cut the crap. Come up.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't move.

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The current Marquis Wei

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and the new Marquis of the Zhuwu City

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
are just two different people.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll also tell you some personal words.

139
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
To be honest,

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've been thinking about you.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I've been thinking about you.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're my wife.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm your wife as well.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know you're my wife.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I know you're my wife.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm your wife as well.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm your wife as well.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm your wife as well.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm your wife as well.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm your wife as well.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm your wife as well.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll tell you some personal words.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't want to marry the current Marquis of the Zhuwu City.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Liu Yan

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
saw me

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because I was of low price.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He knew I'm being criticized

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and he wants to marry me.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But you

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
have a crush on me

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,700
after you had my

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
dress.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's the difference between you and her?

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
For girls in the world,

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
marriage is a big deal.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you forcing me?

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Am I not worth it?

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
Come here.

169
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,880
You're right.

170
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
iedzimu

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Dear flashlight

172
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,080
аетimu

173
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,200
First person

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,960
No one

175
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,360
Z projector

176
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,080
X-File

177
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,600
X-File

178
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Harris

179
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,000
X-File

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,760
sitter

181
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,360
I hope someone can be myself

182
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,200
Are you OK?

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,160
of I

184
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,920
I think so

185
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,840
Yelong

186
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,280
You don't want to marry Wei Shao?

187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,840
Of course I do.

188
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,080
I just need him to take the initiative.

189
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,200
Now,

190
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Pan Yucheng is already taken over by him.

191
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,240
Is there any way to get him back?

192
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,040
I know that the military is good for the heart.

193
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,560
I want him to marry me willingly.

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
You're so stubborn.

195
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,080
When the Marquis sent you back,

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
you were so nervous.

197
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,360
An Tadao

198
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,240
Tadao

199
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,760
Anwość

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,120
Zhongying has performed some dance for you.

201
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,560
Should I say another dance?

202
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
The most desirable,

203
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,280
If she asks for help from you,

204
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,280
you must take it seriously.

205
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,280
The most important thing is...

206
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Yes.

207
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Why?

208
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Why?

209
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
It's my fault.

210
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
You don't love me.

211
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
I don't deserve you.

212
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Father.

213
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Father.

214
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Father.

215
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Father.

216
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Father.

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Execute the ritual.

218
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Execute the ritual.

219
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
God bless you.

220
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
God bless you.

221
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
God bless you.

222
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Brother.

223
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,280
If I can be loved by the people like my father,

224
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
that's enough.

225
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
God bless you.

226
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Listen, everyone.

227
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,280
We have been ordered by the Lord

228
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
to collect the money from the city of Pan Yi

229
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
to repair the city's construction.

230
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Each person pays a day's salary.

231
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,280
If you have any problem, please go there to sign.

232
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm hungry.

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Sir.

234
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Do you have any children?

235
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Do you have any children?

236
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
What did you say?

237
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Do you have any children?

238
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Old man.

239
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
It's almost done.

240
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
It's done.

241
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I told you not to move.

242
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
You didn't listen.

243
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
You scared me.

244
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,280
This scene is familiar.

245
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
It's a pity that the city of Pan Yi

246
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
doesn't have the second city wall

247
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
to be pushed by the Lord.

248
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Stop talking nonsense.

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Who goes to put food and who goes to collect the people?

250
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You go first.

251
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
I go first.

252
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Come on.

253
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
I...

254
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Go.

255
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Hard work is not easy.

256
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
It's a first time and a second time.

257
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Go.

258
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Go.

259
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Why did you beat me?

260
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
The people of Pan Yi know that

261
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Mr. Qiao has given Pan Yi to the girl as a dowry.

262
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Marquis Wei has a good intention.

263
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
That's the trust of the girl.

264
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
It's natural for the people of Pan Yi

265
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
to do something for the city's Lord.

266
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,280
But I don't know what's wrong.

267
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Lord Liu brought the girl here

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
and said he would get married here.

269
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
But the girl only needs to

270
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,280
come forward and announce the engagement.

271
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Just one word.

272
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Marquis Wei, you take the seal

273
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
and take over the seal.

274
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
It's a fair and just deal.

275
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Your county magistrate is interesting.

276
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
You really support the people

277
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,280
who support each other.

278
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
You people of Yan

279
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
are not honest.

280
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
You are wronged, Marquis Wei.

281
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm sincere to you.

282
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,280
You should go back first.

283
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I'll leave first.

284
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Although Yang Feng is a fool,

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,280
what he said is reasonable.

286
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I don't believe it.

287
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I can't do it without him.

288
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,280
He is a weak girl.

289
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Why do you care?

290
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
What about the seal?

291
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Don't you go to see her?

292
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Me? Me?

293
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
I won't go.

294
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Little girl.

295
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
What?

296
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
My master asked me to

297
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
send some ointment to your wife.

298
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
And ask her to go to the Lord.

299
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Here.

300
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
No.

301
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
My master has something important

302
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
to discuss with your wife?

303
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
What?

304
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
It's the time of the day.

305
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
She fell asleep.

306
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
After all, my wife

307
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
saved the people of Wei

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
to prevent the rumors.

309
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
She hurt her wrist.

310
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
The water

311
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
was used to clean the wound.

312
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
What?

313
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
General Wei Dun,

314
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
are you going to disturb him?

315
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
No.

316
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll ask Wei Dun to feed me.

317
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
My name is Wei Liang.

318
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
We are brothers.

319
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Wei Liang, Wei Qu, Wei Xiao, Wei...

320
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Whatever you like.

321
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Fine.

322
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
You're a girl.

323
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
Why do you care?

324
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
I'll come tomorrow at noon.

325
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Please let me know.

326
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
We have a guest.

327
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Is it a guest or a question?

328
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
This is like a rumor.

329
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Leave.

330
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Yes.

331
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Now you can invite the bridegroom.

332
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
The bridegroom fell asleep.

333
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
It's only half past five.

334
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
The bridegroom fell asleep without eating.

335
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
The bridegroom has a sore wound.

336
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
He can't eat without a appetite.

337
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
He fell asleep early.

338
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Please come early tomorrow.

339
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
I'll go.

340
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Miss Tao.

341
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I've picked some fresh goods for you.

342
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
You and Zao,

343
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Chunniang

344
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
and your bridegroom.

345
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Please tell them

346
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
to come out and say something.

347
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Tao.

348
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Take the goods and leave.

349
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Where's the bridegroom?

350
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
The bridegroom fell asleep.

351
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Since you know it,

352
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
I won't keep it.

353
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Why today?

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
The bridegroom had a sore wound last night.

355
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
He had two more bowls of rice for a relief.

356
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
He ate chicken for a while and fell asleep at dawn.

357
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
You said he had no appetite last night.

358
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
He ate chicken for a whole night?

359
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Then allow your marquis to drive him away

360
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
and invite him back.

361
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
When he comes back,

362
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
he can't eat without a appetite.

363
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
I think he's

364
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
really sick.

365
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Sick?

366
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Master, you still call him sick?

367
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Master, you mean

368
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
he'll be fine after a meal.

369
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
You should have said so earlier.

370
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Master.

371
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Please.

372
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
He's a weak girl.

373
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
A weak girl.

374
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
She was driven out of the capital by Master.

375
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
She was threatened by rumors.

376
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Now she's injured by the people.

377
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
It's inevitable

378
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
to feel wronged.

379
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
But think about it.

380
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
If Master apologizes,

381
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
it'll be solved, right?

382
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Right?

383
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Why should I apologize?

384
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Right.

385
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,280
These are just

386
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
their little tricks.

387
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Get the stick.

388
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Master.

389
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
What are you going to do?

390
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
I'll get it out of the room.

391
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Go.

392
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Go.

393
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
You're acting tough to a woman.

394
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I wonder if it'll work on your marquis.

395
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Can you make him

396
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
agree to marry you if you pretend to be sick?

397
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
You're still thinking about me?

398
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
How dare you!

399
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
How dare you!

400
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
You even want people to spy on us.

401
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Yulang, come on.

402
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Lie down.

403
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Lie down.

404
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Lie down.

405
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Close your eyes.

406
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Close your eyes.

407
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Are you feeling better, Yulang?

408
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Yulang.

409
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Someone just left this at the door.

410
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
What's this?

411
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
It's Zhang Jian's stuff.

412
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Master.

413
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Yulang, let's go.

414
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Let's get out of the back door.

415
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
He's really pretending to be sick.

416
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
What is he doing

417
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
in this place?

418
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Man Man.

419
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Man Man.

420
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Zhang Jian.

421
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I never thought

422
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
you'd help me

423
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
to solve the problem of running away from marriage.

424
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
You just don't want me to suffer

425
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and to be in danger.

426
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Since you've already known my feelings,

427
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
why do you still insist on coming here?

428
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
You've always

429
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
been trying to help me.

430
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,280
Since the Wei family is a family of tigers and wolves,

431
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I can't let you get hurt.

432
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Let me take you here

433
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
to receive you.

434
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Let's run away together.

435
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Zhang Jian.

436
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
If I insist on marrying the Duke Wei,

437
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
can you help me?

438
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
That Wei Shao

439
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
is very vicious.

440
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
He can punish Li Su Chu severely.

441
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
If he can't,

442
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
where can he take you?

443
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
You're so haggard.

444
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm haggard because Liu Yan

445
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
took advantage of me.

446
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
It has nothing to do with Wei Shao.

447
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
He's much better than Liu Yan.

448
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
He and our family are enemies.

449
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
How can he get you to be so careful?

450
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Zhang Jian only knows

451
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
that he killed Li Su.

452
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
He doesn't know

453
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
that he saved hundreds of thousands of people.

454
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
And

455
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
he

456
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,760
is very

457
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
affectionate.

458
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Look at your mouth.

459
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
It's really more affectionate

460
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
than a soldier's body.

461
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
When did you become so affectionate?

462
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
But, Wan Wan,

463
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
are you...

464
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Are you sincere?

465
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Isn't it to help me and Bi Zhi?

466
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Who will help you and Bi Zhi?

467
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
I'm begging you.

468
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
Just help me and Wei Shao.

469
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
If so,

470
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I'll do whatever I want

471
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
to do with Bi Zhi.

472
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Eat.

473
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
You have to be good to Bi Zhi.

474
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Wan Wan.

475
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
It's getting late.

476
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
How about this?

477
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
I'll ask them to find a place

478
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
to settle down for you.

479
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
I'll go to the hospital.

480
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
I'll go to the hospital.

481
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I'll go to the hospital.

482
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I'll go to the hospital.

483
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
The daughter of Qiao Yue

484
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
has left the hometown.

485
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
I didn't expect

486
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
that her family would be separated.

487
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I'll go to catch her now.

488
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Come back.

489
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
What does Master mean?

490
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Will he be

491
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
fascinated by Shuang Qiao's beauty?

492
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Or

493
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
he'll be blinded by her beauty.

494
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
So, the woman was married

495
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
to a nun.

496
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
She's a very strange person.

497
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
What does she think?

498
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
How's the plan going?

499
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Don't worry.

500
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I've placed them

501
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
in the B2 Wooden Pavilion.

502
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
That's good.

503
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Yilang,

504
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
Marquis Weihong is here.

505
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
He said he wanted to see you.

506
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Did he find out about us?

507
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Don't panic.

508
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I'll tell him for you.

509
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
What did Marquis Weihong

510
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
want to see me about?

511
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I heard you're sick.

512
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
Marquis Weihong

513
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
cares about my health so much today.

514
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Is there anything

515
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
you want to discuss?

516
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Nothing else.

517
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm just afraid that the people

518
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
won't see you for a long time

519
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
and beg me.

520
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
You're so straightforward today.

521
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I also care about the people.

522
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
But my body really drags me down.

523
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
It's cold outside the capital.

524
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
My hands are hurt.

525
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
It's been good.

526
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
I feel like

527
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I can't keep up with my physical strength.

528
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
How about waiting a few more days?

529
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
A few days ago,

530
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
I drove you out of the capital.

531
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
It's my fault.

532
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I shouldn't have added

533
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
the hatred of the Qiao family to you.

534
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
But now,

535
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
you're fighting against the rumors

536
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
for the sake of the people

537
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
and hurting yourself.

538
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
I should

539
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
thank you on behalf of the people.

540
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Marquis Weihong

541
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
doesn't have to feel wronged.

542
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
He's just like me.

543
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
He's rich and capable.

544
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
I have many prejudices against the Qiao family.

545
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
But today,

546
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I think you're different

547
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
from the other family members.

548
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
You're not blaming me

549
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
for yourself.

550
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
You're blaming the people

551
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
and Zhang Jian.

552
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm Zhang Jian.

553
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
I...

554
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Since you're not in good health,

555
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
try to go to places

556
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
like the back hill.

557
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
It's windy and easy to get sick.

558
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Even if you have to see your loved ones,

559
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
you should be careful.

560
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
You know I met Zhang Jian?

561
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
How's your belt?

562
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
I won't

563
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
argue with a woman.

564
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Thank you, Marquis Weihong.

565
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Remember to take your medicine.

566
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Let's go.

567
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Come on,

568
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
everyone.

569
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Make way, make way.

570
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Come on.

571
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Stand in front.

572
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
We have something to tell you.

573
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Please be quiet.

574
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Please be quiet.

575
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
Yulang, please.

576
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Everyone,

577
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
you know that

578
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
one hundred and forty years ago,

579
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
My grandfather made a promise to the old Marquis

580
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,560
to make the three generations of the Wei family's ancestors

581
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,640
die in battle.

582
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,560
The capital was also slaughtered at a high rate.

583
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
The people used their relatives' relics

584
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,440
to bully the people and remember their hatred.

585
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
But 14 years later,

586
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,120
the Marquis took back the capital again

587
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,800
and ordered people to push the people's wall.

588
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,560
Why?

589
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,240
Yes.

590
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,880
Yes.

591
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Why?

592
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Because

593
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
the Marquis is generous and generous.

594
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
He cares about the people.

595
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,360
The Marquis took back the capital again

596
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
not just for revenge,

597
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
but for a deeper purpose.

598
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Yes.

599
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,280
Yes.

600
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,000
My grandfather and the old Marquis were good friends.

601
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,800
They built the Yongning Pavilion together.

602
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,680
The farmers were greedy.

603
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,280
But the capital was taken away by the Li family.

604
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,320
The Yongning Pavilion was blocked by the people.

605
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
It was abandoned.

606
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,760
The people suffered a lot.

607
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,720
This time, the Marquis succeeded.

608
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,960
He wanted to rebuild the Pavilion.

609
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
Now Yanzhou and Wei are in alliance.

610
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,720
There is a saying that the river is the bridge of the Yubo River.

611
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,320
From now on,

612
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,840
the Pavilion is the capital of Wei.

613
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,600
All of us are the descendants of the Marquis.

614
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
It's a great idea to rebuild the Pavilion.

615
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,040
I hope the people of Pavilion can help us.

616
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,800
Great.

617
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
We can win.

618
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
We can win.

619
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,200
But you told him that I wanted to rebuild the Pavilion.

620
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,960
I shouldn't have made the decision

621
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,160
to ruin the great cause of the Lord.

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,280
How did he know?

623
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,680
The Marquis

624
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,320
is the successor of the people.

625
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,560
It's a pleasure to have this Lord.

626
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,200
May we work together with the Marquis

627
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,560
to make our wish come true.

628
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,680
May we work together with the Marquis

629
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,520
to make our wish come true.

630
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,200
The Marquis is so arrogant.

631
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,000
He doesn't talk about conditions.

632
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,880
He just wants to send a letter.

633
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,280
And he...

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,360
May we work together with the Marquis

635
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,840
to make our wish come true.

636
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,720
May we work together with the Marquis

637
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,920
to make our wish come true.

638
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,600
May we work together with the Marquis.

639
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,560
What do you think of me?

640
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
People say that the Marquis is busy with the construction.

641
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,480
But when I was in the capital,

642
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,640
I read the letter from the Marquis

643
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,480
to my brother, Pan Yishan.

644
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,400
I found that there are several times

645
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,920
that the word Yongning Qu is used.

646
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,720
Then I went over the map of Wei State.

647
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,360
I found that the Marquis

648
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
did most of the work of the Tongqu in recent years.

649
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,720
I admire him.

650
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to persuade my uncle

651
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,280
to help Lord with the construction of Yanzhou.

652
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,680
You want to use the Tongqu

653
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,760
to talk about conditions?

654
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,400
How dare I?

655
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
This engagement

656
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
is not the promise of Wei State to Yanzhou.

657
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,160
It's the promise of the Marquis

658
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,760
to the people of Wei State and Yanzhou.

659
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,400
Do you know why the Marquis

660
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,480
attacked Xindu 14 years ago?

661
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,280
It's because my grandfather

662
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
helped Wei State to build Yongning Qu.

663
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,920
This map is a secret key.

664
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,480
I wrote a copy for you

665
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,240
so that others won't see it.

666
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
When Yongning Qu is made,

667
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
Yanzhou and Wei State

668
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,160
are like signing a life-and-death treaty.

669
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
Yanzhou can't stop it.

670
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,440
He can only cut the bloodline

671
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
and cut the waist.

672
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
And Pan Yi

673
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,800
is the beloved brother of the bloodline.

674
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,880
He is like

675
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,120
a heart.

676
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,520
When I gave you the heart,

677
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,960
I didn't know these principles.

678
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I just gave you my heart

679
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,520
with guilt and sincerity.

680
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
What do you mean?

681
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,560
The heart is with me anyway.

682
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,800
I've been fighting with it.

683
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
I won't give it back to you.

684
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,920
You took the heart away that day

685
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,440
and kicked me out of Xindu.

686
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,840
I was the only one who failed.

687
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,960
But now I've called on

688
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Pan Yi's people to help you build the Qu.

689
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,240
If you go back on your word,

690
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,720
you'll fail

691
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,640
to the people of Wei State and Yanzhou.

692
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,800
Do you have the heart to do that?

693
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,320
I can't beat you.

694
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,400
But you said

695
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,560
you're not getting married.

696
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,160
Yet I've already given him back the heart.

697
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,280
Have nothing to get angry about.

698
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,040
Only one makes it big.

699
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,840
Qiao Great and VIPلام are both here which build the tree.

700
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,400
There are two left.

701
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
So the one feels uncooperative and the other days mad.

702
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,840
That's the way if.

703
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
I'm afraid.

704
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,240
Who's afraid of the Qiao family?

705
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,440
They're afraid that the Chief will be like last time

706
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
and drive out Qiao Yu.

707
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
That's a good name.

708
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,240
Chief's name is a good name.

709
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,040
Then we'll drive him out.

710
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Like last time,

711
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
we'll drive him out of the capital

712
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,640
and the city.

713
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,640
I just don't know if there's

714
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
any eye-opening

715
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,840
waiting outside the city

716
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
to plan his dowry.

717
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,640
Sir,

718
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,040
what are you going to say?

719
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,640
I dare not

720
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,240
give you the credit.

721
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,640
You decide for yourself.

722
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,040
You don't know

723
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,640
when you'll see me again.

724
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,240
You have to find a place to stay

725
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,840
so that we can write letters.

726
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,840
When I find the place where the An family is,

727
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
I'll tell you.

728
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,640
Okay.

729
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,640
I'll tell you.

730
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,040
I'll tell you.

731
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,440
You've never been through such a hard time.

732
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
If you want to blame,

733
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
blame the fact that

734
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
there's no one who can fight in our family.

735
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
In terms of the mercenaries,

736
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
they're indeed weaker.

737
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Fan, Yu Lang,

738
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,640
there's a dead body in front of us.

739
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
You guys wait for a while.

740
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Let's go.

741
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
I heard

742
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,240
you were driven out of the capital by Marquis Wei.

743
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,840
We also came all the way here.

744
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
On the way here,

745
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,840
we also met Marquis Wei's men.

746
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,440
We fought them.

747
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,640
Later, when we arrived in Hanyi,

748
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
I chased after Lu Yan's men

749
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
and got beaten up.

750
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,640
In a three-way battle,

751
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,840
I entered into the mirror of no one

752
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,240
and came to me.

753
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
He's quite strong.

754
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
It's tiring to drive.

755
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,040
Brother-in-law,

756
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,640
go and find us some food.

757
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,840
This is easy.

758
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,840
Sister Zhang,

759
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,840
I have something to ask you.

760
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,040
This matter concerns the reputation of Yan State.

761
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,840
You must do your best.

762
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
In Yan State, Wei State, and Bian State,

763
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,040
the three regions are interrelated.

764
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,440
Some of them are also famous for their elegance.

765
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,240
Yan State has already given up its heart

766
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,440
for Marquis Wei.

767
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Now Pan Yi is in the hands of Marquis Wei.

768
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,840
When it comes to the first move,

769
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,440
you must keep a back hand

770
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,440
and take over the position of Marquis Yan.

771
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,840
We have been retreating before

772
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,840
because there are no soldiers in our family

773
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,040
and no one can fight.

774
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,640
Now that we have the pen and paper,

775
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,840
I don't believe I can't defend it.

776
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
Man Man asked us to go to Bo Ya.

777
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Then let's go to Bo Ya.

778
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
What is that place?

779
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,840
It's a county.

780
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,240
It's a good place.

781
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,840
It's not good to be trapped in a mountain.

782
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,040
Everyone wants to fight.

783
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,040
But they dare not to fight easily.

784
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,840
I don't expect you to make a contribution.

785
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,440
But I hope you can be safe.

786
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,240
Bi Zhi.

787
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Let's be a simple and happy couple.

788
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,640
Okay?

789
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,640
Okay.

790
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,640
Sisters are separated.

791
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,040
Why don't you see the bridegroom is sad?

792
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,440
The bridegroom has a new wish.

793
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
He is happy.

794
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
What is his new wish?

795
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,240
We finally have a capable man in our family.

796
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Bi Zhi is born with divine power.

797
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,240
That's a good match.

798
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,640
What about our bridegroom's wedding?

799
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,440
It's been a day.

800
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
Why hasn't Marquis Yan made any move?

801
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,840
This is urgent.

802
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,240
We can't afford to be hasty.

803
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,440
Bridegroom.

804
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Bridegroom.

805
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
You haven't seen your bridegroom for a day.

806
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
Why are you drinking tea here?

807
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,240
You sent him out to make a city.

808
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,440
But you promised to help him get rid of it.

809
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Don't be anxious.

810
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,840
Sit.

811
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,640
I...

812
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
We are allied with Wei State.

813
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,840
I have to show some sincerity.

814
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,840
Then you will continue to be disrespected by him?

815
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,640
I have to show my sincerity.

816
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,840
Is that true?

817
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,240
The communication will solve the problem of Wei State.

818
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
Then the Marquis will be safe and sound.

819
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,640
You are right.

820
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,240
If this is done,

821
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,240
Wei State will be stronger.

822
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Yan State is threatened.

823
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,640
But this is a common interest.

824
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,840
At this moment,

825
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,640
if this is done,

826
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,840
our interest will be greater than the interest.

827
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,240
May I ask where does the interest come from?

828
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,280
The

829
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,440
Wei State will be strong.

830
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Even if I don't give it to him, he will definitely grab it.

831
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,840
And the Shi State will use a certain force.

832
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Then he will attack Yan State without any intention of separating himself.

833
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
In this case,

834
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,440
he can give me a chance to pass the chance.

835
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,240
Then I will use this marriage

836
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,840
to turn the situation around.

837
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,840
Now it seems that

838
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
this marriage

839
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,040
can't be done.

840
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,040
What do you mean?

841
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
The Tai Palace

842
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
is dead.

843
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,040
I came here to tell you this.

844
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,840
Sir.

845
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,840
You can't joke about this kind of thing.

846
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,840
When did this happen?

847
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Today

848
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,640
is the day of the Tai Palace's coronation.

849
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
Yilang.

850
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,640
It's a big deal to marry her.

851
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,640
But you can't do it alone.

852
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Father.

853
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,440
Yilang, are you okay?

854
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,440
I misjudged the last time I saw my grandfather.

855
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,640
I'm sorry.

856
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,640
I'm sorry.

857
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm sorry.

858
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I'm sorry.

859
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm sorry.

860
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,640
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,640
I'm sorry.

863
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,640
I'm sorry.

864
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I'm sorry.

865
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,640
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,640
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
I'm sorry.

868
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,640
I'm sorry.

869
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
I'm sorry.

870
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
I'm sorry.

871
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
I'm sorry.

872
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm sorry.

873
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
I'm sorry.

874
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
I'm sorry.

876
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm sorry.

877
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
I'm sorry.

878
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm sorry.

879
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
I'm sorry.

880
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,640
I'm sorry.
