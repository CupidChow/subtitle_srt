30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Then,

31
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,040
what's his true nature?

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
Tough on the outside,
soft on the inside.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,350
Big-hearted.

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,720
Otherwise,

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,800
he wouldn't have allowed you
to stay in Yujun.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,070
If that's the case,

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,350
I've misjudged him.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you for your advice.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,630
Your Go skills are truly remarkable.

40
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,890
I gladly admit defeat.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,910
Greetings, Mother.

42
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,120
Mother, you asked for me.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
What would you like me to do?

44
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,950
I heard from the accountant

45
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,790
that you changed the candle expenses.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,350
We're using yellow candles now.

47
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,790
I'd prefer beeswax candles.

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,440
They burn brighter

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,510
and produce less smoke.

50
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,470
Nonsense!

51
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,470
Zhonglin works tirelessly out there,

52
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,720
while you lounge around in here?

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,840
You don't care for him, fine.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,670
But now you're making

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,840
all kinds of demands?

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,720
Clearly,

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
no daughter-in-law can ever match a mother.

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,350
Only a mother

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,720
can truly love her son.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Mother,

61
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,230
I've checked the household accounts.

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,670
We're under budget
on candles every month.

63
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,670
No extra costs.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
My Lord!

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
Her Ladyship wrote to Yanzhou again.

66
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,440
She didn't ask you.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,320
I held it back.

68
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Have a look.

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,040
Aunt, I've been scared of the dark lately

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
and having trouble sleeping.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,880
Could you please copy me

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,350
the calming and mind-clearing
remedy from Yanzhou?

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
That's it?

74
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,880
All for nothing.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,240
Wait.

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,670
There's a hidden message.

77
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,160
You all are way out of line.

78
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,470
Do what you gotta do.

79
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,440
A hidden message.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,280
Only a few shops in Yujun sell candles.

81
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,110
Big, small, thick, thin,

82
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,080
we've got them all here.

83
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,790
My Lady, we have plenty of
candles here already.

84
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,640
Why do you have to do this?

85
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,600
This candle won't do.

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,720
It smokes too much.

87
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Try this one.

88
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,720
Careful, it's hot.

89
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,040
But this one flickers too much.

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,470
Can't sleep well at night.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Well,

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
it could be.

93
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,760
- You're back home.
- My Lord.

94
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,310
What are you doing?

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,670
The candles we have give off thick smoke,

96
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,640
harsh on the nose,

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,080
and strain the eyes when reading at night.

98
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,520
So I wanted to replace them.

99
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,640
We are not an ordinary couple.

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,400
Just keep up appearances.

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,310
Don't play clever tricks,

102
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,760
trying to snoop into my affairs

103
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,400
and cause a stir in the whole household.

104
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,400
I only changed the candles.

105
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,640
I wasn't trying to snoop into your affairs.

106
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,400
That's for the best.

107
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,760
Her Ladyship

108
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,280
paid for the candles herself.

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,670
She didn't cost you a coin.

110
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,760
I'll have the accountant
send some silver tomorrow.

111
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,550
I rule Wei, a great state.

112
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,200
Do I lack money for a few candles?

113
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,200
I've heard Boya

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,110
used to be part of Wei's holdings.

115
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,110
But because of Qiao's tricks,

116
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,400
the Qiao flag now flies there.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,910
Lady Xu is furious.

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,230
She lectured Lady Qiao

119
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,600
for quite a while.

120
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,110
That's right.

121
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,640
Since she acted without
considering the household,

122
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,720
Mother certainly

123
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,160
won't let her off easily.

124
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,870
Besides,

125
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
it's been over three months

126
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,470
since Zhonglin and she got married.

127
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
They're no longer newlyweds.

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,910
Taking a concubine now

129
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
is definitely not

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
seen as disobedience.

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Actually, Shao approved

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,960
taking a concubine.

133
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,840
Aunt, why not

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
go straight to Lady Qiao

135
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,870
and get her to agree to the match?

136
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,400
If she refuses, go tell Lady Xu herself.

137
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
Lady Qiao is clearly in the wrong.

138
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,720
I guess

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
she doesn't even dare to refuse.

140
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,780
(Betrothal Letter)

141
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,520
This is Zhonglin and Chuyu's
Betrothal Letter.

142
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,280
The 5th of next month is an auspicious day.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,160
Hurry

144
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,720
and prepare for the betrothal.

145
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,790
This matter is of great importance.

146
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,870
I need to ask His Lordship first.

147
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,760
I can't decide on my own.

148
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,990
Is it that you can't decide,

149
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,990
or that you don't want him
to take a concubine?

150
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,790
Zhonglin is

151
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,790
the last of the Wei line.

152
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,230
Everyone in this family is waiting his heir.

153
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,080
But you are still in mourning.

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,600
How is our Wei family

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,910
supposed to carry on?

156
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,110
Then I'll be direct.

157
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,400
I already asked His Lordship

158
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
about taking a concubine.

159
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,720
Neither he

160
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,910
nor Grandmother

161
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,760
agreed to it.

162
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,710
You...

163
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,910
You're using them to pressure me again?

164
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,620
Fine.

165
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll speak plainly today.

166
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,640
Don't think I don't know

167
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,080
it was you who egged Zhonglin

168
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,870
on not to take a concubine.

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,310
I won't argue with you

170
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,640
over all your little schemes.

171
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,910
As long as Zhonglin

172
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,230
takes Chuyu as his concubine,

173
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,230
you can take charge of

174
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,760
everything else.

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,520
You're clever, Mother.

176
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
That's true. I did try to

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,910
dissuade His Lordship.

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
When I first met him,

179
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,400
I was struck by his masculinity.

180
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,870
He set aside our families' old feud

181
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,760
and treated me kindly in Xindu.

182
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,310
From then on, I saw that

183
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,110
he carried the world in his heart.

184
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,470
He's a truly broad-minded man.

185
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,470
Later, in Panyi,

186
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,280
he saved me from danger.

187
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,640
From that moment,

188
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,230
I swore to myself

189
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,670
I would stay by his side forever.

190
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,430
Enough, stop it.

191
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,550
No one wants to hear
your sentimental rambling.

192
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,630
Mother,

193
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
it's all my fault.

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,120
I love His Lordship too deeply.

195
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,550
I can't bear to share him with other women.

196
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,670
You can call me jealous,

197
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,910
or say I'm harsh,

198
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,240
but what new bride,
just months into marriage,

199
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,360
can bear watching

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,790
her mother-in-law arrange
a concubine for her husband?

201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,590
Punish me if you must.

202
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,310
Even if it costs me my life,

203
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,480
I will never accept

204
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,710
Zheng Shu as a concubine in my home.

205
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,710
Enough. That's enough.

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
You want to see me, My Lord?

207
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,070
I heard you told Mother

208
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,790
you have feelings for me.

209
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,310
Is that true?

210
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,910
I only said that

211
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,120
to go along with your wish.

212
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,640
I had no other choice.

213
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,120
You needn't take it seriously.

214
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,160
My wish?

215
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
Aren't you afraid Mother will blame you?

216
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,710
I just don't want you

217
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,430
to do anything you don't want to.

218
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,550
As the master of this household

219
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,830
and ruler of Wei,

220
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,430
you should make your own decisions.

221
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,280
If you want to take Zheng Shu
as your concubine,

222
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,590
I won't stop you.

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
But if you don't want to,

224
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,160
I won't let anyone else

225
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,880
force you into it.

226
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,190
Your words can cut deep,

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,400
but sometimes they're comforting.

228
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,400
I'll take that as a compliment.

229
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,950
But remember this.

230
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
We are not an ordinary couple.

231
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,590
From now on, never...

232
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,000
Never try to seduce you with my beauty.

233
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
I know that.

234
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Very well.

235
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,160
Well, you should head back.

236
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,240
Alright.

237
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
Lady Qiao truly has no shame,

238
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,520
using that excuse to brush me off.

239
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,950
Aunt, please,

240
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,590
marry me off to someone else.

241
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,310
Chuyu...

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,880
I'll never forget you,

243
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,670
and I'll come visit you often.

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,360
Chuyu!

245
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,360
Chuyu!

246
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,670
Once you're gone, I'm left alone.

247
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,760
It's bad enough dealing with
my mother-in-law,

248
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,310
and now I have to face Qiao too.

249
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,430
How can I handle all this?

250
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Tell me, how am I supposed to live like this?

251
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,360
Now that it's come to this,

252
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,640
do you have any ideas left, Aunt?

253
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,880
No, we can't do that.

254
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,400
Chuyu,

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,710
I know

256
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,480
this

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,910
is hard for you.

258
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,310
But now,

259
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,310
there's no other way.

260
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,710
If you refuse,

261
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,830
even I can't help you anymore.

262
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,910
Well, Aunt,

263
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,430
I'll do as you say.

264
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,160
Let me propose a toast first.

265
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,240
Son,

266
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,710
I was born clumsy

267
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,520
and reckless.

268
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,240
I've caused you much trouble.

269
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm sorry for that.

270
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
Let me have three cups to apologize.

271
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,950
No need, Mother.

272
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Please take it easy.

273
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,790
Drink up.

274
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,040
How many cups have I had?

275
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,930
Three.

276
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,070
Three, huh?

277
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,720
No problem.

278
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Here, I'll top off your cup, son.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,790
Eat and drink up.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
- Thank you, Mother.
- Shall we?

281
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Sure.

282
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,360
Ma'am, it's time for your decoction.

283
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,120
What's wrong, Mother?

284
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,190
I've had headaches recently.

285
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,950
I asked the physician for some decoction.

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,590
I was too happy today

287
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,240
and forgot to take it. Let's go.

288
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,400
Shall I come with you?

289
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
No, you stay.

290
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
Watch your step.

291
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,480
My Lord.

292
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,550
Lady Zhu

293
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,880
was planning to come

294
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,280
after taking her decoction,

295
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,910
but somehow,

296
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,520
her headache got worse.

297
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
Even the decoction didn't help.

298
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,240
Please, go check on her.

299
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,430
- Lead the way.
- Yes, My Lord.

300
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,790
My Lady?

301
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,070
His Lordship is here to visit you.

302
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,240
Mother?

303
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,670
Shao.

304
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
Mother?

305
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,400
How does my dress look?

306
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Does it look good?

307
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,400
Shao.

309
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,190
Are you not feeling well?

310
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,830
Shall I

311
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,520
help you rest inside?

312
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Go away.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
I said go away.

314
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,190
- Shao...
- Put on your robe.

315
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,630
Shao,

316
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,070
I have no choice.

317
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,360
Now, I just want

318
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,520
to ease your pain.

319
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,360
Shao, please don't go.

320
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,550
Go away!

321
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,760
Shao!

322
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,280
- My Lord!
- Zhonglin.

323
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,710
- Where are you going?
- Zhonglin.

324
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,550
Go away!

325
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,400
Zhonglin! Zhonglin!

326
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,670
I...

327
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,550
You plotted with an outsider

328
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,190
against your own son?

329
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,310
Zhonglin.

330
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,590
Zhonglin, please.

331
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,790
I can explain.

332
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,720
Look away!

333
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,350
His Lordship is just angry.

334
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,350
Say one word and I'll tear your mouths apart!

335
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,600
Chuyu.

336
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,480
My Lord?

337
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,590
Are you alright?

338
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,960
Shall I call the physician?

339
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
No.

340
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,960
Don't let anyone see me like this.

341
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,520
Get me more water!

342
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,630
Water.

343
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,720
So the one closest to you

344
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,920
should be someone

345
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,550
who sees what you see,

346
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,520
and feels what you feel.

347
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,310
I just don't want you

348
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,920
to do anything you don't want to.

349
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,350
If you want to take Zheng Shu
as your concubine,

350
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,550
I won't stop you.

351
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,310
But if you don't want to,

352
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
I won't let anyone else

353
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,760
- force you into it.
- My Lord?

354
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,280
Things you don't want to tell others,

355
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,630
you can tell her.

356
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,480
- Leave what you don't want others
- My Lord,

357
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,040
- to handle to her.
- are you alright?

358
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,280
Shall we call the physician?

359
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,720
And you can show

360
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,310
your vulnerability to her.

361
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,280
No need.

362
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,830
Your robe is soaked.

363
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,070
Go change it, or you'll catch cold.

364
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,280
I've told you before,

365
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,520
whatever happens with the Qiao family,

366
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,040
I will never let you be without a home.

367
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,630
Do you remember?

368
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,110
Yes.

369
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,870
You said so, My Lord.

370
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,790
My Lord, let go of me.

371
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,520
Let go of me!

372
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,360
Your Lordship!

373
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,150
What's wrong?

374
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,630
Are you drunk?

375
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm still in mourning.

376
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,830
If I've done something wrong,

377
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,630
just tell me directly.

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,240
My Lord, you promised me

379
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,200
on our wedding day in Panyi

380
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,350
that I could mourn Grandfather for a year.

381
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,280
I had something dirty at Mother's.

383
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,520
Bring me some ice.

384
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,920
Mother...

385
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,050
Bring me some ice!

386
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,280
Here's the ice.

387
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,910
Is that enough?

388
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,360
Yes.

389
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,110
My Lord,

390
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll stay right here.

391
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,520
If you need anything,

392
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,070
just say the word.

393
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,910
Alright.

394
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,870
I want some water.

395
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,390
Water.

396
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,630
Here's your water.

397
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,920
I'll get you another cup.

398
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,790
Here.

399
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Bring me my clothes.

400
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,110
Did you get those wounds

401
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,000
in Xiaogang?

402
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,310
Just minor injuries.

403
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,390
Nothing serious.

404
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,420
Are you feeling better now, My Lord?

405
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,060
If you are,

406
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,660
I... I'll take my leave.

407
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,580
Thank you.

408
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,540
His Lordship caught a chill last night.
He's not feeling well.

409
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,180
Keep it down while you're working.

410
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,380
Don't wake him up.

411
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

412
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,460
My Lord, are you feeling better?

413
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,540
No idea what you're talking about.

414
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
Last night,

415
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,820
your old wound flared up, so you used

416
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,340
crushed ice to ease the pain.

417
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,580
I've already ordered the maids

418
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,940
to make ginger tea for you

419
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,340
to drive out the cold.

420
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,140
Thank you, My Lady.

421
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,380
Zhonglin,

422
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,100
it was my fault

423
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,940
for what happened last night.

424
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,540
How could I have been so foolish

425
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,900
to do that?

426
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
After you left last night,

427
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,180
I thought you'd never accept me

428
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,540
as your mother again.

429
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,460
Zhonglin.

430
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,700
I suppose

431
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,340
your grandmother knows about it now.

432
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,380
Yes, it's all my fault.

433
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,340
I'll go to Mother

434
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,700
and ask her to punish me.

435
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,700
Mother, don't worry.

436
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,060
Grandmother knows nothing of this.

437
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,340
I'm not going to tell her

438
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,740
and make her worry.

439
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,020
However,

440
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,100
there's one thing I hope you'll agree to.

441
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,540
Zhonglin,

442
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,860
go on and tell me.

443
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,780
Send Zheng Shu away.

444
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,540
She is never to set foot
in the Wei household again.

445
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,700
But...

446
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,780
I...

447
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,700
I understand. I understand.

448
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,540
It's just that

449
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,380
Chuyu has been

450
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
with me all these years.

451
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,140
She has no one else to rely on.

452
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,660
If I suddenly send her away,

453
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,740
where else would she go?

454
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,700
Zhonglin,

455
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,540
over these years

456
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,340
you've been busy with state affairs,

457
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,540
and it was Chuyu who stayed by my side

458
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,700
and took care of me.

459
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,900
I don't mean anything else.

460
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,940
I just want

461
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,140
to prepare more for her

462
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,620
and find her a good husband.

463
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
It's my way

464
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,860
of thanking her

465
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,660
for the filial care

466
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,420
she's given on your behalf.

467
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,900
No, I...

468
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,500
Please, son.

469
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,100
Three days.

470
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,100
I'll give you three days.

471
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,300
I just hope

472
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,860
you learn your lesson

473
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,540
and never act so foolishly again.

474
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,660
That would be

475
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,060
the greatest blessing for me, as your son.

476
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,660
Zhonglin!

477
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,500
Are you speaking the truth?

478
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,260
I dare not lie, Ma'am.

479
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,380
Ma'am, Her Ladyship is here.

480
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,100
Greetings, Grandmother.

481
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm sorry I got up late today

482
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,660
and kept you waiting.

483
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,860
I deserve punishment.

484
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,660
You may all leave.

485
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,580
Come here.

486
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,900
Sit.

487
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,230
I called you here

488
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,820
to ask about something.

489
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,380
I heard last night

490
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Zhonglin got angry at Lady Zhu

491
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,780
and Zheng Shu in the east wing

492
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,170
and even kicked down the doors.

493
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,780
I honestly don't know

494
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,100
what happened in the east wing.

495
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,100
You're a sensible girl.

496
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,060
Zhonglin finds it hard

497
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,620
to speak openly with me now,

498
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,580
so I'm asking you.

499
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,380
What exactly happened

500
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,700
last night?

501
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,140
Grandmother,

502
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,220
I really don't know.

503
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,220
What about him asking

504
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,740
for ice in the middle of the night?

505
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,510
You don't know that either?

506
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,220
Lately, while caring for His Lordship,

507
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,580
I noticed new wounds on his back,

508
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,740
probably from the Xiaogang battle.

509
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,020
They haven't fully healed yet.

510
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,020
I presume

511
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,180
he used ice to ease the pain.

512
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,020
But please don't worry, Grandmother.

513
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,660
I've asked the maids

514
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,220
to prepare more ginger tea
for him to drive out the cold.

515
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,420
He should be fine.

516
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
Alright,

517
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,300
I see.

518
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,540
You've stayed up all night tending to him.

519
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,620
You must be tired.

520
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,020
Go back and have some rest.

521
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,700
Then I'll take my leave.

522
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,540
Very well.

523
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
Ma'am,

524
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,420
it seems Her Ladyship

525
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,860
doesn't know about this.

526
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,420
Luckily,

527
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,420
we got the truth

528
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,780
from the east wing maids.

529
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,940
That's some clever talk.

530
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,420
She's usually sharp-tongued,

531
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,780
witty and eloquent.

532
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,460
She knows how to say nothing

533
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,060
when things get sensitive.

534
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,580
If you push her too hard,

535
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,620
she'll just make something up to fool you.

536
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,180
She's so tight-lipped.

537
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,500
So,

538
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,700
Her Ladyship deceived you, Ma'am.

539
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,300
Yet somehow I feel

540
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,900
you're not angry with her.

541
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,980
She was preserving Zhonglin's dignity

542
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,780
by covering for his mother.

543
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,580
Ma'am,

544
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,940
just admit it.

545
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,380
At this point,

546
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,900
no matter how you look at it,

547
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,740
you've grown fond of Her Ladyship,

548
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,980
haven't you?

549
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,860
I only care because she cares for Zhonglin.

550
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,380
Since she holds him dear,

551
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,860
I can't help but care for her too.

552
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,940
I truly hope she and Zhonglin

553
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,700
can be a loving couple.

554
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,540
Indeed.

555
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,540
That foolish Zhu

556
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,780
isn't even a match for a young girl.

557
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,820
She is utterly ignorant!

558
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
Aunt.

559
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,220
If Lady Qiao

560
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,540
had even half your thoughtfulness,

561
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,300
I wouldn't have been

562
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,100
humiliated in front of my own son.

563
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,140
You two make such a devoted aunt

564
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,700
and niece.

565
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,580
Mother.

566
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,020
Mother...

567
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,980
Ma... Ma'am.

568
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,100
What brings you here?

569
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,340
If you need anything,

570
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,300
have a servant call me.

571
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,580
I'll be right away.

572
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,860
- Maids.
- Yes, Ma'am.

573
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,780
Send Zheng Shu away immediately.

574
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,420
I don't want to see her again.

575
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,420
Mother!

576
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,100
- Ma'am...
- Please, show mercy.

577
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,380
- Aunt!
- Mother!

578
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Ma'am!

579
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,540
- Aunt!
- Mother!

580
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,380
- I know you and your niece are close.
- Aunt!

581
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,140
- I won't let her suffer.
- Ma'am, I admit my fault!

582
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,340
Though Zheng Shu

583
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,540
is an orphan,

584
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,700
she still has uncles.

585
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,540
Ma'am has

586
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,940
prepared a dowry for her

587
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,820
and will find her a good husband.

588
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,580
Lady Zhu,

589
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,220
are you satisfied?

590
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,540
Mother, I will

591
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,220
follow your arrangements.

592
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,780
My Lord, let go of me.

593
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,500
Let go of me!

594
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,620
What is it?

595
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Her Ladyship worried
the chill might make you sick,

596
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,220
so she sent some decoction.

597
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,210
She hopes you feel better.

598
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,500
Anything happened

599
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,820
in the household today?

600
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,540
Her Ladyship visited Lady Xu,

601
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,220
and then Lady Xu went to see Lady Zhu.

602
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,980
That's all I know.

603
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,340
I heard Lady Xu scolded Lady Zhu
in the east wing today

604
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,060
and sent her to meditate
at the ancestral hall.

605
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,020
But I don't know what really happened.

606
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,940
What could it be?

607
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,260
Mother must've upset Grandmother again.

608
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,420
That's not unusual.

609
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,660
I hope she learns her lesson this time.

610
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,180
But it won't be easy.

611
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,420
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

612
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,260
My Lord, please have a seat.

613
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,580
I heard

614
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,740
Grandmother called for you early
this morning.

615
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,620
Yes.

616
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,940
But don't worry, My Lord.

617
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,020
I didn't tell Grandmother a single word

618
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,060
about what happened last night.

619
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,420
No one else knows either,

620
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,580
not even Chunniang.

621
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,900
Let's eat.

622
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,500
(Healing Powder)

623
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,780
My Lord.

624
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,420
Are you afraid of me?

625
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,820
I just...

626
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm just worried about your wound.

627
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,860
(Healing Powder)

628
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,860
Don't worry.

629
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,900
What happened yesterday

630
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,660
won't happen again. I promise.

631
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,260
We need to supervise
the Yongning Canal in a few days.

632
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,100
Whose turn is it?

633
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,980
I'm too young. I'm not going.

634
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,540
I can't leave the tavern maid
at Luozhong Tavern.

635
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,980
Wei Xiao, you should go.

636
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,900
Let's draw straws.

637
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,220
What? Again? No way.

638
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,100
You only draw straws when no one wants to go.

639
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,180
I'm not drawing.

640
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,980
Just get it over with, so we...

641
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,500
What are you mumbling? So annoying!

642
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,340
My Lord,

643
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,780
what's wrong?

644
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,900
He said he's staying at
the Government Office for now.

645
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,620
Probably had another fight with Her Ladyship.

646
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,780
Finished the military embezzlement case?

647
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,100
Yes, the ringleader's caught.

648
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,220
He'll be executed soon.

649
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,620
Then you're just idling around here?

650
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,860
No, we're not.

651
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,380
The Yongning Canal is almost finished.

652
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,740
We were talking about

653
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
who should go inspect it in a few days.

654
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,580
It's not a big deal.

655
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,060
Advisor said

656
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,740
it doesn't matter who goes.

657
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,620
Just bring a few men and make it official.

658
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,820
Since it's not a big deal, why's it

659
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,660
taking so long?

660
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
I'll go myself.

661
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,700
It's just a routine check to Panyi.

662
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,820
You don't have to go...

663
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,660
Enough!

664
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,380
I said I'm going. That's final.

665
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,020
Yes, My Lord.

His Lordship said he caught a chill.

688
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,460
But why hasn't he come back for days?

689
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,060
Hiding from me, I guess.

690
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,300
He's hiding from you, My Lady?

691
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,100
Afraid I'll catch his illness.

692
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,500
That's rather considerate of him.

693
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,620
Quite the planner.

694
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,060
Planner?

695
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,460
What plan?

696
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,700
Nothing.

697
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,420
I just think he's trying to balance

698
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,460
his mother's dignity and his filial duty.

699
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,940
I feel a bit sorry for him.

700
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,060
Go tell him

701
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,260
to come home later.

702
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,380
I'm not afraid of chills.

703
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,980
Greetings, My Lady.

704
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,500
Why are you packing so much?

705
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,860
His Lordship has official duties?

706
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,540
In two days, His Lordship will go to Panyi.

707
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,940
He asked us to get his things packed.

708
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,460
What's the trip to Panyi about?

709
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,460
The Yongning Canal project is almost done.

710
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,740
Someone needs to inspect it.

711
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,060
His Lordship insists on

712
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,140
going himself.

713
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,460
Just a routine inspection?

714
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,740
Why not let Wei Liang go?

715
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,060
Now he's going to Panyi to hide from me?

716
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,380
Any other orders, My Lady?

717
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,740
There you are, My Lady.

718
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,620
I've been looking everywhere.

719
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,020
Lady Zhu said

720
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,220
since she went to meditate
at the ancestral hall,

721
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,620
she hasn't seen you for days.

722
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,860
She asks you to come, My Lady.

723
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,940
I should visit Mother.

724
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,620
Chuyu's been

725
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,220
by my side all these years.

726
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,860
Now that I'm sending her away,

727
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,540
it should be done with dignity.

728
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,540
If you hadn't tattled,

729
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,220
why would Lady Xu

730
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,700
have ordered Chuyu

731
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,740
to leave with no delay?

732
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,460
Is stealing my Zhonglin not enough?

733
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,860
Now you're driving away

734
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,300
my only niece, aren't you?

735
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,940
You're being way too cruel.

736
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Did your father teach you of this?

737
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,180
Grandmother ordered you
to kneel in the ancestral hall.

738
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,020
You must be exhausted.

739
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,420
I shall take my leave.

740
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:22,860
Stop right there!

741
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,660
Did I say you could leave?

742
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,420
If it weren't for your meddling,

743
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,740
Zhonglin would've married Chuyu long ago.

744
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,260
But now, he's lost face

745
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,460
with both his family

746
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,780
and ancestors.

747
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,560
Seems like your time kneeling
in the ancestral hall

748
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,620
hasn't taught you Grandmother's wishes.

749
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,460
Insolence!

750
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,500
How dare you talk back?

751
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,220
Of course you're the enemy's daughter.

752
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,780
You don't even come close to my Chuyu.

753
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,900
True.

754
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,020
You've always wanted Zheng Shu
to marry His Lordship.

755
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,340
Despite all his refusals,

756
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,220
you still pushed on.

757
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,660
You even schemed just to make it happen.

758
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,820
Now that everything's come to light,

759
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,780
all you care about is Zheng Shu.

760
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,900
What about His Lordship's dignity?

761
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,340
Everyone says you love your son,

762
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,660
but do you really?

763
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,380
You want Zheng Shu to be his concubine.

764
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,140
You tampered with the box

765
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,660
for her sake.

766
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,020
You even drugged His Lordship,

767
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,420
all for Zheng Shu.

768
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,940
His Lordship is the ruler of Wei.

769
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,780
His marriage should serve the greater good.

770
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,740
The marriage alliance is taking effect,

771
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,180
but you keep interfering.

772
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,260
I'm afraid you don't want His Lordship

773
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,540
to truly take the throne!

774
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,700
