The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Episode 2

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Cousin

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your penmanship is so elegant

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's really like a man

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And it has the fragrance of ink

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You and your sister

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are so perfect

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you, cousin

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But my grandmother's birthday is coming

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So I'm here

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
To do some decoration

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't expect to show my grudge in front of you

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The ink is gone

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll go get some

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't worry, sister

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm here today

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To thank you

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't do anything for cousin

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do you thank me?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's my fault

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I misunderstood you in the past

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't expect you to do so much for the people

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You didn't help me to make money

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You even wrote a letter to my family

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
To beg for wheat seeds

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I also know you read the book

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Book of Wind and Waves

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You wrote the land, rain and water of Rong County

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
To the people

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To get the wheat seeds

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm so narrow-minded

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I thought you wrote a letter to the people

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To beg for foreign enemies

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If it wasn't for you

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
To read it to me

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I didn't know you were so righteous

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I thank you for the people of Rong County

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,960
The News of the

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
The South Army is too much

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Weiliang must have known it long ago

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I even helped him to calculate

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How to transport food to Rong County

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't say a few words

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You are not a mess

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't bear to see the women's army so angry

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Our women's army is originally a distant family

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's hard to talk to my family in the letter

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Lan Jun even wants to see this?

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,720
He just wants to read the letter.

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,360
He even read it to Shi Junting.

59
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
Exactly.

60
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,640
Yan Mo.

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm going to deliver the letter to Yan Zhu.

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,560
You're still going?

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,200
Dugu.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,000
The female army has a letter to send to Yan Zhu.

65
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Read it.

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Which letter?

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,400
It's Miss Wu's letter.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,860
Let's head back to our hometown.

69
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,240
Come on.

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Let's go.

71
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Whom's là?

72
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
Who sent you a letter to Yan Zhu?

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My throat is not feeling well.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You read it.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Here.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't read much.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know the words.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go back to study.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I usually ask you to read more.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But you don't listen.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now it's so simple.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Master is wise.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You don't have to read this letter.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's good.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just said it.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can guess what it says.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
At most, add a song to the song.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's like

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The South Army is the new world.

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The great country has this army.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's the people's faith.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's it.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't read it.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Xiaotang, go on with the驗州.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't do this.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go on.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's a master's name on it.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let me see.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Give it to me.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's wrong with you today?

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Master, calm down.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It must be the female army

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
who made the master

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to watch the letter.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's really you.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's our fault.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't be rude.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes, master.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
At worst, you can hide in the kitchen for one more night.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
To avoid you from finding Jingfeng Junyu.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hide?

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you kidding me?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm definitely going to find him.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Li Yifan.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This Hanfu is getting more and more over.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not kidding.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not kidding.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not kidding.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The King of the Palace

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm busy with work today.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm a little tired.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll take a break.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The South Army has to watch everything in person.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's hard not to be tired.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You've been working hard

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
on your grandmother's birthday party these days.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Have a good rest.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The South Army's birthday party

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the menu for grandmother's birthday party.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The South Army, please have a look.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You decided on yourself?

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This kind of little thing.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I just got into the house.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not sure

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
if it's a good idea to eat.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're so busy.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just want to eat.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't want to eat.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You eat a lot.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm full.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm full.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
we still know

146
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,200
everyone's preference and strong culture.

147
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
It would be bad

148
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,040
if someone gets sick

149
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,200
and others get borrow-made.

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,880
I'd like you to take a look.

151
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,400
All right.

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,040
Good,

153
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
The color is not bad.

154
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
It's not picky.

155
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,040
Go to bed early.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,040
This is the account book

157
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
for the grandmother's birthday banquet.

158
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,280
Please have a look.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,040
If there is one more

160
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
or one less,

161
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
and the account book is not right,

162
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,200
it will be a problem.

163
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Go to bed early.

164
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
It's a problem.

165
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,520
No problem.

166
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,360
When preparing

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,960
for the grandmother's birthday banquet,

168
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
the account book is not right.

169
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
There are eight types of

170
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,280
written words on this scroll.

171
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Please have a look and decide for me.

172
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
Wei Xiao, you...

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Get up!

174
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Get up!

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Get up!

176
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,120
What did you call me?

177
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
What do you care about?

178
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
Why did you peek at my letter?

179
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,400
You...

180
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,320
You dare to know my name?

181
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,280
I'm telling you.

182
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
You were just a bad guy.

183
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
Now you're being unreasonable.

184
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
I have nothing to say to you.

185
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm the only one

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
who would marry you.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,920
You're the one who's having fun.

188
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,760
Come back!

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,440
You're a bad guy.

190
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,800
You're always acting like a ghost.

191
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
You just know how to run.

192
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm a good person.

193
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,600
You have small eyes and sharp teeth.

194
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
You're the best of all.

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,240
Come back!

196
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
How dare you throw me away?

197
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,200
I...

198
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,480
I won't argue with you anymore.

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,160
I won't open it.

200
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,760
Why not?

201
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,520
Why did you open it?

202
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,480
Why didn't youever see me?

203
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,920
Let's talk inside first.

204
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,480
Come on.

205
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,160
Stop joking.

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,160
Five Great�

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,400
This little girl

208
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,840
dares to call her name in the middle of the forest.

209
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,160
It's interesting.

210
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,880
Your Majesty,

211
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,080
would you like to use it first?

212
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
I did something wrong.

213
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,840
I just want to apologize.

214
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
What's wrong with Nan Jun?

215
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,000
Exactly.

216
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,480
He slept in the study last night.

217
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,360
That's fine.

218
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,600
He didn't even come back for dinner today.

219
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
He's being careful.

220
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Xiao Tao, Xiao Zao,

221
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,240
don't talk about Nan Jun like that.

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,000
When Nan Jun comes back,

223
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,680
don't show him your face.

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,600
I know.

225
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,920
I wouldn't dare.

226
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,680
Mi Jun,

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,360
when Nan Jun comes back,

228
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
talk to him.

229
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
There's nothing we can't talk about.

230
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,200
Since we're neighbors,

231
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,040
let's just let bygones be bygones.

232
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,280
I know what to do.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Yes.

234
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
Mi Jun, Xiaotan is here.

235
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,920
Ask her in.

236
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,720
Yes.

237
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Mi Jun,

238
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080
Nan Jun said

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,480
he wouldn't come back for dinner.

240
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,480
Look.

241
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,560
Nan Jun is trying to avoid her.

242
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Our Mi Jun hasn't said anything yet.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,720
She must be very upset.

244
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,760
Shut up.

245
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
Go get the ink.

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,320
I need to tell Zhang Jian about this

247
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,400
in case he says something important in his heart.

248
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes.

249
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,480
Zhang Jian,

250
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,000
you look like a girl.

251
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
Since my brother-in-law took off his beard,

252
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,320
Yu Jun has been busy

253
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,720
and has been writing letters to Zhang Jian.

254
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
But Marquis Wei and Man Man

255
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,760
are both worried about him.

256
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,920
They hope Zhang Jian and his brother-in-law

257
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,880
can have a smooth life in Boya.

258
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
If they have any difficulties,

259
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
they can write to us anytime.

260
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,360
When Marquis Wei and Man Man see the letter,

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
they will send someone to Boya.

262
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
General.

263
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,080
Fan.

264
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,960
Thank you for your hard work today.

265
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,560
Did everything go well?

266
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,240
Everything is fine.

267
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Don't worry, Fan.

268
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,200
This is a letter from the female army.

269
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,400
The female army must have said

270
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,440
that they want us to have a good life in Boya.

271
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,320
Man Man said

272
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
that the battle in Boya

273
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,680
has led Marquis Wei to be wary

274
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,200
and reminded me to be careful with him in the future.

275
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,480
The human hero

276
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
lives in arms,

277
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,680
but the man butler

278
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,160
live in the dream.

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,760
Marquis Wei

280
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,520
has never felt this way.

281
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,440
He loves you.

282
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
Only your strength

283
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,080
can help him still feel like he is alive.

284
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Xin Ru?

285
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,640
Xin Ru...

286
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
It 여기서 Wille拿着皮丹

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Yes.

288
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,360
It's a Buddhist scripture

289
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,120
that Madam Taifu copied.

290
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,560
You want me to read it?

291
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
The female emperor said

292
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,880
the Buddhist scripture needed you to read it.

293
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
If you copied it wrong,

294
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,920
you would disrespect Buddha

295
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,160
and make Madam Taifu unhappy.

296
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,560
This Han woman

297
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,720
is unreasonable.

298
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
The female emperor asked you

299
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,800
when you would be back.

300
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Go back and tell her

301
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm still sleeping in the study tonight.

302
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
The study window is open.

303
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,640
It's cold last night.

304
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,720
The male emperor can't sleep at night.

305
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
If you stay here for another night,

306
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
you might catch a cold.

307
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,360
You...

308
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Wei Tuo.

309
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,880
Greetings, Master.

310
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
When did you come back?

311
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,520
I just got in the city.

312
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,480
I can't drink water.

313
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,360
So I came to report to you.

314
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,240
What's the good news?

315
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,240
Master, you allowed me to study in the city.

316
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,520
I didn't slack off.

317
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,040
These are the various scriptures

318
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,680
written by Pan Yi, the Magistrate of the County, and Yang Feng.

319
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm here to show you.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,680
Yang Feng.

321
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,600
Yang Feng

322
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
is working in Yao Palace.

323
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,040
I went to Pan Yi to figure out

324
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,480
the benefits of water source.

325
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,560
The rich people of Yan State

326
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,880
should all return to the palace to enjoy the water.

327
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,080
The wheat produced by Pan Yi is large in quantity

328
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
and has a lot of starch.

329
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,960
It's full of wheat grain and full of wheat grain.

330
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,080
It tastes great.

331
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
This is the wheat produced by Pan Yi.

332
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,720
This is the wheat produced by Xin Du.

333
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,880
The Magistrate of the County said

334
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:30,100
that after the

335
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,440
If you continue to cultivate water,

336
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
you will invest more manpower and wealth.

337
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,520
This will involve the military power of Wei State.

338
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,400
If Yan State comes to the crime,

339
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,320
Wei State will be in danger.

340
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
The Qiao family will benefit from it.

341
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
In my opinion,

342
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
you don't have to be so afraid of the Qiao family.

343
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
Although cultivation can be done

344
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
according to the order of the years of Yan State,

345
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,720
the people who gather the army

346
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,640
will be able to make great contributions to Wei State.

347
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,080
Let me think about it again.

348
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,280
Master.

349
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,840
We will be on duty outside the city tonight.

350
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
If we don't leave now,

351
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,560
I'm afraid it will delay the business.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
If there is nothing else,

353
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
we will take our leave.

354
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,160
Then let's go.

355
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,160
Let's go.

356
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,280
Master.

357
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,240
Master, you haven't gone home yet.

358
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,760
Are you still arguing with the female army

359
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
because of the letter?

360
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,600
How is this possible?

361
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Nothing.

362
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
That's good.

363
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,320
The female army should be waiting for the master to return home.

364
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,920
They should be waiting.

365
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,960
Okay.

366
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,040
I'll leave first.

367
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,000
I suddenly remembered

368
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,240
that I haven't been to the military house for a long time

369
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,160
to visit my mother.

370
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
It's okay. It's okay.

371
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,240
No. No.

372
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
It's better to be there on the day of death.

373
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,440
How about this?

374
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll go to your house for a short time

375
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
to visit Master.

376
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,920
Let's go, Master.

377
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Very good.

378
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,960
It's good to be here.

379
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
Who would have thought that the master

380
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
would keep us here so late?

381
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,040
Only the Ninth Division is open now.

382
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
The Ninth Division is good.

383
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,920
It's a big place.

384
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
Let's go and see it.

385
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,360
That's right.

386
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,240
Where are you going?

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,560
Master.

388
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Didn't you say you would be on duty?

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,560
Master.

390
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,120
I was wrong.

391
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,320
Master.

392
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,760
They are willing to accept me as a guest.

393
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,880
They can punish me if they want.

394
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,880
Master, punish me.

395
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,360
Punish me.

396
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,120
I'm the one who punishes the brother.

397
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,320
No.

398
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,520
You shouldn't bring us out.

399
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm the one who is willing to go out.

400
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,880
Punish me.

401
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Enough.

402
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,960
It's my turn.

403
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,720
Thank you, Master.

404
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,560
Thank you, Master.

405
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,240
Nan Jun.

406
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
Where are we going now?

407
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
We've been wandering for so long.

408
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,120
To see my grandmother.

409
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,440
Great Madam.

410
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
You went to bed two hours ago.

411
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,320
It's so late.

412
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm afraid only a place like Luo's House

413
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,000
can keep the peace.

414
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Zhuo Lin.

415
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,320
After my cousin's adulthood,

416
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,440
when did he suffer such a tragedy?

417
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
He was always surrounded by beautiful women.

418
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,560
I never thought

419
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,240
that he would be surrounded by beautiful men.

420
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,200
I came to visit you with good intentions.

421
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,120
I'm sorry.

422
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,520
I didn't mean to hurt you.

423
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,520
I didn't mean to hurt you.

425
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,200
I didn't mean to hurt you.

427
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,960
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

429
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,680
It's too late.

430
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
It's not convenient to go back.

431
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,240
So I'll just give you a bowl of rice.

432
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
Just a bowl of rice.

433
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,640
Naughty.

434
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,080
Brother.

435
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,040
I didn't mean to blame you.

436
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,120
I just want to ask you

437
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,760
why you told him

438
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,840
that I was peeking at Qiao Zhi's new house.

439
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,880
Sun, I know

440
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,600
you always take him as a member of the Qiao family.

441
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
You don't trust him.

442
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,360
I think the Qiao family and Weiguo

443
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,720
don't really trust each other.

444
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I want to know

445
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,880
if they really

446
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
don't trust Xiuqu.

447
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,280
I've made up my mind

448
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
about Xiuqu.

449
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,360
I believe you.

450
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,160
You've made up your mind.

451
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,240
Zhong Li.

452
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,880
Are you still sleeping?

453
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm going to bed first.

454
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,080
Go to bed.

455
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
넘기기

456
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,120
Giveっちゃ아

457
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,320
Young Master, kill Wei Hou

458
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,280
and kill the fire scaler for Handan

459
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
you have one evening

460
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
during the marriage ceremony

461
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,600
before the new pickle is stolen.

462
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,840
No.

463
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,080
Zhongling and Qiao's Dre Kristin be earns me trouble.

464
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,840
I need to be patient for a moment longer.

465
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Wei State will take over Bianzhou.

466
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,280
Wei Hou is dead.

467
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Bianzhou has no future.

468
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
This is a long-term plan.

469
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,480
Wei Hou is in danger.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,760
I've put the poison in his tea.

471
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,800
Please don't lose your brother's good chance

472
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
because you're too soft-hearted.

473
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I won't go to the Alliance.

474
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Even if you want to kill Qiao Shi,

475
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I won't stop you.

476
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,080
But I've told him that

477
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,840
I want to

478
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,120
kill my brother.

479
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,120
It's impossible.

480
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
You think you're from the Wei family.

481
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,080
But the Wei family doesn't think so.

482
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,160
You're a cultured man.

483
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
But you've been in the Wei family for years.

484
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,600
They spread rumors outside

485
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
that you're a family man.

486
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,280
You're not respected.

487
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,720
Why do you feel wronged?

488
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,680
If you hadn't been in Bianzhou a year ago

489
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,120
and met the General,

490
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,600
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

491
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,200
You're so nice to me.

492
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,400
Yes.

493
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,200
You grew up under the Xu family.

494
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,760
But he's been ignoring you for years.

495
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,760
He didn't even say a word.

496
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,920
He's always strict.

497
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,720
Can't you see what he's doing?

498
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
He's just trying to protect you

499
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,920
and keep you from the military power.

500
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,160
You can't defy me.

501
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,480
If you mention it again,

502
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,920
I'll make you go back to Bianzhou alive.

503
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,800
Young Mistress.

504
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,440
Go back.

505
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Q 쥗

506
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,820
traveled over to Zheng meeting

507
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,400
but he admitted missing!

508
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,980
They're just dead.

509
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,240
Speak of the devil.

510
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,160
Aren't you giving all those translated requests

511
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,360
to the Accent Seekers?

512
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,340
And why is only Single تع Chairman

513
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,340
in our team?

514
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,240
He's been dead for this entire time.

515
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,240
We shouldn't worry.

516
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,920
He's always straight to the fourth hall,

517
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,080
we wouldn't get carried away

518
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,680
to help him to get the pulse.

519
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Anyway,

520
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,040
he won't remember the good of women.

521
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,200
What do you think of him?

522
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,880
It's true.

523
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,000
He was a good man

524
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,600
to the wife of the governor and Mrs. Zhu.

525
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,680
He was very nice to her.

526
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
But in the world of reading letters,

527
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,800
he was very despicable.

528
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,320
He was very bad to her.

529
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
It can only show that

530
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,800
he was very clear about the company.

531
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,720
The mother-in-law and the cousin's mischief

532
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,240
were family matters.

533
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,280
He could keep his wife's trust.

534
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
But I believe in Yan State.

535
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,680
It's a matter of the security of the Wei State.

536
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,920
As the master of the Wei State,

537
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
he was entrusted by the people.

538
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,360
Of course he wouldn't trust Yan State.

539
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,680
Although he was angry with the man,

540
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
he was clear about the company.

541
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,840
Yes, we are talking about Yan State.

542
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,720
Yan State is compact in nature.

543
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
There is nothing to worry about.

544
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,920
To be honest,

545
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,060
it's too easy to handle for a families.

546
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,880
We need to strengthen the seaworthiness.

547
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,800
Well,

548
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,320
Yellow Chinese Army has its own stories.

549
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,460
Y due

550
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,520
will be later opened.

551
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,040
There's one thing

553
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
that needs to be decided.

554
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,440
Please go ahead.

555
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,200
General Wei Duo,

556
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,640
tell us

557
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,680
what kind of person Yang Feng is.

558
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,480
He's

559
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,160
the best at saving money.

560
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,360
What do you mean?

561
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,680
He and Zhen Zhi

562
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,600
work in the capital

563
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,120
and in the city.

564
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,080
The salary is much higher

565
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
than in the capital.

566
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,920
He's a fast learner.

567
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,000
He must save money.

568
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,360
He can adjust the plan

569
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,880
according to the terrain, terrain, and weather.

570
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,240
He can order the people

571
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,680
to dig the soil in the river

572
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,560
and save money for free.

573
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,240
Master,

574
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
the Rong County is a city

575
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,880
with hundreds of thousands of people.

576
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,640
All generals are good at leading troops

577
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,680
but not good at water control.

578
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,960
There's no suitable person

579
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,600
in the capital.

580
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,320
The military counselor

581
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,720
wants to recommend Yang Feng to me.

582
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
Yang Feng can save money

583
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,440
and he's the new wife of the female army.

584
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,120
If you can use Yang Feng,

585
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
you can express your trust

586
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,320
in the female army and the Yan State.

587
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
What does this have to do with him?

588
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,920
Yes.

589
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,080
You're important to the overall situation.

590
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,200
The

591
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,000
Uncle,

592
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,280
my sister wants to sell the seed to be the birthday gift.

593
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,080
Why do you disband the ancestral thought?

594
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
You know nothing.

595
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,560
It's a birthday gift.

596
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
It's a good thing

597
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,800
to dig up the foundation of Yan State.

598
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,160
Once Wei State is defeated,

599
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
it will be re-established within a few years.

600
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,760
Who can guarantee that

601
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
it won't attack Yan State?

602
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,320
You're being too serious.

603
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,160
Now the two families of Qiao Wei

604
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
are allies and relatives.

605
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
This won't happen.

606
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,240
With my sister here,

607
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,080
she won't let Marquis Wei send troops.

608
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Manman is smart.

609
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,600
Selling seeds is important to Yan State.

610
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,360
If it's not urgent

611
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
or beneficial,

612
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,440
she won't come to ask for it.

613
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
Brother, just give it to her

614
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,320
to avoid Manman's difficulty.

615
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,440
Father and I are both resisting.

616
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
My sister will definitely make plans for Yan State.

617
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,600
Well.

618
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,800
Well.

619
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,120
When father was alive,

620
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,840
he helped Wei State many times.

621
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,920
Since Manman insists on selling seeds,

622
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,320
just give it to her.

623
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,520
Master, you have a letter from Duke Qiao.

624
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,720
Pass me the letter.

625
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,560
I don't need any letter from the two states.

626
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,920
As long as they find this man,

627
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,560
we will definitely fix it.

628
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,020
You...

629
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,640
Why are you so rude,

630
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,440
doubtful and un River?

631
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm unwilling to listen to their mistake to humiliate the students.

632
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,640
Your hands.

633
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
Your body is very precious to me.

634
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Oh, I just remembered something.

635
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,800
You probably don't know about this news, right?

636
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,800
I've decided to retire from the army.

637
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Nan Jun is smart.

638
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,360
I've thought about this for a long time.

639
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,600
But I've decided to do it as you want.

640
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,640
Are you satisfied now?

641
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,480
What about the military teacher?

642
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,440
The military teacher...

643
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,680
I've tried to persuade him for a long time.

644
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,480
He doesn't have any other opinions.

645
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,160
So it's the military teacher's idea.

646
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,680
Then I have to thank the military teacher.

647
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,280
Also, I've decided to use Yang Feng as the governor of the military.

648
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,480
Although I know Yang Feng is your...

649
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,280
I have to thank the military teacher.

650
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,680
This retirement ceremony is about Yan State and Weiguo.

651
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,480
You can tell me what you think.

652
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,280
Nan Jun is so smart. He can make his own decision.

653
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Yan State

654
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,680
Report!

655
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,280
Master, General Chen Pang wants to see you.

656
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,080
It's the rules of the ancestors to pray in Yishan every year.

657
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,880
How can I change the formation without permission because of you?

658
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,280
How can I explain to the ancestors and the general?

659
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
Uncle, don't worry.

660
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,280
Madam is not feeling well today.

661
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,080
I should accompany her.

662
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,480
I'll go to pray again some other day.

663
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,680
The stars will be bright.

664
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
Report!

665
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,480
Master, the Changsheng inn in Yishan collapsed suddenly.

666
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,080
The pilgrims who went to pray were all buried under the ruins.

667
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
No one survived.

668
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Your flower shop is also fragrant.

669
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
It's different from the one in the sea.

670
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,680
There is no earthquake and no rain.

671
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,280
Why did the Changsheng inn collapse suddenly?

672
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,080
Maybe it was the arrangement of the person who wanted to do it.

673
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Don't be so thoughtful.

674
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Uncle, I'm tired today.

675
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,680
I won't keep you any longer.

676
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Master, Madam, do you want to call the teacher to come?

677
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,480
It's okay.

678
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Don't worry, Madam.

679
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,880
I don't know if this flower shop can help people to conquer the world.

680
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,080
But I hope this flower shop can bring good fortune

681
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,280
and keep my husband safe and healthy.

682
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,080
He will be fine.

683
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,280
I'm so happy to have you by my side.

684
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,280
What can you bid me to teach today?

685
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,480
What can I do for you, and please tell me?

686
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,740
...for all the potatoes to go to Long Jun.

687
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,740
Water Lake

688
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,020
헯a 첫 connecting the yards in the capital

689
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:31,640
them the farm and my era

690
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,420
I can leave with dad

691
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,720
and settle everything.

692
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,340
Boss, do you know

693
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,860
Madam Xu of the Wei family

694
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,420
is my great-grandmother.

695
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,300
When I was a child,

696
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,900
I grew up in the Wei family.

697
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,260
I experienced the death

698
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,660
of the three generations of the Wei family

699
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,700
with Marquis Wei.

700
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,700
Now,

701
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,020
we just need to stir up a little

702
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,380
to awaken hatred

703
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,700
and break the Qiao Wei Alliance.

704
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,180
Zhong Lin.

705
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,860
Zhong Lin.

706
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,340
Do you know what's

707
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,700
growing on this land?

708
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,580
It's...

709
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,420
rat.

710
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,460
Shi Yuan.

711
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,700
Do you know it?

712
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,380
I only know that

713
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,740
high-quality wine is thick,

714
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,980
and rice wine is sweet.

715
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
But I don't know

716
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,820
what kind of wine it is.

717
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,220
You're wandering around.

718
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,140
You don't know the Wugu.

719
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,260
Great-grandmother,

720
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,420
if you ask me

721
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,140
what kind of beautiful child

722
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,500
I can make.

723
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,980
Nonsense.

724
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,980
Qiao Shi.

725
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,500
Do you know?

726
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,940
Shi Ji.

727
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,580
It's the bone we often talk about.

728
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
As for the child,

729
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,220
I'm not as good as your grandfather, Mr. Qiao.

730
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,660
You've been preparing for the birthday banquet recently.

731
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,500
Is there anything urgent?

732
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,860
I'm arranging

733
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,500
the banquet and the guest.

734
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,140
The list of guests has been sent down.

735
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
Don't worry, aunt.

736
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,340
I've asked my mother-in-law

737
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,500
about the things I don't understand.

738
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,100
The arrangement is simple.

739
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,780
In fact, it's very well-rounded.

740
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,220
On the surface,

741
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,460
it's close to the book,

742
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,540
and the level of the key is high.

743
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,740
In private,

744
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,460
whoever has a good relationship with God

745
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,740
and wants to sit at the same table,

746
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,420
whoever doesn't deal with God,

747
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,860
they have to stay away from each other.

748
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,940
There can't be any mistake,

749
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,780
or people will complain.

750
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,340
I have a guest from Bianzhou

751
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,500
who is not on the list.

752
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,380
He's my close descendant.

753
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,420
Bianzhou?

754
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,500
Is it Mrs. Yulou?

755
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,540
Yes.

756
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,100
When arranging the seat,

757
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,460
please be closer to me.

758
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,700
Yes.

759
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,740
I'll take good care of her.

760
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm relieved to have you.

761
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,380
Aunt,

762
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,100
so the king of the goose is coming.

763
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,500
I haven't seen him for years.

764
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,140
I don't know how he is now.

765
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,180
I was so happy

766
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,300
to see this girl.

767
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,100
Your Majesty.

768
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,180
Your Majesty.

769
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,340
I've got the answer.

770
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,500
Your Majesty, you're right.

771
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,300
Mrs. Zhu praised Mrs. Yulou so much.

772
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,740
There's a reason.

773
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,540
Mrs. Yulou

774
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,700
had a marriage with the Wei family.

775
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,020
The King of the Gose looks serious.

776
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,700
I didn't expect

777
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,940
there were so many old stories

778
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
to hide from you.

779
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,340
Don't take the risk.

780
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
Don't be angry.

781
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm not angry.

782
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,820
I'm just thinking

783
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,620
that the owner of Bianzhou, Chen Xiang,

784
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,740
is very weak.

785
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,820
He almost died a while ago.

786
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,500
He saved him with many famous doctors.

787
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,620
Mrs. Yulou

788
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,780
came to help the King now.

789
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,380
I feel something is wrong.

790
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,820
What do you mean?

791
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,660
It's just a coincidence.

792
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,060
The old generation knows this.

793
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,740
So Mrs. Yulou is dead.

794
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,820
She's so lucky.

795
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,620
She's not dead.

796
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,300
She's the most famous

797
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,820
because she's lucky.

798
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,100
I heard about many important things in Bianzhou.

799
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,820
Chen Xiang asked for her help.

800
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,340
Of course.

801
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,260
After all,

802
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,820
she's pregnant.

803
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,940
She said whoever marries her

804
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,820
will be the master of the Central Plains.

805
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,820
If so,

806
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,300
we can't go to the Central Plains

807
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,380
without marrying her.

808
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,940
I don't know what he's thinking.

809
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,020
He's not that important now.

810
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,140
He just wants to know

811
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,060
what Mrs. Yulou is going to do

812
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,420
when she comes here.

813
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,620
Who knows?

814
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,940
Mrs. Yulou

815
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,500
is so strange.

816
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:34,340
I wish to sing the smile of a fox

817
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

818
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,340
No matter how much I don't want to, I only miss you for this life

819
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:50,340
I won't forget you for the rest of my life

820
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:59,340
I wish to cross the sea of mountains to help you cross the wind and snow

821
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Waiting for the white hand to enter the bow

822
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:08,340
Jiangnan words are not lost in your eyebrows

823
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,340
Heart is sad

824
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,340
I wish to sing the smile of a fox

825
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Even if the wind and snow are behind me

826
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,340
No matter how much I don't want to, I only miss you for this life

827
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:33,340
I won't forget you for the rest of my life
