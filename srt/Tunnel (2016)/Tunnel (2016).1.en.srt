1
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,666
Take your time.

2
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,610
That's 97,000 won for a full tank.

3
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,073
-But I said to put in 30,000 won.
-What?

4
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,200
I told you before
I just want 30,000 won.

5
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,703
The old man's done it again.

6
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,788
I'm sorry, sir.

7
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,791
His hearing's gone bad.

8
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,337
If you're going to work here,
you need to wear hearing aids!

9
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,881
Give it here, I'll do it.

10
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,716
I said I'll do it!

11
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,720
It's okay. Charge the full amount.

12
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:05,852
Last time, he put in diesel
by mistake. Cost me 8 million won!

13
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,770
-I see.
-So sorry.

14
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,189
Thank you. Have a good day!

15
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,404
Take some water!

16
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,623
Yes, thank you.

17
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,261
We agreed on a deal last week.

18
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,224
But he keeps dragging it out.
I think he opened bidding somewhere else.

19
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>Tunnel ahead. Drive safely.</i>

20
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:50,188
I was going to buy you a handbag
after this deal went through.

21
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,522
Next time!

22
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,608
<i>Don't waste money on that.</i>

23
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,111
<i>What about Soo-jin's present?</i>
<i>Should we get a puppy?</i>

24
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,157
We can't raise a puppy
in that tiny house. Too much hair.

25
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,117
<i>Then, I don't know…</i>

26
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,203
<i>When will you be home?</i>

27
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,083
Need to stop at the car center.
The horn is dead.

28
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,127
<i>So when will you be home?</i>

29
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,422
Approximately 5:59 p.m.? I got a cake.

30
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,843
-I'll call you right back!
<i>-Okay.</i>

31
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,430
Hello, sir! Lee Jung-soo speaking.

32
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,683
No problem, I'm driving. Go ahead.

33
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,272
<i>I've said I needed ten rental cars,</i>
<i>but we're a bit short on cash.</i>

34
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,817
<i>So I'll take eight instead.</i>

35
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,237
<i>Can you also throw in</i>
<i>three of those kids' car seats?</i>

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,116
Sir, I always say
three's the magic number.

37
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,996
I'll slash the price and throw in extras.
It's all for the kids' safety.

38
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,039
<i>Great to hear!</i>

39
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,710
<i>Then I'll take eight cars.</i>
<i>Let's sign on Monday.</i>

40
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,545
Thank you, sir. Happy to help.

41
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,883
HADO TUNNEL
HAPPY AND SAFE NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION

42
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>So how much would it be?</i>

43
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,057
I'm not good with numbers.

44
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,312
After I pass this tunnel,
I'll stop the car and tell you.

45
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>Sure, call me.</i>

46
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,565
Talk to you in a moment. Thank you.

47
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,934
What the heck?

48
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,235
Hello!

49
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,862
<i>Emergency assistance.</i>

50
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,115
Hello!

51
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>This is 911, how may I help you?</i>

52
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,993
Yes…

53
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:42,456
I think a tunnel collapsed.
I'm stuck underneath.

54
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,916
It's--

55
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,086
<i>I can't hear you, sir.</i>
<i>Can you speak louder?</i>

56
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,629
Yes, sir.

57
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,756
<i>-Hello?</i>
-A tunnel collapsed!

58
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>-Hello?</i>
-A tunnel collapsed!

59
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,051
Tunnel!

60
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,555
<i>You mean a rockslide at a tunnel?</i>

61
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,891
No, a tunnel collapsed just now.

62
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:03,769
<i>It collapsed?</i>

63
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,771
Yes, come here quickly.

64
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,523
<i>Which tunnel do you mean?</i>

65
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,026
<i>Hello?</i>

66
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,278
-Hello?
<i>-Hello?</i>

67
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,239
<i>Sir, which tunnel are you talking about?</i>

68
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,451
<i>Hello? Sir, hello?</i>

69
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,244
This is Hado Tunnel. Hado Tunnel.

70
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,246
<i>-Hado Tunnel?</i>
-Yes.

71
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,498
<i>Hado Tunnel on Route 18?</i>

72
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,541
Yes, right!

73
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,754
It keeps collapsing in here. I'm trapped.

74
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,631
Hello?

75
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>This is the 911 main desk.</i>

76
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,554
<i>Did you mean a rockslide fell on your car?</i>

77
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:43,434
No, the tunnel collapsed.
I'm surrounded by rocks.

78
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,147
<i>How much did it collapse?</i>

79
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,273
A lot.

80
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,275
I'm buried.

81
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,363
Can you stop asking questions
and just come quickly?

82
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,364
Yes, yes.

83
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,659
<i>What is your name, sir?</i>

84
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,035
Lee Jung-soo.

85
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,870
Lee Jung-soo, from Kia Motors.

86
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,080
How long will it take?

87
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,539
<i>Mr. Lee Jung-soo…</i>

88
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,626
<i>With no traffic, it'll take five minutes.</i>

89
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,045
-Hello, sir?
<i>-Wait in a safe place.</i>

90
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,088
Hello?

91
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,596
Safe place, my ass…

92
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,677
If he'd only pumped 30,000 won
I'd have made it through, damn it.

93
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,836
<i>How does it look?</i>

94
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,798
<i>Hey, answer me.</i>

95
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,978
Safety in Korea has once again toppled.

96
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:57,234
This time, it's a tunnel. A tunnel open
for less than a month has fully collapsed.

97
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,197
As you can see, the mountain has caved in,

98
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,410
<i>with a transmission tower and other</i>
<i>structures bent over like sticks.</i>

99
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:11,123
<i>The tunnel's north entrance</i>
<i>was obliterated in the collapse,</i>

100
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:17,546
<i>while black soot has spewed</i>
<i>from the mouth of the south entrance.</i>

101
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,300
<i>With Hado New City yet to open,</i>

102
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,679
<i>traffic in the tunnel was light.</i>

103
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:31,685
<i>But a 911 call confirmed that at least</i>
<i>one person is trapped inside.</i>

104
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>The caller was a 38-year-old</i>
<i>car dealer from Hado City.</i>

105
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,698
<i>We repeat, the caller was Lee Jung-soo,</i>
<i>a 38-year-old male.</i>

106
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,117
BURIED PERSON IDENTIFIED

107
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,412
<i>He is currently trapped in the tunnel.</i>

108
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,789
<i>His condition is currently…</i>

109
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,411
WE'D LIKE TO HELP YOU
CONTACT US ASAP

110
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,412
I SAW THE TV REPORT…

111
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,413
IT'S NOT YOU, IS IT?

112
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,540
Yes, hello?

113
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,167
<i>Hello? Is this Mr. Lee Jung-soo?</i>

114
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,335
Yes.

115
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,964
<i>You are currently</i>
<i>under the tunnel, correct?</i>

116
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,175
-Yes, are you here?
<i>-Hey, connect us!</i>

117
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,389
<i>This is SNC reporter Jo Yang-chul!</i>
<i>Our call is being broadcast live.</i>

118
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,602
<i>You'll allow it, right? This broadcast</i>
<i>will help secure your rescue.</i>

119
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,231
EXCLUSIVE CALL WITH SURVIVOR

120
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,612
<i>Given the extent of the collapse,</i>

121
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,489
<i>it appears the rescue</i>
<i>could be a long-term operation.</i>

122
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>Do you have any food to tide you over?</i>

123
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,749
A long-term operation?
What are you talking about?

124
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,752
<i>Haven't you received</i>
<i>any information about your rescue?</i>

125
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:27,009
How long will it take?
You mean they can't come now?

126
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>It seems you haven't been informed</i>
<i>of the situation.</i>

127
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,640
<i>The south entrance's situation</i>
<i>is uncertain,</i>

128
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,977
<i>but the collapse has completely</i>
<i>buried the Seoul-bound entrance.</i>

129
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,898
<i>Mr. Lee, tell us your feelings now.</i>

130
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,319
Hey, where are they calling from?

131
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,904
They're in the van outside.

132
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,032
Then stop them!
What if his battery runs out?

133
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,665
Hey, you!

134
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,875
Hang up the phone now!

135
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,127
You're putting him in danger!

136
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,796
We're on air now.

137
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,673
We'll be done in a moment.

138
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,591
Damn bastards.

139
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,801
Yes, go ahead.

140
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,387
-Yes, then…
-Hang up the phone now!

141
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,014
-What are you doing now!
-Shit!

142
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,265
What are you doing?

143
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,185
<i>The phone was cut off.</i>
<i>We'll attempt to re-connect</i>…

144
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,063
-I can't believe this.
-What's wrong with you?

145
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,774
Making a scene during a live broadcast?

146
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,859
That was the evening news!

147
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,783
What's more important,
the broadcast or a human life?

148
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,868
What?

149
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,247
You can't answer that simple question?

150
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,960
If his battery dies because of you,

151
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,046
or if the isolation throws him
into a panic,

152
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,926
he could get an increased heart rate,
shortness of breath, constricted arteries!

153
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,221
If he goes into cardiac arrest,

154
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,349
then will you take responsibility?

155
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,812
-For Mr. Lee…
-What the hell!

156
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,564
This is his lifeline!

157
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,444
If you call again,

158
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,780
I'll report you under article 18,
clause 2 of the Media Ethics Law.

159
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,827
Please, don't call him.

160
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
And what's your car doing here?

161
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,044
Move it!

162
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,464
Hey, what is this car doing here?

163
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,383
No entry! Keep the cars out!

164
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,096
We can't even get our own cars in.
They've taken up all the space.

165
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,973
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

166
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,683
-Charge this for me.
-Yes, sir.

167
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,810
Nice work. Knowledge is power.

168
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,063
That shut them up, huh?

169
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,939
Media Ethics… What was that?

170
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,318
I just made that up.

171
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,903
It doesn't exist?

172
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,864
They didn't argue,
so I guess they don't know either.

173
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,449
Give me the operation manual.

174
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,706
A COLLAPSE IS CAUSED
BY NATURAL OR MAN-MADE…

175
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,249
There's no new one?

176
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,170
There's one that Americans use,
but it's still being translated.

177
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,759
Then translate this into English
and send it back.

178
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,845
Chief! A call from Lee Jung-soo.

179
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,307
-Lower the blinds, quick!
-Lower this too!

180
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,269
Mr. Lee? This is Task Force Chief
Kim Dae-kyung.

181
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>-Why don't you answer the phone?</i>
-What?

182
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,942
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>You said you'd rescue me soon.</i>

183
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,568
<i>You all contradict each other!</i>

184
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,570
Mr. Lee, calm down and listen…

185
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,322
<i>Do I sound calm?</i>

186
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,618
Just tell me what the situation is.
Be straight with me, damn it!

187
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,621
<i>Mr. Lee, I can't talk to you</i>
<i>if you're like this.</i>

188
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,541
Then who the hell can I talk to, asshole?

189
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,376
<i>Pass me to the guy in charge!</i>

190
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,421
Mr. Lee, I'm the guy in charge.

191
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,507
<i>You need to speak with me.</i>

192
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,051
Shit, then start talking.

193
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>Mr. Lee?</i>

194
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,473
<i>Before I talk,</i>
<i>you need to control your agitation.</i>

195
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,309
I'm not agitated. Tell me.

196
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,146
Do this, Mr. Lee.

197
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,065
Take a deep breath.

198
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,986
Do it after me, one deep breath.

199
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,162
I took a breath. Now tell me.

200
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,666
<i>Good. I'm Kim Dae-kyung,</i>
<i>in charge of the rescue.</i>

201
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,836
<i>Mr. Lee, how much phone battery</i>
<i>do you have left?</i>

202
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,258
78%, why do you ask?

203
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,136
<i>Yes, I'll be honest with you.</i>

204
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,472
<i>The situation is not so simple.</i>

205
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,224
<i>Of course we'll save you,</i>

206
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,643
but it might take some time.

207
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,563
The minister is coming.

208
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,606
-The minister?
-Yes.

209
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,195
Do you have anything to eat in the car?

210
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,906
Water, beverages, or some kind of food?

211
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,160
<i>Hello?</i>

212
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,828
Hello?

213
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,581
Mr. Lee? Hello?

214
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,753
Hello? Mr. Lee, get a grip
on yourself! Mr. Lee!

215
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,381
Do you have water? Answer me!

216
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,302
<i>Two bottles of water and a cake.</i>

217
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,638
What size are the bottles?

218
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,560
Small 500 ml bottles,
and a whipped cream cake.

219
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,022
The cake won't last long,
so eat it quickly.

220
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,108
The water is very important.

221
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:42,449
<i>Plan to drink it over seven days.</i>
<i>Divide it up in small portions.</i>

222
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,870
<i>And don't touch your lips to the bottle.</i>

223
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,539
<i>Bacteria can pollute the water. Okay?</i>

224
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,251
I have to stay here for a week?

225
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,254
We'll rescue you
before you drink all the water.

226
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,423
Mr. Lee, what did I say about the water?

227
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:05,347
Don't touch my lips to the bottle,
and drink it over a week.

228
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,307
Very good, that's perfect.

229
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,852
Mr. Lee, can you describe your location?

230
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,022
How far did you drive into the tunnel?

231
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,525
<i>This is very important information.</i>

232
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,446
Yes, I drove quite far in.

233
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,826
There's a ceiling fan in front of me.

234
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,286
<i>What? A fan?</i>

235
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,206
A fan fell on the car?
Hey, get the blueprints.

236
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,543
There's a fan above the car.
This is very important.

237
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,212
Put it there.

238
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,464
While we look… Just a sec.

239
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,010
We've got blueprints… It's ripped there.

240
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,511
<i>We can still check it.</i>

241
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,807
When you were driving,
did you see the exit?

242
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>-No, I didn't.</i>
-Very good.

243
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,938
Do you remember anything else?

244
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,608
After a curve, I drove in…

245
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,071
-I don't know.
-Okay, that's fine.

246
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,159
Mr. Lee, we'll talk at noon each day.

247
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,328
Let's hang up for today.

248
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,122
<i>-Turn off your phone.</i>
-What was your name again?

249
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,543
<i>I'm</i>… <i>Kim Dae-kyung.</i>

250
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,383
Tell me honestly.
Will you be able to rescue me?

251
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,888
We are the best rescue operations
in Korea.

252
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,598
You will be out soon.

253
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,100
<i>I'll see you when you come out.</i>

254
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,691
Jeez.

255
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,651
Pin it down.

256
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,070
You dope.

257
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,160
One, two, three, four, five…

258
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,247
He's under one of five fans. Okay.

259
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,429
WIFE

260
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
Se-hyun!

261
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,310
Se-hyun…

262
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,271
<i>Darling, are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>

263
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,942
I'm fine.

264
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,403
<i>How could this happen?</i>

265
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,784
I'm really okay. I'll be out soon.

266
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,495
They just told me I'll be out in a week.

267
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,704
Don't worry.

268
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,208
Don't cry. I'll be out soon.

269
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,922
They said to talk briefly
to save your battery.

270
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,929
What about Soo-jin? Does she know?

271
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,058
<i>I said you were busy at work.</i>
<i>Want to talk to her?</i>

272
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,145
Yes, put her on.

273
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,397
Just a sec.

274
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,443
Soo-jin!

275
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,237
<i>Daddy!</i>

276
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,405
Soo-jin!

277
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,493
I got you a cake,
but I got held up on the way home.

278
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,746
I can't make it, I'm sorry.

279
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,793
<i>Daddy, I'm going to Grandma's.</i>
<i>Meet us there.</i>

280
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,047
Bring the cake and a present, a puppy!

281
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,844
Okay, I'll get a puppy and come home.

282
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:35,348
<i>Really? Mommy, he's going to buy a puppy!</i>

283
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,685
<i>I'll leave her at Mom's and come down.</i>

284
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,520
No, just stay there.

285
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,275
<i>I'll see you.</i>

286
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,488
Okay.

287
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,243
Bye.

288
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,982
The tunnel is 1.9 km long,

289
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:53,903
and we believe
he's in one of these five locations.

290
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,531
The shallowest point is over 100 m.

291
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:01,286
Given the rocks, entering
through the south entrance might be best.

292
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,748
We'll send up the drones
to check it tomorrow.

293
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:11,129
Then let's proceed with the rescue
based on the specialists' guidance.

294
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:15,967
Let's give it our best,
as if it were our own family.

295
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:22,599
I'd also recommend halting
construction on Hado Tunnel No. 2.

296
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,392
There's another tunnel?

297
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:30,940
It's under construction nearby.
They're blasting the final section.

298
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,861
It's quite removed from here.
It shouldn't be affected.

299
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:39,282
It needs to be finished quickly
before Hado New City opens.

300
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,287
Then discuss it among yourselves.
Let's do our best.

301
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,007
-Can we fly them now?
-Yes.

302
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,718
Wait!

303
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,179
Need to put in my card.

304
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,558
God, they're obnoxious.

305
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,395
I'm ready. Go ahead!

306
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,147
Can you guys at the front sit down?

307
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,941
-Sit, please!
-Just a little!

308
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,569
You're blocking our view. Thank you.

309
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,655
-Let's go.
-Okay.

310
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,041
Your drones can take off now.

311
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,000
Go!

312
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,839
The press drones
mustn't collide with ours.

313
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,549
Keep a safe distance.

314
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,523
-This is ridiculous.
-Okay.

315
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,291
Huh?

316
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,842
What's going on?

317
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,219
Did it lose the signal?

318
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,513
It's not that far from here.

319
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,103
Usually the range is 5 km,

320
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,981
but if something blocks
the radio waves, it can shorten.

321
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,859
There's so much iron ore here.

322
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,781
Then, is there a cable-operated drone?

323
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,241
There's a robot for rail tracks,

324
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,286
but for this length,
we need a custom model.

325
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,538
Send it by delivery bike.

326
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,540
Or should we go? Where's the factory?

327
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,083
Ontario City. In the US.

328
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,128
Dear God.

Oh, shit.

334
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,409
Hey, you stay here.

335
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,079
-You'll be okay on your own?
-Yes.

336
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,010
It's completely collapsed.

337
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,740
Your wife's on the phone.

338
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,913
Tell her I'll call back.
Don't honk the horn again, okay?

339
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,456
Sorry.

340
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,707
That dumbass…

341
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,588
Has he gone crazy?

342
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,757
What?

343
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,677
Sorry, I pressed it by mistake. So sorry.

344
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,942
Chief!

345
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,903
It's Lee Jung-soo!

346
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,994
Yes, Mr. Lee?

347
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,373
-Did somebody come nearby?
<i>-What?</i>

348
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,334
I think I heard a car horn.
It honked twice.

349
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,752
<i>Really?</i>

350
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,340
-I can hear it!
<i>-That's…</i>

351
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,550
Me, it's me.

352
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,552
Does he hear this?

353
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,768
I just heard it five times now.

354
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,894
<i>Yes, right.</i>

355
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,065
Mr. Lee, we might meet
sooner than expected.

356
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,609
<i>Really? Thank you!</i>

357
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,032
Mr. Lee! Lie down as low as you can!

358
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,123
Hold tight!

359
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,247
What's going on?

360
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,457
HAPPY AND SAFE NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION

361
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,877
Phone!

362
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,629
Chief!

363
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,008
-Chief, are you okay?
-Get a phone!

364
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,456
Hello?

365
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,752
Mr. Lee, do you hear me? Can you hear?

366
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,015
Yes, I can.

367
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,274
<i>Are you all right?</i>

368
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,527
It caved in a little bit, but I'm okay.

369
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,156
The tunnel collapsed a bit more
by the entrance.

370
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,036
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

371
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,212
It says number three on the fan here.

372
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,923
<i>Number three</i>…

373
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,299
But… Shit.

374
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,093
<i>-Your wife…</i>
-What?

375
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,762
<i>Your wife is here.</i>

376
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,931
<i>Want to talk to her?</i>

377
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,350
Put her on, please.

378
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,312
<i>Honey, are you okay?</i>

379
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,982
Did you eat breakfast?

380
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,735
You ask me that now?

381
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,528
<i>I'm okay.</i>

382
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:24,575
I'll call you back soon.
Have some breakfast.

383
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,410
Yesterday at 8:30 a.m.,

384
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:11,497
our rescue team determined
Lee's precise location.

385
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,211
We are now drilling towards Lee,
who is 180 m underground.

386
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:28,306
We also plan to enter the south entrance.

387
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,849
TWO TRACK
1. VERTICAL EXCAVATION

388
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,642
2. HORIZONTAL EXCAVATION

389
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:37,815
With our president's order
to use all of the nation's power,

390
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:43,321
our government is exerting its strength

391
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,282
to rescue Lee as soon as possible.

392
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,748
Minister, this is Lee's wife.

393
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,043
Oh, gosh.

394
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,922
Please help us.

395
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,175
-Don't worry.
-Minister, please face this way.

396
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,970
-Photographs.
-Minister, please look here.

397
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,355
How do you do?

398
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,732
It's not done yet.

399
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,776
One, two, three!

400
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,863
3 DAYS AFTER COLLAPSE

401
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,413
Eight, seven, six,

402
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,709
five, four, three, two, one…

403
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,835
Ta-da!

404
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,590
Ten, nine, eight…

405
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,040
KIA MOTORS
LEE JUNG-SOO

406
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,966
MOISTURE ABSORBER
DO NOT EAT

407
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,442
Then…

408
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,202
WASHER FLUID

409
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,801
SPIDER HANDS

410
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,376
Who is it?

411
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,443
You little mutt!

412
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,117
What are you doing there?

413
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,623
Hello.

414
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,212
Hello?

415
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,715
Is there anyone there?

416
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,343
I'm here, in the car.

417
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,765
Are you hurt?

418
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,268
I'm stuck.

419
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,604
I can't move. Help me.

420
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,688
Just a minute.

421
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,651
Mister!

422
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,696
Mister, are you there? Please don't go.

423
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,824
I'm not going. I can't go anywhere.

424
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,909
THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON HERE

425
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,746
I'll come to you, wait.

426
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,917
Mister, you're coming?

427
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,253
Yes, I'm coming. Just wait a minute.

428
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,769
What's wrong?

429
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,898
It's okay, I'm coming.

430
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,691
It's okay, nothing's wrong.

431
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,402
No, I'm fine now.

432
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,322
I'm on my way.

433
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,991
That hurts.

434
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,918
I'm here.

435
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,965
You punk.

436
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,804
Here you are.

437
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,105
I…

438
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,275
I can't move.

439
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,740
-I'll come inside.
-Okay.

440
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,668
Move over, you.

441
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,886
I'll try lifting the rock.

442
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,517
Sorry for dawdling.

443
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,285
Wait a second.

444
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,217
It won't budge.

445
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,641
Are you okay?

446
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,851
Mister, the light.

447
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,187
-The light.
-Sorry.

448
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,690
I'm okay.

449
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,985
But I'm feeling pain in my side.

450
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,030
Your side? Shall I pull back your chair?

451
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,032
It won't move, I think.

452
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,584
How long have we been here?

453
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:24,007
It's been two days and seven hours.

454
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,011
What will happen to us?

455
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,557
Will we die?

456
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:38,105
No, the entire country
is mobilizing to save us.

457
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,275
-Really?
-Of course.

458
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,902
Thank God.

459
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,240
When can we get out?

460
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,576
Well…

461
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:59,626
I talked with them on the phone.
They said soon, just a few days.

462
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,840
But he's not hurt at all.

463
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,175
-Tengie isn't hurt?
-No, he looks good.

464
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,885
That's a relief.

465
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,762
What's this collar?

466
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,181
An anti-bark collar.

467
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,474
Tengie.

468
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,145
Tengie.

469
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,273
Tengie, come here. Tengie.

470
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,201
I'm really sorry,

471
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,412
but…

472
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,873
do you have any water?

473
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,876
Water?

474
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,213
It's in my car. I'll get some.

475
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,329
How's that?

476
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,917
Just… a little more.

477
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:30,759
Drinking too much at once isn't good,

478
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,012
so just wet your throat.

479
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,685
That's good.

480
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,273
-Mister.
-Yes?

481
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,736
Can you give Tengie a little too?

482
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:56,201
Just pour some in your hand.

483
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,453
Yes, of course.

484
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:06,086
Tengie, come here. He'll give you water.

485
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,463
Wait! Not this way!

486
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,675
Go around. This way, Tengie.

487
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,968
That's right.

488
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:16,847
Here.

489
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,732
-Mister?
-Good doggie.

490
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:32,070
Could you look for my phone?

491
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,238
Your phone?

492
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,158
It's…

493
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,122
It's not working. It's off.

494
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,670
I'm really sorry.

495
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,175
But can I use your phone?

496
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,594
Just one call.

497
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,721
Yeah, sure.

498
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,477
I'll hold it for you.

499
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,653
Mom, it's me. Mi-na.

500
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,247
Mom…

501
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:32,589
A tunnel collapsed and I'm trapped.

502
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,257
Yes.

503
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:48,188
No, I'm not alone. A man is with me.

504
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,148
Yes, don't worry.

505
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:54,861
He said we can get out in a few days.

506
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,328
I miss you, Mom.

507
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:14,464
But Mom, I can't talk long.
I need to save the battery.

508
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:22,514
And please call my company

509
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,933
and explain everything.

510
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,561
Don't cry, Mom.

511
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,859
Yes, I'm okay.

512
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,697
Mister, we'll be out by next week?

513
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,948
Yes, sure.

514
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:43,869
Mom, I'll be out next week.

515
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:49,374
So tell them I can attend

516
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,753
the workshop for new hires.

517
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,637
Oh, right, and…

518
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:09,352
Your car is wrecked, I'm sorry.

519
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:13,899
Yes, okay.

520
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,193
I'll call again.

521
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,279
Okay.

522
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,408
-Mister?
-Yes?

523
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,286
-My mom wants to talk to you.
-What?

524
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,914
Me?

525
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,924
Yes, I'm Lee Jung-soo
of Kia Motors. Hello.

526
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,760
Yes…

527
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:46,306
I'll take good care of Mi-na

528
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,017
and see her out safely, don't worry.

529
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:54,189
Yes, she drank water. She drank a lot.

530
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,483
Yes…

531
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,818
Thank you, yes…

532
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:10,038
Mi-na, I brought these socks
for you to wear.

533
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,833
But you're crying.
I'll wipe your face a bit.

534
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,834
Yes.

535
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,798
It doesn't hurt? Does this cut hurt?

536
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:20,924
No, it's fine.

537
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,107
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

538
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,653
I reserved a motel room
and checked you in.

539
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:42,988
Thank you.

540
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:47,075
We're supposed to cover this,
but the payment takes time.

541
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:50,578
If you save your receipts,
we'll process them later.

542
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,705
Okay.

543
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,915

My job?

550
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,847
Kia car dealer, Hado Branch.

551
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,058
Got it!

Classical? Wow, classical.

554
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,944
Not bad. Calms the nerves, classical.

555
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,946
Do you like classical, Mi-na?

556
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,492
My first time listening since high school.

557
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,588
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

558
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,051
Mister, I'll sleep for a while.

559
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,972
Then I'll be in my car.
If you need anything, call me.

560
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,224
And this…

561
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,270
The button is here.

562
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,898
Keep it turned off. Save the battery.

563
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,777
I'll help you light your way back.

564
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,571
Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

565
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,625
Mi-na, the light please.

566
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,503
Sorry. Tengie is biting it.

567
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,255
Tengie, stop!

568
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,801
That dirty dog!

569
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,724
I'm home.

570
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,817
Daddy's coming soon.

571
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,570
Daddy's coming soon.

572
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,214
We'll eat it together.

573
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,058
What?

574
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,192
My cake! You damn dog!

575
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,777
Son of a bitch! What the hell?

576
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,281
You damn dog! Damn you!

577
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,537
This cake…

578
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:25,210
Soo-jin gave me this…
Son of a bitch! Asshole!

579
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,713
What's wrong, mister?

580
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,218
Nothing. It was a dream.

581
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,053
A dream.

582
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:48,983
Have some eggs.

583
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,694
You don't need to do that.

584
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,030
-Eat it while it's hot.
-Take a rest.

585
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,199
You're working to save my husband.

586
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,451
-Thanks so much.
-It's the least I can do.

587
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,452
Thank you.

588
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,246
Enjoy!

589
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,586
Rain's really coming down.

590
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,432
-Leave it, I'll get you--
-It's okay!

591
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,600
It's okay.

592
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,561
It's all right.

593
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,145
It's all right.

594
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:39,993
Mister…

595
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,167
Mister, over here!

596
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,297
Yes!

597
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:02,682
Will it be long before they come?

598
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,810
They'll be here soon. Wait just a bit.

599
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,687
They promised they'd come.

600
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,524
Are you okay?

601
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:17,655
My side hurts so much.

602
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,243
And it's hard to breathe.

603
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:25,872
Try…

604
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,293
Try bearing it a bit longer. I'll go call.

605
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,003
Mister.

606
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:38,301
I'm sorry, but do you have water?

607
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:47,477
I'm sorry. I drank it all, didn't I?

608
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,483
No, it's okay. I'll bring you some.

609
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,485
Wait a minute.

610
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,353
Luckily, we have water. I have it here.

611
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,856
Tengie, not today.

612
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,067
You understand?

613
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:43,908
Mi-na.

614
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:47,787
Mi-na?

615
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,717
Mi-na?

616
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,935
You're scaring me.

617
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,446
Mi-na, I brought water.

618
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,079
Mi-na?

619
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,961
Wait. I'll move this for you.

620
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,539
Mi-na, I'm sorry.

621
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,754

Who would bother to do it properly?

629
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,364
Who in Korea follows the field manual?

630
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,034
This was just bad luck, don't you think?

631
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,913
You said you'd come
before the water ran out.

632
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,917
<i>I'm… sorry.</i>

633

We can definitely save you.

Yes.

-It comes out sterile, so…
-Have you ever tried it?

639
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,408

Get out of here.

642
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,431
What's that?

643
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,490
Where did you get that?

644
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,547
Since you ate my cake last time,

645
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,467
two for me and one for you.

646
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,635
And my nose is bigger than yours,

647
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:41,891
so four for me and two for you.

648
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,397
Got it? Okay, Tengie.

649
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,484
Eat up. Eat.

650
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,862
It's okay, don't be shy.

651
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,781
Eat your fill.

652
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,621
I guess dogs don't like salt.

653
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,212
Look over there.

654
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,174
Look over there. Hey!

655
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:16,884
It's here!

656
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,348
It's here!

657
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,147
You're not getting in here.

658
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,235
Let's take it off.

659
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,279
Wow, look at this…

660
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:42,243
Bark.

661
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,584
You punk!

662
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,550
Stay. He won't bark.

663
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,136
Does this really work?

664
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,597
Woof!

665
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:46,343
Can't you guys hide your poop,
like cats do?

666
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,471
Who's gonna clean up your mess?

667
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,973
Who? Huh?

668
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,919
I'm not gonna drink yours. Never.

669
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,051
How are things going?
How much did you dig?

670
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:30,429
The ground is hard so we're a bit late,

671
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,598
but we should reach you in ten days.

672
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,683
<i>At the tunnel entrance,</i>

673
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,811
<i>we did safety reinforcement work</i>
<i>and started excavating today.</i>

674
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:44,485
Twenty-two, 23, 24…

675
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:48,822
Twenty-four…

676
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:51,784
Ten days!

677
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,205
Mr. Lee, I…

678
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,042
drank urine.

679
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:04,963
But why did you do that?

680
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:08,717
<i>I felt bad telling you to do</i>
<i>something I never did.</i>

681
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,429
Oh, and don't drink it
as soon as it comes out.

682
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,725
Let it cool, if possible.

683
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,563
You're a tremendous help, thanks.

684
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,494
You want a sip?

685
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,790
Tengie.

686
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,585
It's orange juice.

687
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,589
My body makes orange juice.

688
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,716
Amazing, huh?

689
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:40,285
<i>Honey!</i>

690
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,622
I drank water! I'm drinking water!

691
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,250
<i>It tastes so sweet!</i>

692
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:51,463
<i>I'm totally fine now,</i>
<i>so make sure you eat.</i>

693
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,091
-Okay…
<i>-Talk to you later. Bye.</i>

694
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,092
Okay.

695
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,889
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

696
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,017
Are you okay?

697
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:08,021
I heard you drank urine.

698
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:15,445
-How much did you have?
-So he told you everything.

699
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:19,908
Well, a paper cup…

700
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:26,540
Not this size. Closer to his cup there.

701
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,584
Want some?

702
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,544
You have it.

01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,056
This is a piece of the tunnel.
It was drilled this morning.

712
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,975
If our team works through the night,

713
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,937
we'll reach the tunnel floor by tomorrow.

714
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,899
Lee Jung-soo will be out soon!

715
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,152
<i>Thank you.</i>

716
01:17:42,115 --> 01:17:44,826
D-1
ONE DAY BEFORE RESCUE

717
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,175
I'LL BRING DADDY HOME TOMORROW

718
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,468
AND THE PUPPY?

719
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,430
Wake up!

720
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,601
It's time to get ready.

721
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,064
I dozed off. So tired.

722
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,405
Too bad.

723
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:27,160
Almost a new Korean record.
The department store in 1994 was 17 days.

724
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,580
Then would you like to set a new record?

725
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,919
Out of the way. Don't block the path!

726
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:37,212
What the…

727
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,715
What's the world record, anyway?

728
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:41,967
No idea.

729
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:43,760
<i>Look up at the ceiling.</i>

730
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,137
17 DAYS AFTER COLLAPSE

731
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,264
If something's about to fall, jump aside.

732
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:51,351
<i>It's only 60 cm wide,</i>
<i>so you won't need to move far.</i>

733
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,645
Okay, thank you. See you soon.

734
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,820
Guess it will come out here.

735
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,451
Let's get out of here.

736
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,165
Up.

737
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:15,792
Stop!

738
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:23,800
We've got a fan blade and asphalt.

739
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:25,761
That means we've touched bottom, right?

740
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:28,013
Right. We reached bottom.

741
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,724
-What are you talking about?
-We've got a piece of fan…

742
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:31,683
Get the blueprints!

743
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,148
Something's not right.

744
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,485
Go check it out.

745
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:45,781
Mr. Lee, you didn't see the drill?

746
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,408
No, I didn't.

747
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:50,660
<i>-The two fans are still there?</i>
-Yes, why?

748
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,167
I'll check something and call you back.

749
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,335
Here it is.

750
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,379
What's this?

751
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,716
It was recorded
during the tunnel's opening.

752
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,056
-How many fans in total?
-Seven.

753
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,018
One's missing.

754
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:16,937
What is missing?

755
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,563
It's only six.

756
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:21,691
Shit.

757
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,069
What is this rubbish?

758
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,072
Hey, rewind it.

759
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,908
One, two, three,

760
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,745
four, five, six…

761
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,587
It said seven, so we drilled at the third.

762
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,798
When actually…

763
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,926
The blueprint is wrong?

764
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,472
Are you kidding me?

765
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:55,058
It can't be.

766
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,434
Captain!

767
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:01,690
The engineer says they installed 12 fans

768
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,942
in two rows at six locations.

769
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,950
Looks like they got the wrong place.

770
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,286
-Really?
-Yes.

771
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,582
The last 17 days were wasted?

772
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:21,918
Wow…

773
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:38,268
-It's Lee Jung-soo's wife.
-His wife.

774
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,938
Take a shot.

775
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,283
DRILLING POINT

776
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,535
-Then how far away is he?
-About 150 m.

777
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,370
We can't get there from here.

778
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,003
Then we have to start again from scratch?

779
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,219
When are you coming down?

780
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,597
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

781
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:17,682
What?

782
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,352
<i>We dug in the wrong place.</i>

783
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,857
What are you talking about?

784
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,735
We confused the location…

785
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,405
and dug somewhere else.

786
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,663
What… Somewhere else?

787
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,041
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

788
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:54,427
Then what's going to happen to me?

789
01:22:55,345 --> 01:23:01,101
<i>We'll restart the excavation</i>
<i>by the entrance, and…</i>

790
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:02,852
And?

791
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:07,023
<i>We'll drill again from above…</i>

792
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,442
Starting over?

793
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,362
<i>We'll work as fast as we can.</i>

794
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,566
<i>Honey, are you okay?</i>

795
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:51,192
<i>Honey.</i>

796
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,988
What's wrong?

797
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:01,161
I can't breathe.

798
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:05,331
<i>Try to calm down. I'll put a doctor on.</i>

799
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:06,958
Help me, here!

800
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,835
Something's wrong with him!

801
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:12,338
No! My battery's run out.

802
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,799
This is the last time, Se-hyun.

803
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,302
My battery's run out.

804
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:20,889
Let me talk to Soo-jin. Hurry, get her.

805
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,851
Soo-jin's not here.
Honey! Get a hold of yourself.

806
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:28,271
I can't stay here anymore. I can't do it.

807
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,356
<i>-Jung-soo!</i>
-I can't do it.

808
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,193
<i>Get a hold of yourself!</i>
<i>You need to try, okay?</i>

809
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,028
Why do I have to do it?

810
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,531
I can't take it anymore.

811
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,367
Hello?

812
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,119
Talk to me, honey.

813
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:44,079
Please…

814
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:50,627
Look after Soo-jin.
And take care of yourself.

815
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,089
What are you saying?

816
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,968
Se-hyun, I'm sorry. I can't go on.

817
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,054
I can't…

818
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,694
Fine, you do that.

819
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,532
Go on and die.

820
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,117
Die!

821
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:26,204
But…

822
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:31,084
If you let yourself die,
Soo-jin and I will die, too!

823
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:35,296
If you go, we're all going! Understand?

824
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,382
This isn't just a threat.

825
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:40,510
<i>Or if you can,</i>

826
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,888
<i>just live for our sake.</i>

827
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:48,226
Don't be weak
and say you'll die, just live.

828
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,147
Honey, please hang on. Please!

829
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:55,668
Ma'am!

830
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:59,255
-Call a doctor!
-Hurry up!

831
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,049
Get a stretcher!

832
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:13,770
IN SUPPORT OF LEE JUNG-SOO

833
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:20,902
We asked for a snowplow
ages ago. Why haven't you answered?

834
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:24,530
<i>The city streets are a mess.</i>
<i>We have no snowplow to send.</i>

835
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:26,574
This should be your first priority!

836
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,786
We've had 50 accidents
here in just two days.

837
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,371
Some people died yesterday.

838
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,415
We're desperate here, too.

839
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:38,461
And I'm sorry to say this, but…

840
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:40,964
<i>it's only one person there.</i>

841
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:46,177
That one person! He is still alive!

842
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,012
You know how long he's waited?

843
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,101
Please, I beg you.

844
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,938
Send us one snowplow!

845
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:12,704
<i>Could Lee Jung-soo still be alive?</i>

846
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,831
23 DAYS AFTER COLLAPSE

847
01:28:14,914 --> 01:28:16,749
The Chilean miners lasted 69 days,

848
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:20,295
but that was 33 people
living together with a food supply.

849
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:25,091
The record for someone
alone with no food is 19 days.

850
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:31,723
Extreme anxiety, cold
and bodily injury make it even harder.

851
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,183
So, you think it's unlikely?

852
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,686
Well, every situation has its variables,

853
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:39,105
so I can't say anything conclusive.

854
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:40,356
I see…

855
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,693
Today is Lee Jung-soo's twenty-third day
under the tunnel.

856
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:46,988
It's been a week since contact was lost.

857
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:51,784
With no idea of what Lee has been through,

858
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:56,414
can any of us really judge?
It's something to consider.

859
01:28:56,497 --> 01:28:59,751
We prefer to believe in hope
over statistics.

860
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:27,028
<i>We'll read out a letter</i>
<i>to Lee Jung-soo from his wife.</i>

861
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:30,990
<i>These days Soo-jin says life is hard.</i>

862
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,743
<i>To say such things at her age!</i>

863
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,163
<i>She says she hates preschool.</i>

864
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:40,041
<i>They're learning addition.</i>
<i>She doesn't like it.</i>

865
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,960
<i>Guess she's not good</i>
<i>with numbers, like you.</i>

866
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:47,131
<i>Out of the blue today, she said</i>
<i>she was most comfortable</i>

867
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,009
<i>when she was a baby in my stomach.</i>

868
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,553
<i>So I told her to go back in.</i>

869
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,890
<i>She said she wanted to,</i>
<i>but she's too big now.</i>

870
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,435
<i>For Soo-jin, who hates addition…</i>

871
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:16,619
<i>…we've prepared a pop song.</i>

872
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:21,582
<i>We ask our classical music lovers</i>
<i>for their understanding.</i>

873
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,210
<i>This is for Lee Jung-soo.</i>

874
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:47,859
Then, how will the excavation proceed?

875
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:53,364
Well, we're 200 m from his location,

876
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:57,827
so at 15 m per day,
we'll reach him in two weeks.

877
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:01,330
After failing the first excavation…

878
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:02,999
Why did they call us here?

879
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,543
What the heck are they doing?

880
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:08,921
Construction on Tunnel No. 2
has been halted for 25 days.

881
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:13,759
With losses of 1.5 billion won a day,
that's 50 billion to date.

882
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,471
Is it not possible
to restart construction?

883
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:20,141
Since explosives are required,

884
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,686
it could very well put
Lee Jung-soo in danger.

885
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,065
Then how long do we have to wait?

886
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:31,736
We've kept our silence until now,

887
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:35,406
but remember when construction
stopped because of a salamander?

888
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:38,034
You know how much that cost
the nation's economy?

889
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,703
Because of a few salamanders?

890
01:31:40,786 --> 01:31:41,829
Excuse me.

891
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:45,124
Excuse me.

892
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:50,504
Lee Jung-soo is a human, not a salamander.

893
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:56,761
It's not an amphibian
under the tunnel, but a human.

894
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:58,262
A human.

895
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:03,059
Yes, but I never claimed otherwise.

896
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:08,147
Perhaps, but you seem to keep forgetting.

897
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:12,485
There's a human trapped under there.

898
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,977
I'll do it.

899
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,651
How long do we have to do this?

900
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:40,156
You said it. All to pull out a dead body.

901
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:43,784
Hey, how can you say that?

902
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,579
Everyone says there's no hope.

903
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:52,793
We're doing this for his family,
but even you feel the same.

904
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:57,840
No, I don't. Don't say that again, okay?

905
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:01,385
-Go ahead.
-Yes, yes…

906
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,820
Chief!

907
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:35,461
Minister, someone died at the rescue site.

908
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,133
I told you
something like this would happen.

909
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:19,940
Mom, is it hard
looking after Soo-jin? Sorry…

910
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:23,027
<i>You take care of yourself.</i>

911
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:25,696
<i>Are you eating enough?</i>

912
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:27,072
Yes, I am.

913
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:29,158
Soo-jin didn't go to preschool?

914
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:30,701
<i>No.</i>

915
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:33,454
Why not?

916
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:36,916
<i>Well…</i>

917
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:38,959
What is it?

918
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:44,965
<i>The kids must've heard their moms talking,</i>

919
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:47,092
<i>and they teased Soo-jin.</i>

920
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:49,929
What did they say?

921
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:55,100
<i>That because of her dad, someone died.</i>

922
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:01,357
<i>I couldn't help but speak</i>
<i>my mind to their moms.</i>

923
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:06,237
Mom, don't send her there.
Wait until I'm back.

924
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:21,794
My son died because of you!

925
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,881
Because of you! My son died…

926
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:32,054
My healthy son died trying
to get your husband's corpse.

927
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:38,102
I'm so sorry.

928
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:41,438
I'm so sorry.

929
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:10,968
64% SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION ON TUNNEL 2

930
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:21,145
AGREEMENT FORM TO RESUME CONSTRUCTION

931
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:24,356
I understand your situation.

932
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:31,530
But as time passes,
it gets harder for everyone.

933
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:36,619
The people say we should stop. Over 65%.

934
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,956
Everyone is exhausted.

935
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:48,839
If you refuse to budge
and someone else gets hurt, what then?

936
01:38:54,136 --> 01:38:56,347
It's time to make a decision.

937
01:38:57,598 --> 01:38:58,807
But tell me.

938
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:01,644
Yes, go ahead.

939
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:15,240
What if my husband is still alive?

940
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,123
Wouldn't you feel sorry?

941
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:46,438
EMERGENCY BELL SYSTEM

942
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:50,442
Stop the operation!

943
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:39,742
<i>Honey.</i>

944
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,619
<i>Are you listening?</i>

945
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:46,582
<i>It's Se-hyun.</i>

946
01:40:56,008 --> 01:40:58,552
I'm not sure if you're listening.

947
01:41:05,684 --> 01:41:07,478
<i>It's cold there, right?</i>

948
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,409
And you're hungry?

949
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:34,338
I signed a form today.

950
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:39,885
Tunnel No. 2, nearby there…

951
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:44,890
I agreed to let them restart construction.

952
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:56,610
Which means they'll stop
the operation to rescue you.

953
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:09,373
<i>They'll close it up.</i>
<i>The rescue's finished.</i>

954
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,918
<i>Don't wait…</i>

955
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:17,756
<i>No one's coming.</i>

956
01:42:19,341 --> 01:42:22,511
<i>I'm so sorry to say this.</i>

957
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,639
<i>I'm so scared to say it.</i>

958
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:30,185
Just in case…

959
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:39,027
Just in case
you're waiting without knowing…

960
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:44,616
that you might keep waiting for us.

961
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:51,415
I'm sorry, honey.

962
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:00,632
<i>But are you alive?</i>

963
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:09,349
Everyone else says you're not alive.

964
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,311
That you're dead.

965
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,526
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

966
01:43:29,661 --> 01:43:32,080
But what if you're listening?

967
01:43:33,248 --> 01:43:34,791
I'm so sorry.

968
01:43:35,417 --> 01:43:37,127
I'm sorry, honey.

969
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,505
Jung-soo, honey…

970
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:42,841
I'm so sorry…

971
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,635
Sorry.

972
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,888
No…

973
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:03,779
I'm alive…

974
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:09,368
I'm still alive…

975
01:44:13,455 --> 01:44:14,581
Oh, God…

976
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:51,678
<i>Construction of Hado Tunnel No. 2,</i>
<i>halted for the rescue operation,</i>

977
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:53,597
<i>resumes today.</i>

978
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:59,352
<i>Once completed, it will reduce</i>
<i>the drive to Seoul by 40 minutes…</i>

979
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:03,231
Chief, if you do this, I'll be fired!

980
01:46:03,315 --> 01:46:06,568
It's been so long since we drilled this,

981
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:09,529
the passage could be warped,
or there could be a crack.

982
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:13,325
It's dangerous, okay?
You don't need to do this!

983
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:16,578
I told him to wait.

984
01:46:17,412 --> 01:46:20,373
Leaving him there is too cruel.

985
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:26,088
I'll just check whether he's alive or not.

986
01:46:28,131 --> 01:46:29,091
Lower me down.

987
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:36,765
Maintain radio contact
and come up if there's any trouble.

988
01:46:36,848 --> 01:46:37,808
Okay.

989
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:08,171
<i>Almost there.</i>

990
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,341
<i>There'll be a bump, so hang on tight.</i>

991
01:47:11,424 --> 01:47:12,884
Damn, tell me that sooner.

992
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:04,204
Hey, is someone down there?

993
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:07,082
Yes, he just needed to check some--

994
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:09,459
Get him out quick!
They're starting to blast!

995
01:49:22,764 --> 01:49:24,474
<i>Chief!</i>

996
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:31,523
Don't radio me now.
You're causing interference.

997
01:49:32,607 --> 01:49:35,235
<i>You need to come up now.</i>

998
01:49:35,318 --> 01:49:37,570
A little longer, just five minutes!

999
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:39,614
<i>Close the cover, you're coming up.</i>

1000
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,324
Wait!

1001
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,493
Mr. Lee!

1002
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,871
Mr. Lee!

1003
01:49:47,622 --> 01:49:48,957
Mr. Lee!

1004
01:49:53,837 --> 01:49:55,255
Everyone's out!

1005
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:04,342
Damn it.

1006
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:09,180
You know how expensive this is?

1007
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:11,891
-There are only a few in Korea!
-Damn!

1008
01:52:13,726 --> 01:52:15,854
Cut it out, will you?

1009
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,858
Then treat the equipment with care.

1010
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:28,324
-Wait!
-What?

1011
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:33,246
Stop everything!

1012
01:52:33,329 --> 01:52:35,165
Nobody move! Stop everything!

1013
01:52:35,248 --> 01:52:38,835
Don't move up there! Don't move! Stop!

1014
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:52,265
I hear him.

1015
01:53:35,558 --> 01:53:37,143
HQ!

1016
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:39,604
Stop the detonation!

1017
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:43,399
Lee Jung-soo is alive in the tunnel!

1018
01:53:45,026 --> 01:53:46,319
Lee Jung-soo is alive!

1019
01:53:46,402 --> 01:53:49,906
<i>Stop the detonation! He's alive!</i>

1020
01:54:50,258 --> 01:54:53,428
35 DAYS AFTER COLLAPSE

1021
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:29,464
Chief! There.

1022
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:18,262
There he is!

1023
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:20,390
Out of the way!

1024
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:23,768
How do you feel now?

1025
01:56:28,398 --> 01:56:29,941
Clear a path!

1026
01:56:30,566 --> 01:56:31,818
Step aside!

1027
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:34,904
Give us a path!

1028
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,171
I'm sorry.

1029
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,263
Clear a path!

1030
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:12,775
Step aside!

1031
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,171
Why aren't the blades turning?

1032
01:57:33,838 --> 01:57:36,299
-They said to wait.
-Who? Why?

1033
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:37,425
Just a minute!

1034
01:57:37,508 --> 01:57:41,846
The minister is almost here.
Wait a moment and fly with her.

1035
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:43,514
Have you gone mad?

1036
01:57:44,015 --> 01:57:45,975
I cleared it with HQ.

1037
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,394
She's arrived.

1038
01:57:50,938 --> 01:57:53,775
-Minister, please say a few words.
-Please.

1039
01:58:01,532 --> 01:58:02,867
Wait!

1040
01:58:03,284 --> 01:58:06,079
Lee Jung-soo just said something!

1041
01:58:06,162 --> 01:58:09,165
What were his first words to the world?

1042
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:11,084
Please tell us!

1043
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:15,797
We can't hear, please say it loudly!

1044
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:17,840
Yes, uh…

1045
01:58:17,924 --> 01:58:20,051
Please speak up!

1046
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:24,472
All of you assholes, fuck off!

1047
01:58:32,563 --> 01:58:34,774
Those were his exact words.

1048
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:41,405
Okay, let's go.

1049
01:58:43,491 --> 01:58:45,159
Let's lift it. One, two, three.

1050
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:53,626
Who?

1051
01:58:54,252 --> 01:58:55,169
Me?

1052
01:58:55,795 --> 01:58:56,712
Why?

1053
01:59:37,753 --> 01:59:41,424
Lee Jung-soo's safe return after 35 days

1054
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:45,970
is all the more meaningful
for setting a world record.

1055
01:59:46,053 --> 01:59:51,058
But if there was a hole
in the rescue operation…

1056
01:59:51,142 --> 01:59:54,228
Expressing his deep emotion to the nation,

1057
01:59:54,312 --> 01:59:59,025
Lee's thumbs-up is a show of thanks
to the government and the nation.

1058
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:03,654
<i>This was a day that confirmed the saying</i>

1059
02:00:04,822 --> 02:00:08,534
<i>that the weight of a human life</i>
<i>outweighs the earth.</i>

1060
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:14,123
<i>A human life is more valuable</i>
<i>than anything…</i>

1061
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:17,084
You can't park your car here.

1062
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:18,544
Move the car!

1063
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:23,049
"I used profanity…

1064
02:00:24,634 --> 02:00:26,886
"and defiled the honor

1065
02:00:26,969 --> 02:00:30,348
"of public service."

1066
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:33,851
Hey, why am I writing this?

1067
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:38,356
They asked what he said,
so I repeated word for word.

1068
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:40,358
So why the written apology?

1069
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,695
Why did he have to swear?

1070
02:00:50,076 --> 02:00:51,118
Shostakovich.

1071
02:00:51,202 --> 02:00:55,164
<i>That was Shostakovich's</i>
<i>Violin Concerto No. 1.</i>

1072
02:00:56,457 --> 02:00:58,167
<i>Today, Mr. Lee leaves the hospital</i>…

1073
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:00,711
Any longer down there,
I'd have composed a symphony.

1074
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:04,632
<i>For you, it's the end</i>
<i>of a truly long and difficult journey.</i>

1075
02:01:04,715 --> 02:01:09,011
<i>I hope you can enjoy everything</i>
<i>you've missed all this time.</i>

1076
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,430
<i>Soo-jin, go to bed early tonight.</i>

1077
02:01:12,014 --> 02:01:15,309
<i>Have a great night later.</i>

1078
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:18,104
-Is he nuts?
-Strange sense of humor.

1079
02:01:18,187 --> 02:01:19,939
They don't cut out stuff like that?

1080
02:01:20,606 --> 02:01:23,859
Mom cooked beef ribs. That okay?

1081
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,903
Yeah!

1082
02:01:27,405 --> 02:01:30,408
<i>Tunnel ahead. Drive safely.</i>

1083
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:31,617
Oh, damn…
