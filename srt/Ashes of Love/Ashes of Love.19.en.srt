1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
Ashes of Love

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Episode 19

3
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,180
Mister Immortal,

4
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,580
Fire Immortal wants to meet you.

5
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,560
Please.

6
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,080
No.

7
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,880
No.

8
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,060
I have to go back.

9
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Military orders cannot be disobeyed.

10
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,220
Xu Feng, don’t act recklessly.

11
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
Why does she suffer from undeserved misfortune

12
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,620
when I’m not by her side?

13
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,900
Who did this this time?

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
That Jin Mi experiences hardships to get promoted

15
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,620
is Heavenly Emperor’s order,

16
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,020
which is imperative.

17
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,800
It’s useless for you to go back now.

18
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,020
You may listen to Yuan Ji’s explanation.

19
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,540
Your Highness.

20
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,220
Forego the formality, Miss Fairy.

21
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,240
Ji Ji

22
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,420
Hong Hong

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,400
Are you going to change your job and join the army?

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,740
The head of an army can be changed,

25
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,300
but an ordinary person’s ambition is unswerving.

26
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,760
To be a matchmaker

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,340
is my lifelong ambition.

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
How can I quit it halfway?

29
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,420
Then are you going to make a match
between fairies and demons.

30
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,980
But in the army,

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,620
there are all menfolk.

32
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,420
I heard that today the Empyrean Cloud Palace,

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,180
Fairy Yuan Ji, you

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,980
showed your deduction skill in public.

35
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,580
Well...

36
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,900
You are too serious.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,420
But it is matter of destiny.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,440
And it is also about Fairy Jin Mi’s fairy foundation.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,980
So I had to tell the truth.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,540
Do you know the consequences of
inaccurate deduction, Fairy Yuan Ji?

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,060
I definitely know.

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,760
But because of my duties,

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,100
I don’t dare to make any mistakes.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,400
I wonder what numerology you have arranged for Jin Mi

45
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,540
in her hardship experiences in the Human Realm?

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,720
Well...

47
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,640
What kind of hardship?

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,800
What kind of fate?

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,540
How are her parents? What kind of family?

50
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,880
What kind of people

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,700
does she get in touch with in daily life?

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,820
How long will the experience last?

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
And so on

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,100
Are there detailed items for these arrangements?

55
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,440
Well...

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,420
Every human being has to suffer seven sorrows,

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,040
including birth, senility, sickness, death,

58
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,320
being together with the despised ones,

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,700
not getting what one wants,

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,580
and being apart from the loved ones.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,840
Well...

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,980
I hope you can understand and forgive me,
Your Highness.

63
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,160
Since it’s “experiencing hardships”,

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,580
Fairy Jin Mi should suffer all of the...

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,640
suffer as much as possible.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,520
If she can suffer all of the seven sorrows...

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,120
I will give Jin Mi

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,680
a good husband.

69
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,640
Don’t worry, Xu Feng.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,980
Who do you want to let Jin Mi love and be apart from?

71
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,600
No.

72
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,560
Or

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,580
let's arrange a lone-star fate

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,340
for Jin Mi,

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,660
whose identity is a nun who discards the worldly affairs.

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,580
What do you think, Your Highness?

77
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,240
No.

78
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,320
If she really realizes something,

79
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,240
who can be responsible for this?

80
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,580
Then

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,640
let her be a male?

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,740
No.

83
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,460
How could you think up this?

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,420
I have an idea.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,280
There is a family called Saint Doctor Family.

86
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
They are good at making medicine.

87
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,840
To pray for their King’s long life with pure souls

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,800
is their pursuit.

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Therefore, in their family,
there are all females who are virgins.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,280
Not to mention strangers,

91
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,900
they can’t even

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,900
see any unknown birds or bugs.

93
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,680
Occasionally when they go outside,

94
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,140
they will take back and raise those abandoned baby girls

95
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,960
to make their family lasting.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,240
This family impose extremely demanding
requirement on the saint girls.

97
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,160
They can’t show their face to males all their life.

98
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,320
They can’t get married,

99
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,260
let alone being apart from the loved ones.

100
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,200
Then

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,020
let’s arrange this for the time being.

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,400
This mother and her son

103
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,400
are so annoying.

104
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,780
Are you going to obey Heavenly Empress

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,960
or Xu Feng?

106
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,720
In charge of arranging human beings' fates,
I rank low but I have great power.

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,000
If I submit to those with strong power easily,

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,680
how can keep my job?

109
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,720
I will definitely perform Heavenly Emperor’s order.

110
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,620
You are of integrity.

111
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,520
The person who can support them is Heavenly Emperor.

112
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,240
I can’t afford to displease these two immortals.

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,900
Fortunately, I can adjust to the changing circumstances,

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,300
coming up with a solution that is satisfactory to both sides.

115
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,860
What solution?

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,740
The fate I arrange for Fairy Jin Mi

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,600
is the most miserable one

118
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,320
in the Saint Doctor Family.

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,400
I’m sure it can satisfy Heavenly Empress
and make Fire Immortal feel relieved.

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,760
Great idea.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,640
Now here is finally the chance

122
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,800
for me to show my capabilities.

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,440
Are you going to be a tailor again?

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,700
It’s for making a match

125
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,080
for Jin Mi who is going to experience hardships.

126
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,960
Hum!

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,960
Heavenly Empress goes beyond
her business to meddle in my job.

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,540
Xu Feng wants decide for himself.

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
How can they?

130
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,920
They can only intervene fairs and immortals’ affairs.

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,840
But the marriage in human beings’ life is managed by me.

132
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,280
This time, Jin Mi is just not allowed to suffer
the sorrow of being apart from her loved ones.

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,340
But except the sorrow of being apart from the loved ones,

134
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,320
if she is to experience

135
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
some heartbreaking tragic romance,

136
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,860
we are not to blame.

137
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,860
Right?

138
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,120
Exactly.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
We are innocent.

140
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,640
It’s OK. It’s OK.

141
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
There are just seven sorrows.

142
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,180
The sorrows like birth, senility, sickness, death
and being apart from the loved ones

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,220
are much easier than the “81 difficulties”.

144
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,160
Am I right?

145
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,900
Daddy,

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,900
did I say anything wrong?

147
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,920
Master gave us a hint, but she didn’t say it directly.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,540
I didn’t expect what she said comes true now.

149
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,620
Although you will suffer a lot when you go to
experience hardships in Human Realm,

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,449
it’s a good thing

151
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,500
if it can resolve the disaster
and consolidate your power.

152
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
Don’t worry, Mister Immortals.

153
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,060
Experiencing hardships in the
Human Realm only last dozens of days.

154
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,120
Mi is my future wife.

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,240
I cannot interfere with her experience,

156
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,160
but I’m willing to go to the Human Realm

157
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,340
to accompany her,

158
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,300
living the life in the Human Realm together.

159
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,400
The person trespassing Qiwu Palace without notice

160
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,600
turns out to be you.

161
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,020
What’s the reason for you

162
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,340
to come here?

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Mister Immortal Jin Mi.

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,720
Senior Liao Ting.

165
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
I can’t afford it, Mister Immortal.

166
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,800
When you worked at Qiwu Palace

167
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,420
you never called me that.

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,020
Now you are already an immortal.

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,540
So don't be so courteous.

170
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,600
What’s more, you have already
been engaged with someone else.

171
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
So please stop disturbing His Highness.

172
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,240
We are always the pupils of the same master.

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,220
Liao Ting

174
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,760
You, me,

175
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,900
Fei Xu and Phoenix,

176
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,860
we are always family.

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,780
Don't try to leave me alone.

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,940
What are you doing here?

179
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,520
This is the osmanthus wine I made myself.

180
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,660
I was going to give a reception
in honor of him with this wine

181
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,900
when he comes back from the battle.

182
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,600
But I am going to experience hardships
in the Human Realm.

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,100
I don't know when I can come back.

184
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,440
So I bring the wine here from the Floral Realm.

185
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,740
If Phoenix comes back earlier than me,

186
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,660
remember to tell him

187
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,540
that I buried the osmanthus wine here.

188
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,760
You still have conscience.

189
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,880
Don’t worry.

190
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,460
His Highness will definitely wait for you to come back

191
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,420
and then drink the wine.

192
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,580
You are good at nothing.

193
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,327
It’s OK.
It’s buried improperly.

194
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:25,953
Let's do it together.

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,020
Your Highness.

196
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
The lords of West City and North City
haven’t taken any unusual actions.

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,780
They both have already withdrawn the army.

198
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,360
Got it.

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,540
Today is the day for Jin Mi to go to the Human Realm.

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,380
I hope that I still have time to say goodbye.

201
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
This time the Demon Realm doesn’t attempt
to invade the Heavenly Realm.

202
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,100
It’s just an internal battle for territory.

203
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,740
Your Highness, you were right.
I really admire you.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,940
This place is not far from the territory of King of Bian City.

205
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,380
Liu Ying’s hidden guards

206
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,960
have also slipped into in the military camps of both sides.

207
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,220
If there is really something abnormal,

208
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,040
King of Bian City won’t ignore it.

209
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,960
Transmit my order.

210
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,700
order the Mister Po Jun to lead the Right Army

211
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,960
to continue stationing and making supervision.

212
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,840
With him being here, I feel relieved.

213
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,300
You lead the main force and withdraw.

214
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,460
I’m going back to report to Father.

215
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,280
Yes, Your Highness.

216
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,200
Take much care, daddy.

217
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,560
I will be back soon.

218
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,880
Fairy Jin Mi, please.

219
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,180
You will meet each other soon.

220
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,420
But you will have to bid farewell finally.

221
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,600
Rou Rou, can we really meet each other again?

222
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,520
I guess I will be back

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,220
when Phoenix finishes drinking the osmanthus wine.

224
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,980
Jin Mi

225
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,040
Take much care.

226
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,520
This time we say goodbye.

227
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,600
I don’t know when we will see each other again.

228
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,660
Don’t worry.

229
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,020
I will be back soon.

230
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,060
Jin Mi.

231
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,800
Farewell.

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,120
Farewell?

233
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,580
Being late will make big difference in your fate,

234
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,880
and it will also affect the quality of experiencing hardships.

235
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,440
Life is short. It’s just an blink of an eye.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,280
Jumping into this Cause and Effect Sinning Plate,

237
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,900
you will come back soon and become a new person.

238
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,580
Your Highness, you are back finally.

239
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,000
Your Highness,

240
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,620
I saw a shadow

241
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,060
slip into the Zifang Cloud Palace.

242
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,820
I thought he was Rat Fairy’s fellow.

243
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,240
So I followed him to the side hall of the palace.

244
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,800
Unexpectedly...

245
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,060
Is Mother in danger?

246
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,260
Her Majesty is fine.

247
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,120
But I unintentionally

248
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,880
heard the conversation between that man and Her Majesty.

249
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,140
It turns out that Her Majesty deliberately
sent you to Wangchuan River,

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,080
intending to take advantage of your unpreparedness

251
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,380
to...

252
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,460
to kill Jin Mi in the Human Realm.

253
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,840
I’m going to the Human Realm.

254
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,580
Step aside.

255
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,480
It’s in curfew now.
Please understand, Your Highness.

256
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,160
Xu Feng,

257
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,920
why are you so late?

258
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,000
You couldn’t even say goodbye to Jin Mi.

259
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Where is Jin Mi now?

260
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
She’s gone to the Human Realm.

261
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,000
Make me and Jin Mi be together.

262
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,380
OK.

263
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,720
Your Majesty.

264
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,400
His Highness rushed to the Southern Heavenly Gate,
intending to go to the Human Realm.

265
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,200
Seeing it’s in curfew, His Highness...

266
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,540
he went in the direction of Cause and Effect Sinning Plate.

267
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
Compete with me?

268
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,940
Once you jump into the Cause and Effect Sinning Plate

269
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,200
You won’t be able to come back.

270
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,600
How can you compete with me?

271
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,180
Your Highness.

272
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,580
How can we cancel the experience?

273
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,940
She has gone.

274
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,820
How can I cancel it?

275
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,780
Your Highness, Fairy Yuan Ji
is just performing her duties.

276
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,480
Your Highness.

277
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,920
Your Highness.

278
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,740
Xu Feng.

279
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,720
Xu Feng

280
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,080
Xu Feng. Your Highness.

281
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,540
Lord Liaoyuan.

282
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,800
Take good care of Xu Feng.

283
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,440
Fairy Yuan Ji.

284
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,880
I will definitely arrange a good fate

285
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,880
for His Highness and Princess Sui He.

286
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,840
In the Human Realm, His Highness

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,140
will have his mind filled with knowledge
about statesmanship in terms of literature,

288
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
and be able to bring peace and stability to his country
with high prestige in terms of military affairs.

289
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,260
Princess Sui He will be beautiful and rich,

290
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,660
being loved by many people.

291
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,980
In short, I will let them

292
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,660
live a smooth life in the Human Realm.

293
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,180
Good.

294
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,380
It’s good that you know what you should do.

295
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,480
Why am I so unlucky?

296
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,280
Why is it a girl?

297
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,600
What a bad luck!

298
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Throw it away.

299
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,920
We can’t afford to feed her.

300
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,560
Child, I’m so sorry.

301
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,240
I hope that God will answer my call,

302
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,220
and arrange a good family for you.

303
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,360
No, it’s wrong.

304
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,120
Since it’s in autumn now,
the handle of the Dipper should face the west.

305
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,500
Mi must have been born.

306
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,640
Help me take it.

307
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,740
OK.

308
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,800
Here you are. Dry it in the sun over there.

309
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,460
Here.

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,180
How about this one?

311
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,040
It's not bad.

312
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,840
Sure. No problem.

313
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
Cut it into pieces evenly.

314
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,340
Okay.

315
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,180
Help me hold it.

316
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,120
Let me.

317
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,240
Thank you.

318
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,500
This is the medicine that has just been picked.
Here you are.

319
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,600
Take this one and dry it in the sun over there.

320
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,220
OK.

321
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,060
Let me have a check.

322
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,780
It’s OK now.

323
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,480
Slow down. Slow down.

324
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,800
Take this one and dry it in the sun over there.

325
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,540
OK.

326
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,100
Take this.

327
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,740
OK.

328
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,680
Categorize these herbs.

329
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,300
This one is good. Take it.

330
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,880
OK.

331
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,460
Let me check this.

332
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
This one has almost been dried well.

333
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,020
Put it away.

334
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,740
Has the medicine been cooked?
Slow down. Slow down.

335
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,280
Good girl.

336
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,660
Right?

337
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,300
What? So cute.

338
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,220
Is it a brother or a sister?

339
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,180
I don’t know either.

340
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,580
I think it’s a brother.

341
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,720
I think it’s a sister. You?

342
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,500
Just guess. Is she beautiful like us?

343
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,380
She must be not as beautiful as we are.

344
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,360
Then let's go inside and have a look.

345
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,260
Okay.

346
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,080
What is this?

347
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,960
Look. It’s an apple.

348
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,920
What’s wrong?

349
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,860
Come.

350
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,500
Be good.

351
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,900
Drink the medicine.

352
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,660
Don't cry. Don’t cry.

353
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,720
Don’t cry.

354
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,120
Don’t cry.

355
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,500
This child is so cute.

356
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,060
The Saint Doctor Family lives in a remote and quiet place,

357
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,060
which be regarded as a pure place.

358
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,880
It’s good for her practice.

359
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
You have a check

360
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,480
and see if there is anyone intervening Jin Mi’s experience.

361
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,300
If everything is normal, then return to Heavenly Realm.

362
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,640
This matter should be kept secrete.

363
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,540
If there is any changes,

365
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,720
report to me with silent words in time.

366
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,520
Your Majesty.

367
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,140
Are Sui He and Xu Feng OK?

368
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,600
Your Majesty, they both are good,

369
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,780
having been born at the Palace of
King Yi in the Human Realm.

370
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,640
Manage to restore Sui He’s memory

371
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,120
so that they

372
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,400
can take this opportunity to cultivate affection for each other.

373
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,440
What about Jin Mi?

375
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,500
The Heavenly Emperor assigned Fairy Yuan Ji
to take care of Jin Mi day and night.

376
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,400
I don’t have chance to kill Jin Mi.

377
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,120
Forget it.

378
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,500
Put it off for a few days

379
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,940
in order not to let His Majesty catch hold of me.

380
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,120
Got it, Your Majesty.

381
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,180
Has your Killing Arrow been made?

382
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,400
Your Majesty,

383
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,360
Killing Arrow is made from my blood and bones.

384
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,460
It takes much time to make it.

385
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,540
Please give me another several days.

386
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Several days?

387
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,200
Alright.

388
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,660
Then I will give you several days.

389
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

390
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,880
My name is Jin Mi.

391
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
I’m an orphan.

392
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,820
I was adopted and has been raised up
by my aunt from an early age.

393
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,940
Jin Mi.

394
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Why does it rain every time

395
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,540
when I collect herbs with you?

396
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,860
Why does it never rain when I go to collect herbs on my own?

397
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,280
I don’t know, either.

398
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,980
I am so unlucky.

399
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,200
Qiang Huo

400
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,500
is my good friend.

401
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,820
When I was twelve years old, the past Saint Girl
was buried alive with the dead king.

402
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,980
The elders and aunts negotiated

403
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,900
and made me be the new Saint Girl.

404
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,700
Qiang Huo.

405
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,200
I feel a little dizzy.

406
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,640
Jin Mi, what's wrong with you?

407
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,020
Are you poisoned?

408
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,560
Come here. Take a rest here for a while.

409
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,100
I am going to ask aunt to save you.

410
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,860
Jin...Jin Mi.

411
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
There is a bug on your body.

412
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,840
I’m calm and rational.

413
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,360
I’m calm and rational.

414
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,340
It can be made into medicine.

415
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,200
You made my dress dirty.

416
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,680
I must report this to aunt.

417
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,600
I’m don’t care even if you report this to her.

418
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,340
Who made you scare me first?

419
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,960
Don't run.

420
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,800
Don't come over. Don’t come over.

421
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,420
Qiang Huo.

422
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,960
Actually,

423
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,400
I have a secret.

424
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,160
I can see fairies since the childhood.

425
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,380
Are the fairies beautiful?

426
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,620
Yes, they are.

427
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,700
Fairies are naturally beautiful.

428
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,680
They have strong magic power, right?

429
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,800
They have four heads and eight hands.

430
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,180
And they are as tall as the mountain.

431
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,840
Nonsense.

432
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,420
I’m serious.

433
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,820
I can really see the fairies.

434
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
I don't believe it.

435
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,080
You must be kidding me.

436
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,580
You see them in your dreams, right?

437
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,100
You see them in your dreams.

438
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,140
I’m not like you, always tending to be puzzled?

439
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,760
I can really see fairies.

440
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,200
They were standing in front of me,

441
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,720
and waving greetings to me.

442
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,940
I don't believe it.

443
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
You must be kidding.

444
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,040
Believe it or not.

445
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,660
Anyway, I can really see them.

446
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,380
I can see them since the childhood.

447
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,040
Then tell me

448
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,520
what do they look like?

449
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,360
I...

450
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,260
Qiang Huo, I was hit.

451
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,840
Yeah, I saw that.

452
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,560
I was hit by a potato.

453
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,200
Right.

454
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,660
How come potatoes grow on the tree?

455
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,340
I wonder why

456
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,400
bad luck always happens to me.

457
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
But actually I have got used to it now.

458
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,380
With the accompany of Qiang Huo,

459
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,360
I grow up in struggle.

460
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,180
I went to the Human Realm with my soul
and observed for several days.

461
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,860
So far, Jin Mi is fine.

462
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,360
She just often encounter some small setbacks.

463
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,660
But regardless of these setbacks,
she is very happy and feels at ease.

464
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,240
She is still so heartless.

465
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,740
Fortunately, Night Immortal

466
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,120
can take advantage of his night shift

467
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,960
to quietly take care of Jin Mi for us.

468
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,520
I’m still worried.

469
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,200
Our Floral Realm is free from
the regulation of Heavenly Realm.

470
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,720
I can go to take care of her in the Heavenly Realm.

471
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,260
Please feel relieved, everybody.

472
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,520
That Jin Mi experiences hardships

473
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,040
is Heavenly Emperor’s order.

474
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,800
It’s improper for you immortals
to often show up in the Human Realm,

475
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,540
because it may give cause for gossip,

476
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,360
which instead will make it difficult
for Jin Mi to ge promoted.

477
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,240
From now on, I’m your eyes.

478
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,000
Let me protect Jin Mi.

479
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,060
Xu Feng is now in Human Realm.

480
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,120
It’s inevitable for him to suffer from
the hardships of fighting in the battles.

481
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,380
As his biological mother,

482
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
I really can’t bear to see him suffer.

483
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,800
Your Majesty. His Highness is the Fire Immortal.

484
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,080
Even though he is now in the
Human Realm as a human being,

485
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,660
his fate is incomparable.

486
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,240
What’s more, I can’t control
the lucks in the Human Realm.

487
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,060
But I believe

488
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,540
with strong power,

489
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,280
His Highness must be unbeatable,
and change the misfortunes into the fortunes.

490
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,120
If not for the sake of Xu Feng’ s soul,

491
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,500
I can’t wait to interrupt this hardship experience.

492
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,400
His Highness can accumulate merits
and virtues in the Human Realm,

493
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,320
which is good for his practice.

494
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,420
You just say things that are pleasant.

495
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,140
What is Jin Mi?

496
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,840
How is she?

497
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,260
Your Majesty,

498
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,700
Jin Mi is now in the Saint Doctor Family.

499
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,860
She is practicing identifying flowers and herbs.

500
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,500
What?

501
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,380
Identifying flowers and herbs?

502
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,980
What kind of hardship experience is it?

503
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,100
Your Majesty.

504
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,660
Her fate has been fixed.
It’s not appropriate to intervene too much.

505
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,380
Fairy Yuan Ji.

506
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,780
Do you remember why

507
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,060
Why did Six Stars of Sagittarius give up

508
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,700
being Xuanqing Jiuzhen Commander

509
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,700
and let you take this position?

510
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,580
It’s just a slip of tongue.

511
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,320
I must follow your orders, Your Majesty.

512
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,640
Very good.

513
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I can’t bear anything perfunctory.

514
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,880
Since it’s hardship experiences,

515
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,080
one must experience the heartbreaking sufferings.

516
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,840
Otherwise, it will be a deceitful trick.

517
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,020
Your Majesty. I’m timid.

518
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,820
I have always followed the rules,

519
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,800
doing what Heavenly Emperor requires.

520
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,020
Don't threaten me by mentioning
the Heavenly Emperor.

521
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,120
He never said that he would not let Jin Mi suffer.

522
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,980
I won’t put you in an awkward situation.

523
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,940
I just want to teach you one word.

524
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
You can’t be a fairy or immortal
if you don’t pretend to be deaf and dumb.

525
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,280
Your Majesty, I must keep this in mind.

526
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,140
Good.

527
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,140
You may leave now.

528
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,200
It’s said that the world was in chaos and not unified.

529
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,480
People had been leading a precarious life

530
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,920
in an abyss of suffering,

531
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,280
until a lad appeared

532
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,600
and made vigorous efforts to save the world.

533
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,920
This lad is the present King Yi.

534
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,160
Where his long sword is, there is a gale

535
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,240
stopping the fight without using military forces.

536
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,060
Great.

537
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,580
Great.

538
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,260
There are my heroes in the troubled times,
but they can’t be compared with King Yi.

539
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,420
The one who can unify the world

540
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,480
and rescue people in sore straits

541
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,700
is this battle master,

542
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,800
King Yi

543
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
Great.

544
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,580
Great.

545
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,220
Jin Mi,

546
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,320
King Yi is really a big hero.

547
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,780
What millions died that Caesar might be great.

548
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,680
In the rise or fall of the world,

549
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,320
it’s the ordinary people who suffer a lot.

550
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,560
What did you say?

551
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,060
Nothing.

552
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,140
I said that the King Yi is a big hero.

553
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,960
He will definitely live a long life.

554
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,100
I have to be buried alive if he dies.

555
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,560
Alright. It’s too late now.

556
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,560
Let’s go back now.

557
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,480
Go.

558
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,140
Hurry up.

559
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,340
King Yi is man of striking appearance,
able to wield both the pen and the sword.

560
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,720
He is really the man of girls’ dreams.

561
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,280
Wait.

562
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,060
But he has already been engaged
with Princess Nan Ping.

563
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,580
Turn round and round.

564
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,780
Be quick.

565
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,100
Turn round and round.

566
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,060
Be quick.

567
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,260
Auntie.

568
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,140
These days, you have been making
medicinal meals with Qiang Huo.

569
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,060
It’s really laborious.

570
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,360
Let me make the medicine.

571
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,780
Thanks for your hard work, auntie.

572
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,800
By the way,

573
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,880
I went to the pharmacy just now,

574
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,460
and found that a few herbs are missing.

575
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,200
Let me go to the Luoye Mountain with Qiang Huo

576
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,380
and collect some.

577
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,860
Really?

578
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,380
There must be a lot of fun
and delicious in the outside world.

579
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,340
Qiang Huo.

580
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,560
You grew up with the Saint Girl.

581
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,240
Why haven’t you learned from her

582
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,500
in terms of the quality of being mellow?

583
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,980
Since the Saint Girl asks you to follow her

584
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,380
and teaches you in person,

585
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,860
you should improve yourself.

586
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,360
Assist the Saint Girl

587
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,140
Look at you. You are so restless.

588
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,780
I think you shouldn’t go with the Saint Girl.

589
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,900
Stay here and assist me in making medicine.

590
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,340
Auntie.

591
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,080
The Saint Girl shouldn’t go outside
to collect herbs alone.

592
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,540
What’s more, it takes several days.

593
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,860
It’s OK.

594
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,880
It’s OK.

595
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,380
Many other girls do not have the chance

596
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,460
to assist auntie.

597
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,920
Qiang Huo.

598
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,040
During this period,

599
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,640
you should work hard and learn from auntie.

600
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,220
When I come back, you will have made progress.

601
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,800
And you will be able assist me better.

602
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,140
Oh.

603
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,180
Saint Girl, you are really thoughtful.

604
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,660
But it’s really improper

605
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,360
for you to go outside alone to collect herbs.

606
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,120
I grew up in these mountains.

607
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,740
I can recognize all the paths.

608
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,180
You must know about this, auntie.

609
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,800
If you let these little girls follow me,

610
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,720
when they are lost,

611
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,040
I will have to struggle to look for them.
Am I right?

612
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,200
Sorry to bother you during these days, auntie.

613
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
I will come back soon.

614
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,700
OK. Be careful.

615
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,540
May King Yi have a long life.

616
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,400
May King Yi have a long life.

617
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,680
May King Yi have a long life.

618
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,920
You guess right.

619
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,880
We are the Saint Doctor Family

620
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,000
devoted to making medicine for King Yi.

621
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,760
However,

622
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,500
I heard that the current King Yi is not an old man.

623
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,980
Instead, he is a young man.

624
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,380
But everything

625
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,280
that he eats,

626
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,800
from a bowl of medicinal meal

627
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,080
to the medicine for longevity,

628
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
is all made by us Saint Doctor Family.

629
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,340
But this medicine for longevity

630
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,580
is still in the process of continuous refinement.

631
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,420
This medicine should be made
successfully as early as possible.

632
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,580
Otherwise...

633
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,400
Your Majesty.

634
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,280
Qin Tong

635
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,640
You lead the generals and soldiers
and rest here for a few days.

636
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,660
I will finish hunting and come back soon.

637
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

638
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,660
Your Majesty.

639
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,780
People from Liangguo.

640
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,700
Break through with me.

641
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,200
He has really become a human.

642
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,980
Help me.
