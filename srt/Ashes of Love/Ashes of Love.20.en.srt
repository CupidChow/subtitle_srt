1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
Ashes of Love

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Episode 20

3
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
He has really become a human.

4
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
Help me.

5
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
Help me.

6
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
She’s from the Heaven Realm.

7
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,400
Nether Fury reappears in the world

8
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
It turns out that the Mieling Family still exists.

9
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
The person from the Mieling Family
who can summon Nether Fury

10
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,080
is definitely not ordinary.

11
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Is it him?

12
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
Xuan

13
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
Demon Lord.

14
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Xuan.

15
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
Has the prince turned better?

16
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,040
Still the same.

17
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
There is no sign for him to wake up.

18
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,440
The Fire Immortal said the prince would wake up

19
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
three days after having the Golden Reinvigorating Elixir.

20
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,160
So many days have passed,

21
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
but the prince still hasn’t waken up.

22
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
I think people from the Heaven Realm

23
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
is really not trustable.

24
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Xu Feng.

25
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
I think

26
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,800
Fire Immortal deliberately

27
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,960
ignored the safety of the princes.

28
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Now Prince Xuan Shou is unconscious.

29
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,680
And Prince Chi Shou is mad.

30
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,200
The future of the Demon Realm is worrying.

31
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,840
This is clearly the scheme of Heaven Realm

32
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,920
to oppress we Demon Realm.

33
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,960
If Xuan can’t wake up,

34
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,440
I will not let

35
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
Xu Feng, the villain from the
Heaven Realm get away with this easily.

36
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,120
He killed so many soldiers

37
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,160
Is he a desperate bandit?

38
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
A doctor with conscience should treat
patients equally regardless of their identity.

39
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
But this bandit look

40
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,160
this bandit has fine skin and soft skin.

41
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,680
He just got skin trauma.

42
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
So the blood on his body belongs to others.

43
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
Among so many people,

44
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,680
only you have survived.

45
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,400
You are so lucky.

46
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,760
The situation is a little tricky.

47
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,760
But you are lucky enough

48
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
to meet me, an outstanding doctor.

49
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,360
Otherwise, your will be in danger.

50
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,360
I am going to get you medicine now.

51
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
Just lie down.

52
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,120
Your wounds are not a bruise.

53
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,960
They are obviously caused by sharp weapons.

54
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
How come?

55
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
I remember at the time

56
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,520
his long knife was coming at me.

57
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
She’s from the Heaven Realm.

58
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,760
I suddenly felt warmth in my heart at that time.

59
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,080
When I realized what’s happening,

60
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,520
I found I just got skin trauma.

61
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,200
That guy is a coward.

62
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
He ran way when he failed to kill me in one strike.

63
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,480
So I don’t know

64
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
what has happened exactly.

65
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
It’s a narrow squeak.

66
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,960
Fortunately, God blesses me.

67
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
It’s good that you are fine.

68
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
Do you remember who did this?

69
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
The guy wore a mask.

70
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,080
I couldn’t see his face clearly.

71
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
Strange

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,040
We Saint Doctor Family lives in isolation.

73
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,920
And we are always friendly to others

74
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
Who wants to kill you?

75
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,440
I don't think his goal is me.

76
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
It’s just because I was in the way.

77
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,400
By the way,

78
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
be sure not to

79
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,960
tell the elders and aunt about this.

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
I just got skin trauma.

81
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
I don’t want them to get worried.

82
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,880
Understand?

83
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,280
I finally found you.

84
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,560
What...what are you doing here in the middle of the night?

85
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
I was about to ask you this question, too.

86
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
This millennium snow ginseng

87
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,280
is used as the guiding herb of
Longevity Qiankun Pill for King Yi.

88
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,280
Why do you take it in the middle of the night?

89
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
Yes.

90
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,040
I am going to use it to make medicine for King Yi.

91
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Don't fool me.

92
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,920
The medicine has not been refined yet.

93
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,280
Why do you need this guiding herb?

94
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,680
Are you going to

95
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,240
use it to treat someone irrelevant ?

96
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Don’t say nonsense.

97
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I didn’t meet anyone irrelevant.

98
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
When I bandaged your wound,

99
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
you hesitated in speaking.

100
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,440
There must be something weird.

101
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
Is it true that you met someone

102
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,920
when you entered the mountain?

103
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,520
Doctors should be benevolent,

104
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,680
doing good deeds for other regardless of their identity.

105
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
Do you forget what

106
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
auntie teaches in daily life ?

107
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Sure enough.

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Who is it?

109
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,560
It’s good for you

110
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,120
not to know about this matter.

111
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,520
If you auntie and the elders know about this

112
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
you will get into trouble.

113
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,360
I can bear to see you get killed.

114
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
Only we two know about this.

115
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,640
As long as you don't tell others, I won't die.

116
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:13,960
Qiang Huo.

117
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,520
But

118
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,960
Jin Mi, you are the Saint Girl in our family.

119
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,760
Give it to me.

120
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,840
Give me.

121
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Tell me.

122
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,840
In the one hundred years’ history
of we Saint Doctor Family,

123
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
we have served six Kings.

124
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
Did any Saint Girl

125
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
really make the medicine for longevity successfully?

126
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
Did any King Yi really become immortal?

127
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,160
If there is really medicine that can make people immortal,

128
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
why does the sixth generation King Yi exist?

129
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
The powerful people pursue long life.

130
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
But it’s just a dream

131
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
that can’t be realized.

132
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
And we still try to make this kind of medicine.

133
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
We know it's impossible.
We are just fooling ourselves as well as others.

134
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
Why shouldn’t we give these herbs

135
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
to those in need.

136
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Anyway, I won’t let you to seek your doom.

137
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,200
We all have no reason to get killed because of you.

138
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Qiang Huo. Listen.

139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I am a Saint Girl.

140
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
Don’t worry.

141
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,360
You all can count on me.

142
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,640
The worst result is that I pay him with my life.

143
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Anyway, my life is at the hand of King Yi.

144
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,760
You don't cherish your life,

145
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
but I can't bear to see you get killed.

146
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
I can obey you in terms of other matters.

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,400
But I can’t obey you in terms of this one.

148
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,000
Qiang Huo.

149
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,560
Sorry.

150
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,160
You...again.

151
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,440
Sorry, Qiang Huo.

152
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Dress for females.

153
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Am I...

154
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
Am I dead?

155
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,080
And my soul comes out from my body?

156
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
The sleeping manner of this guy

157
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
is so bad.

158
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,280
He even took off his clothes when asleep.

159
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,000
The millennium snow ginseng is so awesome.

160
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,880
Why does this guy look so familiar?

161
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,880
Is he dumb?

162
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
How come I lost my voice?

163
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,920
Not me.

164
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
I also am deaf.

165
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
He is also deaf.

166
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,080
Why did I take this damn sword back?

167
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
It’s only myself to blame.

168
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,680
I...

169
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
I...

170
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,040
Doctor.

171
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,800
It’s me. Is she the one who saved me?

172
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
I bandaged your wounds.

173
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Finally he realized the truth.

174
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,200
I am your benefactor.

175
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,760
I saved you with good intention.

176
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
But you are so ungrateful.

177
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
You almost made my waist broken just now.

178
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
Your clothes

179
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Your clothes are dirty.

180
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,560
With blood.

181
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,720
Very smelly.

182
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,400
You can't wear it.

183
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,920
You can't wear it.

184
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
What happened to me?

185
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,280
Who is the man in black?

186
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,640
Was he sent by Duke Nanping?

187
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,320
What do you want to say?

188
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Write it down with this.

189
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,560
What’s wrong with me?

190
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,360
It’s so surprising that this bandit

191
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
are well-educated.

192
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,720
Good handwriting.

193
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
Different deceases should be treated
with different kinds of medicine.

194
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,680
Would you mind telling me about your daily diet?

195
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,960
Stewed razor clam with snake gourd,
stewed reeve muntjac with kusnezoff monkshood root,

196
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,720
hellebore and liquorice soup,
stewed chicken with ginseng and phumile,

197
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
Stewed partridge with fritillary.

198
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,440
How can a bandit

199
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,440
afford to these good meals.

200
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
The reason why you fainted

201
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
is the exhaustion of physical strength

202
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
after you fought with others.

203
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
But your deafness and dumbness

204
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,840
has been brewing for quite some time.

205
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
Some herbs can produce poison if combined together.

206
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Poisoning?

207
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Banlou,

208
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,720
snakegourd fruit, fritillaria

209
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Zhushen,

210
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,440
Xinshao and Panlilu

211
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,341
In your daily meals

212
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,120
there were several dishes that are
poisonous if combined together.

213
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,840
You ate them everyday,
so the poison has been accumulated in your body.

214
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,160
If not treated in time,

215
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
you will die within one year.

216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Is there any treatment for this?

217
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,960
The uncommon decease

218
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,120
happens to extraordinary people.

219
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,440
It’s just a piece of cake.

220
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,800
You looked so wicked just now.

221
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
You almost strangled me to death.

222
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Then I’ll let you try some powerful herbs.

223
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
In the past, I checked these herbs by eating them myself.

224
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,720
Nowadays...

225
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,440
Your Highness.

226
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,040
You don’t like the knifes and swords.

227
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,240
How come you start to train the Phoenix Troop?

228
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,760
Because my cousin likes it.

229
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,800
Only the one who has strong power can be the king.

230
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,920
If I don’t even understand any military affair,

231
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,800
how can I become a helpful wife of my cousin.

232
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
If His Majesty knows about your good intention,

233
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,240
he must be very happy.

234
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,280
By the way, don’t let other know

235
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,480
that we are secretly doing military training here.

236
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
When my cousin comes back,

237
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,840
I will give him this surprise.

238
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,480
Yes, Your Highness.

239
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,920
Ask them to practice hard.

240
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
If they do well, I will give them big reward.

241
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,360
Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
Bad news, Your Highness.

243
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,640
What happened?

244
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
Something bad happened to His Majesty.

245
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,600
What?

246
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,640
This time, Fire Immortal is
experiencing hardships in the Human Realm.

247
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,520
Is it true?

248
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,680
I saw him in person.

249
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,880
Fire Immortal is really a human being now.

250
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
He got injured badly after fighting
against about only one hundred people.

251
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,880
Since he is a human being and badly injured,

252
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
why didn’t he kill him?

253
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,680
My Lord.

254
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,760
I did want to kill him.

255
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,000
But when I was about to kill him,

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
a girl with a mask suddenly appeared.

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
I thought she was just a human.

258
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,800
But when I swept the knife toward her,

259
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,120
the knife was bounced back by a magic power.

260
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
She seems to have a something magic to protect herself.

261
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,880
I’m afraid there would be some
hidden soldiers from Heaven Realm.

262
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
I didn’t dare to take any action,

263
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
so I chose to come back and report this to you first.

264
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,480
You are useless.

265
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,480
You can’t even handle a badly injured human.

266
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
You are not capable of being a demon.

267
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,960
Go back and be a human.

268
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,760
Leave, now.

269
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,520
Thanks, My Lord.

270
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
The Mieling Family reappeared.

271
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
And the Fire Immortal becomes alert.

272
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,760
Is it that God wants me to die?

273
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,040
Congratulations, my Lord.

274
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
This is the sign of good luck.

275
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
Among the beings in Demon Realm

276
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
you are the most capacious one.

277
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,240
You words are not consistent.

278
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
Why did you say so?

279
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,160
If we use common knives or swords to kill Fire Immortal,

280
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,800
it will help him end his hardship experience

281
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,240
and returns to the Heaven Realm earlier,

282
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,600
which won’t bring any benefit to us.

283
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
So in your opinion,

284
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
we can just make him

285
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
live happily in the Human Realm?

286
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,600
My Lord, do you forget

287
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,800
the Mieling Arrow?

288
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
Fire Immortal is experiencing hardships,

289
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
and coincidentally the Mieling Family
reappears in the world.

290
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
Isn’t it a good chance for us?

291
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,800
You mean

292
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
To steel the Mieling Arrow

293
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,920
and use it to kill Fire Immortal?

294
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,640
You are so wise, my Lord.

295
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
We can take this good chance

296
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,160
to get justice for the two princes.

297
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,640
In the past, with the Fire Immortal,

298
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,440
the Heaven Realm made discreet remarks on Demon Realm,

299
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
attempting to impose their artificial rules

300
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,600
on us

301
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,560
and disturbing us.

302
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,640
Even if not for the sake of

303
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,800
my miserable sons,

304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,960
I won’t make any compromise again.

305
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,240
You have always been reliable.

306
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
This matter is left up to you.

307
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,920
Remember.

308
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,040
Don’t let

309
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,200
King of Bian City, the old guy know about our plan.

310
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes, my Lord.

311
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Xu Feng,

312
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,040
I must take revenge on you for my sons.

313
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,040
My sons,

314
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,000
I want to kill Fire Immortal and Qiong Qi

315
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,760
to take revenge for you.

316
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Your Majesty.

317
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,960
Look.

318
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,800
So this is Mieling Arrow
made from your blood and bones.

319
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,640
How to use it?

321
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,680
Shoot the arrow with strong power.

322
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,440
It can kill all living beings,

323
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,120
destroying their souls.

324
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,360
And they will be dead forever.

325
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,680
Very good.

326
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,040
I have already told Fairy Yuan about this.

327
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,360
Take actions without any worries.

328
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,080
If Jin Mi, the sprite returns to the Heaven Realm.

330
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,560
It will be your fault.

331
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

332
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,880
I must have been bewitched.

333
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
How come I took such a risk

334
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,040
to treat him with the precious herb.

335
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,000
Is it the so-called conciseness of doctors?

336
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Leave t it. Leave it.

337
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,040
Since you are the first patient

338
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
that I have taken care of in person

339
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,600
I did this for you as a greeting gift.

340
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Use my grape to remove the bitterness.

341
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
Is it sweet?

342
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
It is very sweet, right?

343
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,120
It seems that it’s very sweet.

344
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
So sour.

345
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Extremely sour. It’s not sweet at all.

346
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
Liar.

347
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,800
How dare you to tease me.

348
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
I like sour food.

349
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,560
You turn out to be a jealous man.

350
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Your wife will be unlucky.

351
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,760
When will I recover?

352
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,400
Within half a mouth, you will recover completely.

353
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,960
You look young, and may I have your age?

354
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,160
Life in the mountains is slower than that in outside world.

355
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,160
The world has changed a lot.

356
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,800
Actually I am not so young apparently.

357
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
Since the moment when I can keep a record of things,

358
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
I have learned these mysterious

359
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,160
and ambiguous words.

360
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,160
Otherwise, how can I build my authority
among the people of my family,

361
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,640
including the old ones

362
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,640
and the young ones.

363
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,280
Judging from your appearance, you are of my age.

364
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,280
But in terms of skills,

365
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,560
you can call me master.

366
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
She is young,

367
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,840
but her words and manners are inconsistent with her age.

368
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
Is she really a wise person?

369
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
Or is she just bluffing?

370
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
Why do you provoke those soldiers?

371
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
They are from Liangguo.

372
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,040
They are from Liangguo.

373
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
So what?

374
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
They invade my country and took women and kids

375
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,280
They have done so many misdeeds.
We all have the right to punish them.

376
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,040
Your have a great mind.

377
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,360
Why didn’t you join the army?

378
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,880
Why are you a bandit instead?

379
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
I got it.

380
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,600
The world is in chaos.

381
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Soldiers and bandits are family.

382
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,640
I got it. Got it.

383
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,240
You are admirable.

384
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
I’m not kidding.

385
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Why is this bandit

386
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,080
so bad-tempered?

387
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,080
Everything was OK just now.

388
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
But now he suddenly becomes angry

389
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,960
and ignore me again.

390
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Your face is so dark, like a crow.

391
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,320
Well, you really look like crow.

392
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,720
I will call you crow from now on.

393
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,680
Crow.

394
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,680
Crow.

395
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Why did you save my life?

396
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Don't talk about the conciseness of doctors.

397
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
I don’t believe it at all.

398
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,280
You look handsome.

399
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,040
You should thank your parents,

400
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
endowing you with such good look.

401
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
I won't feel bad

402
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
about using those precious herbs to treat you.

403
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,880
It’s the rule of survival.
The doctors are just following the rule.

404
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,400
The person chosen by the God will be blessed.

405
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
Don’t forget to share the bless with people in need.

406
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,720
Hundreds of people died,

407
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,960
making the mountain smelly.

408
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,560
Only you survived.

409
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
Who else should I pick?

410
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
You were picked by me.

411
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,080
So you might as well try the medicine for me,

412
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
which can be regarded as a bless
you give us Saint Doctor Family.

413
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Other people use hands to play chess,

414
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,400
but we use them to write and chat.

415
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
I have no time to chat with you now.

416
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,200
I’m going to go down the mountain

417
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,200
and buy some food.

418
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,200
See you.

419
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,840
Don’t worry.

420
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,480
I will manage to find some clothes that fit you.

421
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,640
But you look pretty

422
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,160
in dress for females.

423
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,040
Village girl.

424
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Your Highness.

425
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,880
Many days has passed.

426
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Haven’t you got in touch with His Majesty?

427
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Shence House has sent out twelve teams of soldiers

428
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
to every county to look for His Majesty secretly.

429
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
It won’t work by just sending twelve teams of hidden guards.

430
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
Why not send a larger troop?

431
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,480
At the moment, the soldiers of Lingguo are stationing
at the border, attempting to invade our country.

432
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
During this time of troubles, people are in panic.

433
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
The dukes negotiated and has reach an agreement

434
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,560
that this matter should be handled secretly.

435
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,320
The situation is very urgent now.

436
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,320
If something bad happened to my cousin,

437
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,800
who can take the responsibility?

438
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,600
I will devote my life to His Majesty.

439
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,800
Here is a message.

440
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,680
It’s very urgent, General Qin.

441
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,320
What is it?

442
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
According to the messengers, His Majesty and his followers

443
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,440
were attacked by the soldiers of Liangguo
at the Luoye Moutain ten days ago.

444
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,760
Did they see His Majesty?

445
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,040
His Majesty is missing.

446
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
All the guards died.

447
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
All of them die for their duty.

448
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,800
How many enemy soldiers did they encounter?

449
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
There about two hundred bodies
of the enemy soldier in the mountains.

450
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,120
They all were killed.

451
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,400
On the day when His Majesty went hunting,

452
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
he just took 18 guards,

453
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,800
who weren’t well armed.

454
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,400
I am going to discuss this with dad and find a solution.

455
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,200
Your Highness.

456
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
You haven’t got married yet.
How come you say this?

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,480
Where’s your manner?

458
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I have been engaged with him for 18 years.

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,920
The engagement

460
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,480
was made by the past king.

461
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
People of Huaiwu know about this.
Nobody dares to laugh at me.

462
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,440
I have already consider myself

463
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,080
as a member of the Palace of King Yi.

464
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,920
I will live and die with him.

465
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,200
If he is fine, it will be great.

466
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
If he dies,

467
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,360
I am will be his widow.

468
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
I’m serious.

469
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,800
I just have one daughter, you,

470
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,280
you hurt my feelings so much by saying like this.

471
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,560
I’m not filial. Sorry to make you sad, dad.

472
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,480
I said like this just to make you know

473
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
that I will do anything

474
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,520
for my cousin.

475
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,160
I understand.

476
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,680
I understand all.

477
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,280
Alright.

478
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,360
Stand up.

479
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Calm down.

480
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
I also just heard the news,

481
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,720
and discussed it with grand preceptors

482
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,520
We have both internal and external troubles.

483
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,280
So we must find a perfect solution..

484
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Speed is the soldier’s asset.

485
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
I will wait until the mid-night.

486
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,560
If you still can't find a solution.

487
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,440
I took my Phoenix Troop first

488
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,680
to look for him in the Luoye Mountain.

489
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,720
Don’t take risk.

490
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,200
I will handle this.

491
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Don’t not worry.

492
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,280
I will persuade the grand preceptors

493
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,520
to take His Majesty back.

494
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
Thank you, daddy.

495
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,680
I am waiting for your news.

496
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,880
Why?

497
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,440
You are deaf and dumb.

498
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,480
But you have sound hands and legs.

499
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,200
Why do you make me help you get changed?

500
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
Do the doctors in the outside world

501
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
have the duty of help patients get changed?

502
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,480
Who made the rule?

503
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
Hurry.

504
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
Help me get changed.

505
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,680
I, a Saint Girl

506
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,480
am reduced to be your servant.

507
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,800
It’s too bad.

508
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
The soldiers of Liangguo

509
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,920
are so useless.

510
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,960
They, so many of them couldn’t even

511
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,040
handle King Yi.

512
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
We even need to cope with the aftermath for them.

513
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,560
You lead some soldiers to search around Luoye Mountain.

514
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,840
Take his dead body.

515
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,440
Yes.

516
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
These are good herbs that can cool the blood, stop bleeding,

517
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,800
remove blood stasis and expel pus.

518
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,280
The juice of the herbs penetrates from the pores of your hands.

519
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,280
It can address both the symptoms
and the root causes, which is very effective.

520
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,160
Finally I have someone to help me wash these

521
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,360
stinging herbs.

522
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,240
The white powders are for external application.

523
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,440
She always covers her face with the veil.

524
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,120
She has profound medical skills,
and deals with affairs wisely.

525
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,680
Sometimes she fails to master the worldly wisdom.

526
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,920
Is she from the Saint Doctor Family?

527
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,040
This is not what a gentleman should do.

528
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,960
Since she saved me, she won’t hurt me.

529
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
Everyone has something embarrassing to mention.

530
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,800
She will let me see her face

531
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
when she is wiling to.

532
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
Sorry to have troubled you these days.

533
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,440
Take a good rest.

534
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,320
Although he is a bandit who killed many people.

535
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,320
But I find he’s not a bad guy

536
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,440
during these days of being together.

537
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,080
He’s very disciplined.

538
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
So being a bandit is not what he desires.

539
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
In troubled times, everyone
has his or her own difficulties.

540
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
I shouldn’t tease him anymore.

541
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
I should provide medical treatment to him.

542
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,160
Girl, look at our wind chime.

543
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,120
And this one.

544
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,600
Look. It’s so beautiful.

545
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,680
Buy one.

546
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,800
He uses invisibility spell even on the street.

547
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,800
So sneaky

548
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,080
Is he a hidden guard?

549
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,400
Declare that you will reward
your hidden guards and demons

550
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,320
if they arrest and kill the remaining
member of Mieling Family.

551
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
Search for the Mieling Arrow.

552
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,600
I don’t know how many members of Mieling Family are still alive,

553
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
and how many Mieling Arrows are existing.

554
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,120
Do you know about this, my Lord?

555
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,480
Take them all back.

556
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,040
You don’t have to take the first one back.

557
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,680
Take it and use it to kill Xu Feng in the Human Realm.

558
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,720
If you catch the living members of Mieling Family

559
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,960
or know where they are,

560
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,560
Tell me immediately.

561
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,920
Mu Ci.

562
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,240
Xu Feng

563
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,480
Yes.

564
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
If this news leaks out...

565
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
Trespassing my house

566
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,360
and eavesdropping

567
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,520
are the manners of your family?

568
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
Kill me if you wants. Don’t mention my father.

569
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
I will kill you.

570
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,120
And I will also kill your father.

571
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,320
I think you are also scheming against the Demon Lord.

572
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,600
Hiding from the Demon Lord,

573
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,880
you secretly are looking for Mieling Arrow
and members of Mieling Family.

574
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
Your wide ambitions

575
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,440
are so obvious.

576
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
Kill her.

577
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,000
Liu Ying has repeatedly interfered with me.

578
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,960
Transmit my order.

579
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,440
Say it’s Demon Lord’s requirement.

580
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,600
Kill

581
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,000
Liu Ying, who is from Bian City.

582
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,120
Yes, my Lord.
