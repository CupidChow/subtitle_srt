1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 56"

3
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,140
You are really here, my Lord.

4
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,840
What’s up?

5
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,060
After the things that happened
at the Cave of Jiu Ying,

6
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,340
you have been avoiding meeting me.

7
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,040
I’m afraid that

8
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,740
you would believe what Jin Mi said again

9
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,640
and misunderstand me.

10
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,800
She fooled me several times.

11
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,920
How is it possible that I would believe her again?

12
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,940
In these days,

13
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,580
I have been very busy with
the affairs of Demon Realm.

14
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,400
I didn’t avoid meeting you.

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,840
Don’t worry.

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,160
Xu Feng,

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,360
if Heavenly Emperor hadn’t come

18
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,120
would you kill Jin Mi?

19
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
Definitely.

20
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,920
That's good.

21
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,060
Would I really kill her?

22
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,840
The medicine soup of Floral Realm is really nutritious.

23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,900
Within two days,

24
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,860
my magic power will be recovered.

25
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Yan You.

26
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,400
I was wondering who it was.

27
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,200
It turns out to be you, little Lian Qiao.

28
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
I am sorry.

29
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,220
I am here to give you the medicine.

30
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,100
I didn’t peek at you when you were bathing.

31
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,520
You didn’t?

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,900
Why is your face burning like this?

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,180
My face is always like this.

34
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,860
Your medicine soup has been spilled.

35
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,460
How can I drink it?

36
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,700
I’ll cook one more bowl of medicine soup for you.

37
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Why is my face so hot?

38
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,960
My heart is beating so fast.

39
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,300
Have I got a weird disease?

40
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,460
Your Highness.

41
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,140
Mu Ci.

42
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,520
Your Highness.

43
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,100
I know

44
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,760
you have always been fond of Liu Ying.

45
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,240
You can even sacrifice your life for her.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
So

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,680
you will definitely make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,740
Right?

49
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,780
Let go of her.

50
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,020
When you make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully,

51
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,440
I will naturally let you go.

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
No way.

53
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,160
I’m wondering

54
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,880
how many stabs Princess of Bian City can bear?

55
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,720
Your Highness.

56
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,580
Don't promise him.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,060
Your Highness.

58
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,260
No.

59
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,640
I’ll make it.

60
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,300
I’ll make it.

61
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,220
That’s good.

62
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,640
When you make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully,

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,500
I will let you go.

64
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,160
My Lord.

65
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,460
Mu Ci’ s magic power is so weak

66
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,420
that he can’t even see through my shape-shift magic.

67
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,300
Can he make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow successfully?

68
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,900
Liu Ying

69
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,380
is his weakness.

70
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,280
I believe he will make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,380
even if he may die for it.

72
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,920
My Lord, Water Immortal wants to meet you.

73
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,140
Please punish me, my Lord.

74
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,940
You are not to blame.

75
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,720
Even I have to regard Water Immortal

76
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
with reverence.

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
You may go.

78
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,480
Yes, my Lord.

79
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,740
What?

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,220
Water Immortal, are you blaming me

81
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,360
for not having given you a hearty welcome?

82
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,420
So you disdain to talk to me.

83
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,040
Xu Feng.

84
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,640
Water Immortal, you are so brave.

85
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
You came here on your own.

86
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,600
And you addressed me disrespectfully by name.

87
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,140
Aren’t you afraid that you may be unable to go back?

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,060
Or

89
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,540
you bet I don't dare to kill you?

90
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,160
I was wrong, phoenix.

91
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,560
I’m sorry.

92
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,240
I know that I was wrong.

93
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,520
You didn’t kill my dad.

94
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,460
I got you wrong.

95
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,880
Sorry, phoenix.

96
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,980
Could you let me explain?

97
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,080
Dreams about what one saw.

98
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,960
I went to the Pixiang Hall.

99
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,160
I went there to check the documents

100
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,520
about the dreams eaten records of Beast of Dreams.

101
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,420
But when I got there,

102
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,620
I saw your dream about what you saw.

103
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
That dream is about what
happened on the day my dad died.

104
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,160
At that time, all the evidences,

105
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,520
All the evidences showed that you were the murderer.

106
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,180
I had no choice but to believe it, phoenix.

107
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,540
Half an year later, when I woke up,

108
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,060
I found that someone had cheated in those evidences.

109
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,160
So I realized that I had done you wrong.

110
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,020
But it was too late at the time.

111
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,480
Phoenix,

112
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
I’m sorry.

113
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,100
I’m really sorry.

114
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,220
What a nice play!

115
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,820
Last time,

116
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,860
You teamed up with Run Yu,

117
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,300
killing me by using only a strand of hair

118
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,800
and gaining a complete victory.

119
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Now I just become Demon Lord.

120
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,360
And you appear and play the same trick again.

121
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,120
Do you two really think I’m so stupid

122
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,620
that I would fall in the same place twice?

123
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Phoenix,

124
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,180
let me explain.

125
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,900
OK. I won’t touch you.

126
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,980
But please believe me.

127
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,560
It’s not true. You got me wrong.

128
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
It’s Sui He.

129
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,220
Sui He can use Glazed Pure Fire.

130
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,020
Do you know this?

131
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,640
She can use Glazed Pure Fire.

132
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,340
You are lying.

133
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,500
No, I’m not.

134
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,580
To make your arguments convincing,
you have to speak on good grounds.

135
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,640
You stabbed me in the back.

136
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,480
But now you are claiming
that it’s someone else’ s fault.

137
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,540
It’s really a good play.

138
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,560
Lord Puchi is the witness.

139
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,160
Lord Puchi is the witness.

140
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,000
I went to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

141
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,540
for Lord Puchi.

142
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,340
He was injured because of Sui He.

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,160
It was Sui He who hurt him with Glazed Pure Fire.

144
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,760
Do you know about this, phoenix?

145
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,860
Could you listen to me?

146
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,940
Could you believe me?

147
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,680
Phoenix, I beg you.

148
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,500
Please believe me. OK?

149
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
When I was dying,

150
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,260
It’s Sui He who saved me.

151
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
When I had nothing to my name,

152
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,100
it’s Sui He who accompanied me.

153
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,500
In terms of viciousness,

154
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Sui He cannot compare with you.

155
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,700
I know.

156
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,300
I know.

157
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,680
I was wrong.

158
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,460
I was wrong.

159
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,780
I’m sorry, phoenix.

160
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,380
But,

161
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,500
but I am willing to bear

162
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,920
all the retributions.

163
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,760
I just want to tell you

164
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,500
that Sui He is not the kind of person you think.

165
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,520
She is not the kind of person she appears to be.

166
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,620
She admitted to me

167
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,540
that she killed my dad

168
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,340
and shifted the blame on you.

169
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,660
She is the culprit.

170
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,600
She’s wicked.

171
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,100
She is not the kind of person she appears to be.

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,460
Phoenix, please believe me.

173
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,620
Thank you for reminding me, Water Immortal.

174
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,620
If without the comparison today,

175
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,260
I wouldn’t realize

176
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,940
how precious Sui He is to me.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Get out of here,

178
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,860
before I change my mind.

179
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,540
I’m really afraid that I can’t help

180
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,320
but kill you.

181
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,400
Phoenix.

182
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Phoenix.

183
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,060
<i>With a pot of wine </i>

184
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,300
<i>and dust all over mu body</i>

185
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,500
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

186
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,260
Ying.

187
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,640
Father.

188
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,200
Have you found him?

189
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
I searched the whole Demon Realm,

190
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,200
but I couldn’t find him.

191
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Maybe he is still worried

192
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,900
that he would be a burden for you.

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,620
But

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,980
we agreed that we would get married
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

195
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,840
He wouldn’t leave without saying goodbye.

196
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Getting married?

197
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,360
How could you hide this from me?

198
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,520
We made this decision hastily.

199
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,580
It’s my fault that I didn’t tell you before.

200
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,540
Spirit-Vanishing Family hasn’t got its due justice.

201
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
Mu Ci is weak.

202
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,080
Originally we just wanted you and Xu Feng

203
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,200
as the witnesses on our wedding.

204
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,540
I just want to stay with him peacefully
for the rest several years.

205
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,840
You are really getting more and more independent.

206
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,940
How do you know that
I will agree with you on this matter?

207
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,520
I know you, father.

208
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,260
Let's go.

209
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,940
I’m going to look for him with you.

210
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,000
The sixth day of the sixth lunar month

211
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,740
You can’t defeat me nor kill me.

212
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
You must be very angry. Right?

213
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,600
It’s not strange.

214
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,840
Xu Feng doesn’t want you anymore.

215
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Now he just believes me.

216
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,160
Feeling pain, right?

217
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,660
Blame yourself.

218
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,220
You were engaged with Run Yu.

219
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,620
But you still came to hang around Xu Feng.

220
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,360
So I had to find a way to separate you two.

221
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,140
Such being the case,

222
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,520
the one who caused your dad’s death

223
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,260
is you.

224
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,520
What?

225
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,520
You want to fight in the Yujiang Palace?

226
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,780
Okay.

227
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,780
Go ahead.

228
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,680
Kill me.

229
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,920
And let Xu Feng save me again.

230
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,600
I’m wondering if you can make him love you again.

231
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
It seems that you won’t get satisfied.

232
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
I’m here not to kill you.

233
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,120
I’m here to tell you

234
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,420
I will tell everyone the truth

235
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,320
that you are the murderer

236
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,620
and let you clear Xu Feng’ s name.

237
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,360
I won't let you stay with Xu Feng

238
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,540
and hurt him.

239
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,800
Hurt him?

240
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,880
I’m telling you,

241
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,220
it’s the thing that I will never do.

242
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,560
This is where we are different.

243
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
For Xu Feng,

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,660
I can sacrifice everything

245
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,280
including myself.

246
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,000
But you,

247
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,900
when others play a little trick,

248
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,200
you would kill him.

249
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,300
You don’t deserve him at all.

250
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,320
Mu Ci,

251
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,020
you will definitely come
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

252
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,560
Right?

253
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,320
Your Highness,

254
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,640
I’ll keep our appointment

255
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,840
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

256
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,060
Little one,

257
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,260
you have been sitting here for one day.

258
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,040
What happened to you?

259
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,060
Sui He is right.

260
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,660
I’m to blame.

261
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,020
Because of me, my dad

262
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,380
and auntie Lin Xiu died.

263
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,320
And I killed Xu Feng mistakenly.

264
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,560
I don't deserve his love at all.

265
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,060
What are you talking about?

266
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,980
The one who is sinful

267
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,580
is the person who killed
Wind Immortal and Water Immortal.

268
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,000
It has nothing to do with you.

269
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,740
I was wrong in that I didn’t believe him.

270
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,000
And he

271
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,140
will never believe me again.

272
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,620
Little one.

273
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Oh no.

274
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,900
The flowers of our Floral Realm are all gone.

275
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,040
How?

276
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,200
Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.

277
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,380
Has he figured it out ?

278
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,180
Jin Mi.

279
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,960
Little one.

280
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,640
-Jin Mi.
-Little one.

281
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,140
Where are you going?

282
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
Xu Feng.

283
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,120
Is this gift

284
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,340
beautiful?

285
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
Yes, it is.

286
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,420
I have never expected that

287
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,780
the beautiful scenery would appear in Demon Realm.

288
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,080
I can't believe my eyes.

289
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,500
Because of the affairs of Demon Realm

290
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,200
I have neglected you these days.

291
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,300
This gift is a compensation for you.

292
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,300
Xu Feng,

293
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,220
you are very considerate.

294
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,100
Here you are.

295
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,860
What’s its name?

296
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,020
It’s so beautiful.

297
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,320
Phoenix flower.

298
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,720
Phoenix flower?

299
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,740
Phoenix,

300
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,100
I’ll give you one piece of my real body,

301
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,420
offering you a moment of
spring flowers and autumn fruits.

302
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,860
I made a little gadget

303
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,440
for you.

304
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,620
What is it?

305
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,380
It is called Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.

306
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,720
Put it in your heart,

307
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,360
use magic power to motivate it,

308
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,760
and you will be able to create a beautiful scenery
of spring flowers and autumn fruits.

309
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,140
It’s uneatable.

310
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,140
And it can’t be used as a weapon.

311
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,420
It’s useless.

312
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,440
You are right.

313
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,440
OK.

314
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,360
Then I’ll take it back and turn it into a weapon.

315
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,460
I’ll put it in my soul.

316
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,760
And I promise I will take good care of it.

317
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,040
Jin Mi.

318
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
The scenery of blossom in the spring
and yield in the autumn is really very beautiful.

319
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,360
Sorry to have bothered you

320
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,720
to rack your brains to earn my affection and trust

321
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,640
in order to help Run Yu become Heavenly Emperor.

322
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,320
Xu Feng,

323
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,380
you are the sun in summer,

324
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,120
and I’m am the frost and snow in winter.

325
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,040
But now

326
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,640
is it really impossible to
make the four season complete?

327
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,500
Do you like this scenery?

328
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,900
Sui He,

329
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,040
the 15th day of next lunar month is an auspicious day.

330
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,920
Let's hold our wedding on that day.

331
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,800
Are you serious?

332
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,180
Xu Feng, do you know that

333
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,660
this is one piece of my real body?

334
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,300
Do you know that

335
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,100
this woman killed my father?

336
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,540
<i>From the love letter,</i>

337
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,180
<i>I find the places
where we will meet in each life.</i>

338
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,100
<i>I will wait for you there</i>

339
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,740
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>

340
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,540
<i>From the love letter, </i>

341
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>I find the places
where we will fall in love in each life.</i>

342
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,600
The gift given by you

343
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,900
is really extraordinary.

344
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,760
I have made the best use of it.

345
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,220
Now I should give it back to you.

346
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,860
<i>I plant a red lotus </i>

347
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,980
<i>to make the days filled with fragrance.</i>

348
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,420
<i>From the love letter, </i>

349
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,220
<i>I find the places
where we will fall in love in each life.</i>

350
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,060
<i>I will sing there,</i>

351
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,980
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

352
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,760
Phoenix,

353
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,660
I do love you.

354
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,260
I love you.

355
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
I remember very clearly

356
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,460
the two words you gave me

357
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,620
when I was dying

358
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,220
—never ever.

359
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,340
I have always regarded
these two words as a golden rule.

360
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,460
I bear them in my mind firmly.

361
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,440
I don’t dare to

362
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,440
to forget them.

363
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,440
Because I ate Yun Elixir,

364
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,480
Since my childhood,

365
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,880
I had always been immune from romantic love.

366
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,600
At that time, I didn't know

367
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
anything about love.

368
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,320
Yun Elixir.

369
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,540
This object you make up sounds very unique.

370
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,940
From now on,

371
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,340
if you say again that you love me,

372
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,220
I will kill you immediately.

373
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,560
I will cut a slice of you

374
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,980
every time you say it.

375
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,380
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

376
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,740
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

377
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,180
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

378
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,700
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

379
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,260
<i>The memory haunts me,</i>

380
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,540
<i>making me grieved.</i>

381
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,580
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>

382
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,740
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>

383
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,300
<i>With a pot of wine </i>

384
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,020
<i>and dust all over my body</i>

385
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,120
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

386
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,640
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

387
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,760
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

388
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,380
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

389
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,780
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

390
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,940
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

391
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,820
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

392
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,620
<i>The memory haunts me, </i>

393
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,380
<i>making me grieved.</i>

394
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,300
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>

395
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,940
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>

396
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
It turns out to be an awesome weapon.

397
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,160
It can’t hurt others.

398
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
But it can hurt myself

399
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,600
with only one blow.

400
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,960
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

401
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,180
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

402
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,720
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

403
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,800
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

404
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,420
Mi.

405
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,340
Mi.

406
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,440
I know that you are very upset.

407
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,280
You can't forget him.

408
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,920
But Mi,

409
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,360
you two can't be together again.

410
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,180
Don't go to see him anymore.

411
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,000
Let go of him.

412
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,660
And let go of yourself.

413
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,400
Okay?

414
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,580
I have no right to try to persuade you.

415
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,240
I’m just like you.

416
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,840
We two are idiots.

417
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,020
Where am I?

418
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,200
Who...

419
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,300
Who am I?

420
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,540
The sixth day of the sixth lunar month...

421
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,000
Who am I?

422
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
Who is she?

423
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,400
How is it going?

424
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,340
My Lord.

425
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,780
It seems that Mu Ci is dying.

426
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,160
I think his magic power has been exhausted.

427
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,120
Then give him some power

428
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,420
and let him continue making the arrow.

429
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,840
If you can’t make Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

430
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,820
your Liu Ying

431
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,060
will be killed like this.

432
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,940
Liu Ying.

433
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,000
Liu Ying.

434
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,000
Mu Ci,

435
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,660
where are you exactly?

436
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,520
You promised me

437
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,560
that you would let me accompany you
to the end of your life.

438
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,280
Where are you?

439
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,320
Nether Fury.

440
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,260
How come?

441
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,000
Mu Ci,

442
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,780
where are you?

443
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,800
What are you doing?

444
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,060
Congratulations, Your Highness,
for you are going to become Demon Empress.

445
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You all may get up off your knees.

446
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
Thanks, Your Highness.

447
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,660
The wedding day is coming soon.

448
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,200
I have to bother you a lot.

449
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,140
Please be sure to make
the wedding a grand event.

450
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,220
I won’t treat you badly.

451
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,560
Yes, Your Highness.

452
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,280
The wedding of me and my Lord

453
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,840
is a joyous event happening
once in a blue moon in Demon Realm.

454
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,680
Proclaim this news to the public

455
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,600
especially to Heaven Realm and Floral Realm.

456
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,640
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,840
You may go.

458
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,520
Yes, Your Highness.

459
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,760
Water Immortal got injured badly.

460
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,820
With me being here,

461
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,540
she will be fine.

462
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,660
Your Majesty,

463
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,840
you just care about Water Immortal.

464
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,900
Have you ever cared about yourself?

465
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,300
You can get hurt.

466
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,020
Your heart may ache.

467
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,680
My heart

468
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,720
has already been given to her.

469
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,440
So it can’t ache anymore.

470
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,840
Your Majesty, if one day

471
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,860
your magic power is exhausted,

472
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,020
who

473
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
will feel sorry for you?

474
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
As long as I can stand behind her,

475
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,240
watch her,

476
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,640
and protect her,

477
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,140
I will feel satisfied

478
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,220
even if my magic power is exhausted.

479
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,400
Maybe

480
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,500
she will change her mind.

481
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,880
I’m sorry,

482
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,780
Fish Fairy.

483
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,300
How come these flowers reappear?

484
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,180
Mr. Hu shouldn’t

485
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,360
have made a fuss over nothing

486
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,560
and bothered Chief Peony.

487
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,120
Yan You.

488
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,040
Yan You.

489
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,580
Where is he?

490
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,820
It can’t be that he has left as he has
almost recovered completely, can it?

491
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,880
It’s Jin Mi's book.

492
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,620
According to this book,

493
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,860
if one blushes and his or her heart beats fast,

494
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,960
he or she must start to understand love.

495
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
Why is my face so hot?

496
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,340
Why is my heart beating so fast?

497
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,720
Jin Mi has gone back to Heaven Realm again.

498
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,640
And Mr. Hu has been nowhere in sight these days.

499
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,680
Now Yan You is also gone.

500
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,080
I don’t have anyone to talk to.

501
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,000
Who can remove my confusion?

502
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,400
Little Lian Qiao, what’s your confusion?

503
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,000
Tell me about it.

504
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,940
Let’s see if I can help you.

505
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,920
It turns out that you like reading this book, too.

506
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,200
So your confusion

507
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,920
must be about romantic love. Right?

508
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,320
Don't be shy.

509
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,960
About romantic love,

510
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,000
I know a lot.

511
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,220
If you have any confusion, let me know.

512
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,820
Not me.

513
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,300
It’s my friend

514
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,940
Every time she sees a man,

515
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,540
she blushes and her heart beats fast.

516
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,860
But she’s very happy.

517
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,140
When she can’t see him,

518
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,340
she misses him.

519
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,800
According to what is mentioned in this book,

520
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
does she start to understand love?

521
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,180
That's right.

522
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,220
Your friend has started to understand love.

523
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,540
Then what should she do?

524
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,640
What?

525
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,000
She should express her affection to him.

526
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,500
Express her affection to him?

527
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,920
Yes.

528
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,340
You see, if you like a person,

529
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,640
you must want to stay with him every day. Right?

530
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,240
So you have to be brave
and express your affection to him.

531
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,400
Let me tell you.

532
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,840
Your friend is a girl.

533
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,340
If a girl takes the initiative to express
her affection to the person she likes,

534
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,740
she will be most likely to succeed.

535
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,000
Really?

536
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,820
Of course.

537
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,000
I like you.

538
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,160
Well,

539
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,200
I know that I’m very charming.

540
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
But you shouldn’t like me.

541
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,700
Why not?

542
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,820
Because

543
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,600
I...

544
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,020
I don’t like you.

545
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,920
But you said

546
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,520
if a girl takes the initiative to express
her affection to the person she likes,

547
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,380
she will be most likely to succeed.

548
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,420
That’s true.

549
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,920
But there are still a few chances

550
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,460
of failure.

551
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,780
We don’t match each other.

552
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,180
You should forget me as early as possible.

553
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,420
I have something at hand.

554
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,220
I’ve got to go now.

555
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,260
See you. See you.

556
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,800
I just came back from the hardship experience.

557
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,140
Could you please hurry up?

558
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,420
At your rate,

559
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,740
we can’t finish this game within three days.

560
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,360
Give me some more time to think about it.

561
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,140
When I decide where this piece I should place,

562
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,420
maybe I will be on my way to win this game.

563
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,920
You said this two hours ago.

564
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,080
Today I must be out of my mind so that

565
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,560
I would agree to play this game with you.

566
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,100
Mister Immortal,

567
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,500
here is the wedding invitation
card from Demon Realm.

568
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,480
Is it the Demon Lord’s wedding invitation card?

569
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,700
Xu Feng is not clear-minded.

570
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,200
He’s going to marry Sui He. Shocking!

571
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,020
I’m not in the mood to play it now.

572
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,400
It seems that there will be
a big disaster in the six realms.

573
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,660
What do you mean?

574
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,960
I can’t tell you. I can’t tell you.

575
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,080
Yuan Ji,

576
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,160
we are close friends.

577
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,680
You can tell me everything.

578
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,500
Tell me about it.

579
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,220
This is beyond our control.

580
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,100
Everything has been doomed.

581
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,540
We can’t stop it.
