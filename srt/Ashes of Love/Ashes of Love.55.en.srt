"Cave of Jiu Ying"

4
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,120
There is really someone
trespassing the Cave of Jiu Ying.

5
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,700
Go and report to Princess Sui He.

6
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,300
OK.

7
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,320
Little one, let me see where you are.

8
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,760
Let me see where you are.

9
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
Little one.

10
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,960
Don't sway. Don't sway.

11
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,140
You are making me dizzy.

12
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,900
Let me see where you are now.

13
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,020
Don’ sway your hands.

14
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,000
Little one, you are so clever

15
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,480
that you make me help you in this way.

16
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
Mr. Hu,

17
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
this underground palace is so big.

18
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,200
Where is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying?

19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,460
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

20
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,900
is in the Cave of Jiu Ying,

21
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,600
which is the innermost part
of the underground palace.

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Yes.

23
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,860
That’s the right path.

24
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,060
Go along this path.

25
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,360
Go straight to the inside.

26
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,160
Move along.

27
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,160
Move along. Move along.

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,900
Move along. Move along. Move along.

29
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,840
Move along. Move along.

30
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
You are at the door now, right?

31
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,180
That’s the door.

32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,160
Outside the door is the ward.

33
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,960
The fire of supreme yang

34
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,600
or the water of supreme yin can break it.

35
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,220
Little one,

36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,100
you have only one hour.

37
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,220
Hurry up.

38
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,160
Otherwise, you will be in danger.

39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,180
It’s here.

40
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,420
The Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is in the cave.

41
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,220
Open it.

42
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,720
OK.

43
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,260
Little one, time is running out.

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,100
Little one.

45
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,660
Break the ward.

46
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,460
OK.

47
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,120
I guessed you would come here
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

48
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
in order to save Yan You.

49
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,340
Jin Mi,

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,340
Today, I will

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,180
let you die here.

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,000
My Lord,

53
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,440
the soldiers reported

54
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,500
they saw Water Immortal and Princess Sui He

55
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,920
enter the underground palace one after another.

56
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,460
Little one.

57
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,420
Hurry. Let me check.

58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,980
The Wall of Jiu Ying.

59
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,460
That's it.

60
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,180
It has nine eyes.

61
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,100
That red one is the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,640
Take the Internal Dan before it wakes up.

63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,200
Otherwise, you will be in danger.

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
Got it.

65
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,660
Red...

66
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,940
Which one is red?

67
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,620
What?

68
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
You can't even tell which one is red?

69
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't piss me off. OK?

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,820
You have only one chance.

71
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,040
You must get the real Internal Dan.

72
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,680
Otherwise,

73
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,640
you will be swallowed up by the soul of Jiu Ying.

74
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,900
Hurry up.

75
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:11,860
Time is almost up.

76
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,520
I know,

77
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,540
but I don't know which one is red.

78
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,700
Let me check for you. Let me check for you.

79
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,600
Mr. Hu,

80
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,340
check which eye is red for me.

81
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,820
I was dazzled

82
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,700
by a shiny thing just now.

83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
I can't see anything clearly now.

84
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,320
What?

85
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Dear, I have been trapped here
for thousands of years.

86
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,780
Please help me out.

87
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,700
Another one who wants to take my Internal Dan?

88
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,060
You are bringing about your own destruction.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,920
Why are there always some daredevil people?

90
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,940
You have one. I have one.

91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,940
Guess where the Internal Dan is?

92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,700
Little one,

93
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,740
Jiu Ying has been awake.

94
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,900
Get out immediately.

95
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
Jin Mi, get out.

96
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
Get out immediately.

97
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,700
The Internal Dan is its vital part.

98
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,400
When in danger,

99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,020
its reaction must be the most obvious.

100
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
I found it.

101
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
No one can take away my Internal Dan.

102
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,920
How do you know

103
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,800
that the green one is my real Internal Dan?

104
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,320
Shut up!

105
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,820
The green one is not my Internal Dan.

106
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,180
Everyone knows that the red one is my Internal Dan.

107
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,320
If you take the wrong one,

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,920
you will be inhaled to my soul

109
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,600
and become one part of me.

110
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,740
Are you really going to take the risk?

111
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Are you really going to take the risk?

112
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,900
Are you really going to take the risk?

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,980
Are you really going to take the risk?

114
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,920
Are you really going to take the risk?

115
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
Are you really going to take the risk?

116
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,660
Are you really going to take the risk?

117
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Are you really going to take the risk?

118
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,540
Are you really going to take the risk?

119
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,240
Mr. Hu,

120
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,480
did you see it?

121
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I found it.

122
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,940
It’s the red Internal Dan.

123
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,060
Red?

124
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,060
Is it true that

125
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,460
I have become color-blinded?

126
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,780
I will talk with you later.

127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
It is a surprise that you got it.

128
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,620
It seems that I underestimated your ability.

129
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,860
What are you doing here?

130
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,940
Give me the Internal Dan, right now.

131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,440
What do you want it for?

132
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
I won’t let you get the things

133
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,840
you want.

134
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,560
OK.

135
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,040
I’ll give it to you.

136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,960
Take it.

137
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,220
Sui He, get out of my way.

138
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,620
Good birds never stand in the way.

139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,820
I’ll take this chance to kill her

140
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
and remove the cause of future troubles.

141
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,940
How come you can use Glazed Pure Fire?

142
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,980
Auntie.

143
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
I have given you all of my power.

144
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,980
With Glazed Pure Fire,

145
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,820
you must revive Bird Family

146
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,660
and help my son, Xu Feng
to become Heavenly Emperor.

147
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,100
It’s worthwhile for me to have
curried favour with you for so many years.

148
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Now I have so much magic power.

149
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,440
I wonder who dares to stand in my way.

150
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,220
Tell me.

151
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,780
Did you,

152
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,900
Did you kill my daddy?

153
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,820
Yes, I did. So what?

154
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,480
I also know that Xu Feng was saved by you.

155
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,400
But now he thinks it’s me who saved him.

156
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,840
Jin Mi,

157
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,860
it’s impossible for you and Xu Feng
to be together again.

158
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,100
Today

159
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,820
I’ll take revenge for my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.

160
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,300
It’s her.

161
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,400
It’s her who killed my daddy.

162
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,420
My Lord, help me.

163
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,560
Little one.

164
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,600
What the hell is this?

165
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,040
It’s as unreliable as Honghong at critical moment.

166
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
Your Majesty.

167
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,160
Why do you look so flurried?

168
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,880
Where is Mi?

169
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,500
Little one has gone to the
underground palace of Demon Realm.

170
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,520
After she took the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,

171
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,680
I lost contact with her suddenly.

172
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,680
I don’t know what’s going on now.

173
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,820
She has already admitted

174
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,060
she killed my daddy and auntie Lin Xiu.

175
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,560
Phoenix,

176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
we both were cheated by her.

177
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
Nonsense!

178
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,260
If I could kill the past Water Immortal,

179
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,980
I wouldn’t have been hit by you.

180
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,360
You used Glazed Pure Fire just now.

181
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,500
It’s you who killed my daddy.

182
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
It’s you who framed Xu Feng.

183
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,060
It’s her.

184
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,060
It’s her who has been framing you.

185
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
Frame?

186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,520
Is it her or you

187
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,440
who hurt me?

188
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,480
My Lord,

189
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,140
this woman is so vicious.

190
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,440
She killed you.

191
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,240
And she is angry with me
because I brought you back to life.

192
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,480
She’s determined to kill me.

193
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,640
It’s Run Yu who asks you

194
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,900
to sneak into Demon Realm again and again. Right?

195
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,860
Don't think that I’m as gullible as I was before

196
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,380
so that I will be fooled by you again.

197
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,920
Today,

198
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
if you hurt Sui He,

199
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,780
I will kill you.

200
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,720
My Lord has offered you a chance.

201
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,980
Get out of here. Right now.

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,840
How to repay parents' love.

203
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,160
Even you betray me, too.

204
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
No, please.

205
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,820
No, please.

206
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,180
No, please.

207
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,000
I have only one phoenix hairpin.

208
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,260
I gave it to you.

209
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,800
Can't you still understand my affection?

210
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,220
Put on this phoenix hairpin.

211
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,540
Let it help me protect you from dangers.

212
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,620
No, please.

213
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,140
No, please.

214
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,200
Mi,

215
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,560
hold on a little bit more.

216
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,940
I’ll take you back.

217
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,340
They really work in collusion.

218
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,500
My Lord, are you really
going to let them go like this?

219
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,020
Why are you here?

220
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,820
I consumed much magic power
in order to bring you back to life.

221
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
I heard that the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying
can increase magic power.

222
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,700
So I’m here to take it.

223
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,460
I didn’t expect that Jin Mi was here, too.

224
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,320
And she was going to kill me.

225
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
If you wanted the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying,

226
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,260
you could have told me.

227
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,100
Why did you come here to take it yourself?

228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I just don't want you to worry about me.

229
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,960
You may go first.

230
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,420
Are you still obsessed with her

231
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,120
and missing her?

232
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,520
Won’t you sop

233
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,340
until you are killed in collusion

234
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,740
by them two?

235
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
Xu Feng does believe me.

236
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,440
He does.

237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,680
Little one.

238
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,420
Little one.

239
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,020
Little one.

240
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
Little one.

241
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,120
Mr. Hu.

242
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
Come here.

243
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,640
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

244
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
How is Lord Puchi?

245
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,040
Don’t worry.

246
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,240
His Majesty is sending the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying

247
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,540
into his body.

248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,820
He will wake up soon.

249
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,660
Don’t worry. Don’t worry.

250
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,880
That's good.

251
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,540
Little one.

252
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,460
What's wrong with your eyes?

253
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,380
My eyes?

254
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
What's wrong with my eyes?

255
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,160
I’m asking you.

256
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,140
What?

257
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,180
Are you going to hide this from me?

258
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,100
That stinks.

259
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,980
I asked you to take the red Internal Dan.

260
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,940
But you took the green one.

261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,400
Did I take the green one?

262
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,160
Don’t you know this?

263
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,740
Little one,

264
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
can’t you

265
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,800
distinguish colors?

266
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,800
I see.

267
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,380
Why are you so silly?

268
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,480
For that phoenix,

269
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,620
you even gave up your ability to distinguish colors.

270
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,860
Little one,

271
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,060
you are the daughter of the Floral Immortal.

272
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,000
Alright. Alright.

273
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Don’t tell Chief Peony about this.

274
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,140
You know her.

275
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,380
If she knows this,

276
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,960
she will nag at me for a hundred years.

277
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,820
Mr. Hu, what happened?

278
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,220
Don't scare me.

279
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,680
Are you crying?

280
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,700
No, I’m not crying.

281
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,740
Aren’t you crying?

282
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,380
I haven’t seen you crying
in the previous thousands of years.

283
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,580
My tears are carrot-colored.

284
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,620
Look.

285
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,480
Unfortunately, you can't distinguish colors now.

286
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,100
Don't cry, Mr. Hu.

287
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,980
Carrot color

288
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,380
is quite unusual.

289
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,080
But it’s no pity not to see it.

290
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,840
Right?

291
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Although I can only see black and white,

292
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,640
I think

293
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
the world of black and white

294
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,380
is not bad.

295
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,320
I’m not afraid of the sunlight.

296
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,120
What’s more, I got a blessing in disguise.

297
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,560
Well, what you said does make sense.

298
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,680
Fortunately, you don’t have
the ability to distinguish colors.

299
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,840
Otherwise, you may

300
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,340
have died in that Cave of Jiu Ying.

301
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,440
In these years, many people with strong power

302
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,420
have died for the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying.

303
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,400
According to the stories

304
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,640
and what is mentioned in books,

305
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,420
the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying is red.

306
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,680
This is where Jiu Ying is sinister.

307
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,480
It plays diversion trick

308
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,060
so that

309
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,320
many immortals and demons
have become the its sacrificial offerings.

310
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
Where am I?

311
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,640
Why am I here?

312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
Has he run away again?

313
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,020
I thought it would take much effort to catch you.

314
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,340
I didn’t expect you to be so weak.

315
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,200
But with your remaining magic power,

316
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,080
you can make one more
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow. Right?

317
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,960
Don’t even think about this.

318
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,520
Sorry, Liuying.

319
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,880
I am afraid I can’t keep our appointment
on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.

320
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,200
Commit suicide? It’s not easy!

321
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,620
I will let you

322
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,200
make one more Spirit-Vanishing Arrow willingly.

323
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,120
Lord Puchi, you are awake now.

324
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,280
You're awake finally.

325
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,360
Mi,

326
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
I heard that you had risked your life

327
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,880
to take the Internal Dan of Jiu Ying for me.

328
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,600
I’m very moved.

329
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,040
Beauty, I knew there is a place for me in your heart.

330
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
You are welcome.

331
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,940
It’s good that you are OK now.

332
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,380
Yan You,

333
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,580
which jerk did this to you?

334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,700
Fox Fairy,

335
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,680
why are you here, too?

336
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,880
Mi.

337
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,180
I let Lian Qiao ask Fox Fairy to come over

338
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,960
as a witness.

339
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,240
This time my injury

340
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
was caused by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.

341
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,680
On that day, I went to Demon Realm with Jin Mi

342
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
to see that proud phoenix.

343
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,000
But she disappeared suddenly.

344
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,240
I met Sui He when I was looking for Jin Mi.

345
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,100
Why are you following me?

346
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,740
I heard you said you were

347
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,520
the Demon Lord’s life saver.

348
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,600
I thought I was very shameless.

349
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,620
But when compared with you,

350
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,240
my shamelessness is nothing.

351
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,960
We both

352
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,900
know that it’s Jin Mi who saved Demon Lord.

353
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,080
You falsely claim the contribution as your own.

354
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,720
Aren’t you afraid that Xu Feng will blame you

355
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,920
when he knows the truth one day?

356
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,720
How do you know that
it is Jin Mi who saved Xu Feng?

357
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,840
I went to the Snake Mountain with Jin Mi.

358
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,340
I have seen how

359
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,900
she risked her life

360
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,360
to get the Light of Xuanqiong,
the guiding medicine of Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir.

361
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,680
This time,

362
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,320
I will not let you ruin my happiness

363
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,580
like I did in the Human Realm.

364
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,460
You haven’t changed at all in these years.

365
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,900
You are still a shrew.

366
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,740
You are only good at bluffing.

367
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,420
Today, I will let you shut up forever.

368
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,660
How can you use Glazed Pure Fire?

369
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,240
Were Water Immortal and Wind Immortal

370
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,060
killed by you?

371
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,260
You are not that stupid.

372
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,920
Yan You,

373
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,200
nowadays you are no match for me.

374
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Today, you came on your own.

375
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,780
I will get even with you

376
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,800
for what you did to me in Human Realm.

377
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,020
I never expected

378
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
that I have suffered a series of setback by you

379
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,440
Sui He,

380
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,740
I used to love you with all my heart.

381
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,500
I could do anything for you.

382
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,260
But now

383
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,880
you are going to kill me.

384
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,580
Even so,

385
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,480
I still can't forget you.

386
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,960
I hate myself.

387
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,540
I hate that I can’t forget your charms.

388
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,720
and your every twinkle and smile.

389
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
I laugh at myself for being too shallow.

390
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,900
I hate myself for being humble.

391
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,740
But I still can't forget you.

392
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,840
You turn a blind eye to me,

393
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,080
and want to hurt me

394
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,400
and kill me

395
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,460
But I still...

396
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,500
I still love you.

397
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,800
Leave it.

398
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
If I’m killed by you,

399
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,400
I will die without anything to regret
and with my dream fulfilled.

400
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,340
I only hope that

401
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,920
one day you will remember that

402
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,080
a snake named Yan You loved you so much.

403
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,120
For the sake of my love for you,

404
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,600
could you fulfil my last small wish?

405
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,760
Go ahead.

406
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,940
Step forward a little bit.

407
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
I’m running out of strength.

408
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,020
Damn it.

409
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,460
You used Evil Ashes, playing the same trick of Run Yu.

410
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,440
Having been hurt by my Glazed Pure Fire,

411
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,400
you won’t be alive for long

412
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,220
even if you can run away,

413
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,200
Who should I turn to?

414
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,360
Lord Puchi.

415
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,840
Lord Puchi.

416
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,060
Lord Puchi.

417
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,980
Fortunately, I’m smart enough.

418
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,680
Otherwise, it’s unlikely for me to run off

419
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,980
after being hurt by Sui He’s Glazed Pure Fire.

420
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,240
Fortunately, Jin Mi made the summoning spell.

421
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,620
Otherwise, I would have been caught and killed

422
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,800
by Sui He.

423
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,000
Wait.

424
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,740
What do you mean by

425
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,800
saying you can’t forget Sui He?

426
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,940
I’m ashamed of this.

427
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,420
When I started to become a fairy,

428
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,100
I was a pure and cute snake.

429
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,340
Your Majesty, I’m Sui He, from Bird Family.

430
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,460
This is Yi amber.

431
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,360
It’s made from the eyeballs of colorful-feathered birds.

432
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,780
It not only has a unique radiance

433
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,980
but also means eternal love.

434
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,100
I take this occasion to present to you, Your Majesty.

435
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,300
Your name is Sui He. Right?

436
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,720
You are so considerate.

437
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,800
According to the rules of seniority,

438
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,900
you should call Tu Yao auntie.

439
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,720
Really?

440
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,380
I don’t remember that I have such a relative.

441
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,440
I’m going to take a seat first.

442
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,740
Miss Immortal,

443
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,920
I’m Yan You.

444
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,140
Your smile

445
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
is really unforgettable.

446
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,940
What a nuisance!

447
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,220
Yan You,

448
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
why are you so smart?

449
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,700
This is the flower I picked in the Human Realm.

450
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,640
Here you are.

451
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,540
It’s so beautiful.

452
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,960
There have been no flowers
in Heavenly Realm for thousands of years.

453
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,840
Did you pick it specially for me?

454
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,660
Well...

455
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,400
The flower and me...

456
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,600
Which one is more beautiful?

457
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Your eyes are brighter

458
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,200
than a thousand luminous pearls put together.

459
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,240
Yan You,

460
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,100
would you take a walk with me

461
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,520
in this garden tomorrow?

462
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,780
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

463
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,580
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

464
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,260
<i>The memory haunts me</i>

465
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,300
<i>making me grieved.</i>

466
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,180
<i>I only wish I would never regret in the rest of my life.</i>

467
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,420
<i>Fly away along with the flower aroma.</i>

468
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,000
How dare you!

469
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,900
How dare you do such a licentious thing
in Heavenly Realm!

470
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,360
Your Majesty. Sui He.

471
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,440
This matter is not the way it seems.

472
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,540
There must be some misunderstandings.

473
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,100
Take them away.

474
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,940
Go.

475
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,180
Your Majesty.

476
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,060
Sui He.

477
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,380
Believe me.

478
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,020
I can definitely explain it clearly.

479
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,080
Go.

480
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,620
Snake Fairy Yan You and Fairy Qi Yao

481
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,580
are licentious and shameless.

482
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,420
Yan You, now you are devoid of your fairy identity.

483
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,240
Qi Yao, you are demoted to be a human being.

484
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,360
And you are not allow to
be promoted to be a fairy forever.

485
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,620
Your Majesty,

486
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,240
there are some misunderstandings.

487
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,540
Let me explain.

488
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,860
Explain?

489
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,460
It’s a guilt deliberately imposed on us.

490
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,700
How can you explain this clearly?

491
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,940
Just because Fairy Qi Yao and
Heavenly Emperor made eyes at each other,

492
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,680
Heavenly Empress takes her as the pain in the neck.

493
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,940
Sui He perceived Heavenly Empress’s thoughts.

494
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
So she played this trick

495
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,660
to make Fairy Qi Yao get out of the way

496
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,720
in order to please Heavenly Empress.

497
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,780
Because of this, she

498
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,700
gradually becomes the leader of the Bird Family.

499
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,000
But originally

500
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,620
I intended to fulfill her wish.

501
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,720
So I didn’t mention this thing to anyone.

502
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,260
Since then,

503
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,000
I have never dared to fall in love with anyone again.

504
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,060
I am afraid that one day

505
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,100
my heart will be trampled on the ground again.

506
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,880
Everyone thinks Yan You is a playboy.

507
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,260
But nobody knows that

508
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,980
it’s because you were hurt by your loved one.

509
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,780
Who didn’t do some stupid things

510
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,740
when he or she was young?

511
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,480
We have to experience a lot

512
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,060
so as to become mature.

513
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,740
But it’s OK. I am not that stupid now.

514
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,640
By the way,

515
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,360
when I went to the Cave of Jiu Ying,

516
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,700
Sui He also used Glazed Pure Fire
when fighting with me.

517
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,380
I think she went there

518
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,980
in order to take the Internal Dan

519
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,720
and make you devoid of the chance to wake up.

520
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,960
Why does Sui He have such a strong magic power?

521
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,320
And why can she use Glazed Pure Fire?

522
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,700
Is it Sui He

523
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,320
who killed Luo Lin and Lin Xiu?

524
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,020
That's right.

525
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,260
It’s her.

526
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,140
She admitted it to me in person.

527
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,040
It’s really her.

528
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,020
Then tell Xu Feng immediately.

529
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,080
Kill this vicious woman as soon as possible.

530
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,020
I told him.

531
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,420
But he didn’t believe me.

532
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,060
I used to lie to him and hurt him.

533
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,760
How is it possible that he would trust me again?

534
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,820
Mi,

535
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,420
if you don’t clear the misunderstandings,

536
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,800
then phoenix

537
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,040
is really going to get married with Sui He.

538
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,420
By that time,

539
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,480
if that vicious woman becomes Demon Empress,

540
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,760
there will be no peace in the six realms any longer.

541
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,860
He’s right.

542
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,260
Jin Mi,

543
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,680
there are some misunderstandings
between you and Xu Feng.

544
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,020
You should clear them early.
