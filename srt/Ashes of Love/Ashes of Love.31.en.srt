00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 31"

3
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,420
Cheers!

4
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,560
Jin Mi.

5
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,360
Qiang Huo, cheers. Bottoms up.

6
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,380
We shouldn’t act wantonly in the Palace of King Yi.

7
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,380
No way.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,900
Today is the day

9
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
when Auntie found and brought us back
to Saint Doctors’ Family,

10
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,900
and our birthday as well.

11
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,600
We drank until we got drunk on this day before.

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
Why do we break this rule this year?

13
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,470
Refill it.

14
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:45,670
Come on.

15
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,010
Cheers. Drink it.

16
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,520
I have prepared

17
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,480
a gift for you this year.

18
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,600
Wait a minute.

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,500
Didn’t we promise that we won’t
send gifts to each other on our birthday?

20
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,180
This year is special.

21
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,180
I want to send a gift to you.

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Do you like it?

23
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,100
I’m afraid I don’t any chance to do it again.

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,100
It’s lovely.

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
I think

26
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,320
it resembles you somehow.

27
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,500
It’s so cute.

28
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,580
Jin Mi.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,180
You’re kind to me.

30
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,200
It’s a pity that I can’t marry anyone,

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
so I can

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,580
only love you.

33
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,900
Come on. Let’s go on drinking.

34
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,060
Cheers.

35
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,520
Why is this place so familiar?

36
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,180
I seem to have been here before.

37
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
Frost flower.

38
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,780
I didn’t expect we would meet again.

39
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,400
Unexpectedly, you appear in my dream again.

40
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,440
This isn’t a dream.

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,900
Jin Mi, only you can help me out.

42
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,900
I want to tell one person

43
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,920
I love him.

44
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,060
Love.

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
What is love?

46
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,180
Love means you want to stay with someone

47
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,940
anytime, anyway.

48
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,480
When he smiles, you’re happy.

49
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900
When he cries, you’re sad.

50
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,520
Even if you are imprisoned,

51
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,680
you’ll be desperate to break the bonds

52
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
to come to him.

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,140
I seem to

54
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,680
have such feelings for His Majesty.

55
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,560
Then you love him.

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,960
I,

57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,020
love him?

58
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,180
Jin Mi. Jin Mi.

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,160
Jin Mi, wake up.

60
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,360
Qiang Huo.

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,640
Let’s call it a day.

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,640
You’re drunk already.

63
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,960
I’ll cook something to sober you up.

64
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,960
What if King Yi summons you

65
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,560
and sees

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
your drunken face?

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,980
I’m not drunk.

68
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,200
I’m not drunk at all.

69
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,000
Moreover, King Yi won’t summon me,

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,640
as it is so late.

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,280
Impossible.

72
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,900
Well, let’s go on.

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,400
No.

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,800
Saint Girl.

75
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,300
His Majesty summons you.

76
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,330
It’s so late.

77
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,750
Why does His Majesty summon me?

78
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
You’ll know after getting there.

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,070
A play begins.

80
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,530
The viewer should take a seat at once.

81
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,840
I’m King Yi of Huaiwu.

82
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,620
One day I was free, so I went hunting in the mountain.

83
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,440
I hunted 200 hidden soldiers of Liangguo.

84
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,040
I’m Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family.

85
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,620
One day I was free,
so I gathered herbs in the mountain.

86
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,820
I met the king of Huaiwu.

87
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,980
Wonderful.

88
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,240
How bold you are!

89
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,360
Who sent you to take advantage of me,

90
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,220
strip me of my clothes,

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,500
and touch me here and there?

92
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,840
Was he Duck Nanping?

93
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,340
You’re wrong.

94
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,140
You were both deaf and mute

95
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,220
and could hear nothing back then.

96
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,180
How could you speak?

97
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,500
That’s not true.

98
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,260
King Yi thought so.

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,620
You bandit,

100
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,700
I was so kind to save you,

101
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,180
change your clothes and heal you.

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,940
What did you repay me?

103
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,140
You’re just like

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,220
a furious crow.

105
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,640
Then I’ll call you

106
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,780
Crow.

107
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,440
Why do you cover your face with a veil?

108
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,640
Your Majesty, I’m ugly.

109
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,900
That’s all right. I’m blind.

110
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
It seems that

111
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,440
Your Majesty and I are really

112
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
a match made in heaven.

113
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,640
Little tortoise.

114
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,920
Do you think it looks like you?

115
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes.

116
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,420
You didn’t send the dragon scale to me,

117
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,420
but I send you a little tortoise instead.

118
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,860
So you must send me something else.

119
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,260
What do you want, Your Majesty?

120
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,260
Think about it.

121
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,780
Think about it?

122
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,000
I pretended to be deaf and dumb before you,

123
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,000
so it’s okay to be blind.

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,500
Are you sure?

125
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
Don’t be scared, Your Majesty.

126
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,080
You drank?

127
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,940
Just a little bit.

128
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,600
Are you drunk?

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,420
Was I so ugly just now?

130
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,020
Were you scared?

131
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,800
You were so fast that I couldn’t see it clearly.

132
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,740
Aren’t you afraid of death?

133
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,620
I’m afraid to risk my neck,

134
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,480
but I like you more than my life.

135
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,840
What did you say?

136
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,380
I like you.

137
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,740
Can you repeat it?

138
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,660
Don’t you pretend to be blind?

139
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,120
Now you pretend to be deaf?

140
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
I want to know

141
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,400
if you’re drunk

142
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,580
or I’m dreaming.

143
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,460
Does it hurt?

144
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,740
It seems that I’m not dreaming.

145
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,500
You’re mad with drink.

146
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,700
I’m not drunk.

147
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,340
I just want you to keep my words in mind.

148
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,300
Listen up.

149
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,940
I like you.

150
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,200
I like you.

151
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,780
I like you.

152
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,600
Marry me.

153
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,200
Your Majesty.

154
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,140
An urgent report came from the front line.

155
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,660
Well,

156
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,920
I’ve got to go.

157
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,020
"Yunmeng Pond "

158
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,200
You think

159
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,860
Lord Dongting was mad at you

160
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,860
and refused to meet you

161
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,160
because you left her?

162
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,340
Although I don’t remember it,

163
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
I left with Heavenly Empress

164
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,640
without any signs that night.

165
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,640
It must have been

166
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,020
a heavy blow to her.

167
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,320
All mothers in the world

168
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,340
hope their children are happy.

169
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,340
Lord Dongting knows

170
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,820
your life of the day most clearly.

171
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,460
I think she can understand your choice.

172
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Foster mother is stubborn.

173
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
Please forgive her.

174
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,860
That’s okay.

175
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,640
I can

176
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,420
speak to her here.

177
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,880
I was mean to you yesterday.

178
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,680
I’m so sorry, mom.

179
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,580
After I left, I recalled some past events

180
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,300
and knew that

181
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,200
I blamed you wrongly.

182
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,540
It turns out that you didn’t abandon me.

183
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,640
Instead, I abandoned you.

184
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,400
I was young and ignorant

185
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,660
and must have broken your heart back then.

186
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
I’m ashamed of my behavior.

187
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,900
Now we finally meet again after a long separation.

188
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Seeing that you’re healthy

189
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,020
and have

190
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,220
two excellent adopted sons

191
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,780
to serve you for me,

192
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,760
I’m so happy

193
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,880
yet guilty.

194
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,060
I’m not asking you to forgive me.

195
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,540
But I hope there is still a long time ahead.

196
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,380
I believe

197
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,160
we will meet

198
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
and be together happily someday.

199
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,660
Li.

200
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,660
Li.

201
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,140
Li.

202
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,340
Li.

203
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,840
Li.

204
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,640
Li.

205
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,940
Li.

206
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,240
I wasn’t mad at you.

207
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,440
I’ve long been indifferent to personal life and death.

208
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,160
The reason why I’m still alive is that

209
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
I want to avenge the death of my family members.

210
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,680
Please forgive my cruelty.

211
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,340
You suffered a lot in your childhood

212
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,140
because of me.

213
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,580
Since you have the chance to live freely,

214
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,660
how I can drag you down to the hell?

215
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,460
I wish you peace

216
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,900
and happiness.

217
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,860
I didn’t see my mom today,

218
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,640
but I have two brothers instead.

219
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,160
What a surprise!

220
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,780
There is still a long time ahead.

221
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,960
Faith can move mountains.

222
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,960
I hope

223
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,960
you can pay more attention to mom.

224
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,320
Rest assured, Your Highness.

225
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,380
I will do what I can to help you with this.

226
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,060
Adopted Mother is not stubborn,

227
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,520
but I can’t explain it in detail now.

228
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,380
Your Highness, be patient.

229
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,260
Thank you

230
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,320
for serving mom for me

231
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,840
all these years.

232
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,280
You can call me brother.

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,800
Are you really my brother?

234
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,150
"Beiyuan Villa"

235
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,840
Immortal Run Yu.

236
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,260
Jin Mi,

237
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,280
I’m sorry for coming without invitation.

238
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,480
It doesn’t matter.

239
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,420
I plan to invite you here some days later.

240
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,840
I promised to enjoy epiphyllum

241
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,000
with you,

242
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,440
but I fell asleep that night.

243
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,760
I’m sorry, Immortal Run Yu.

244
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,700
Tonight we cause a sensation.

245
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,340
I must remove

246
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,760
all your memories about tonight.

247
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,400
It doesn’t matter.
We can do it some other day.

248
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,420
Immortal Run Yu,

249
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,060
when I woke up,

250
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
I found this epiphyllum beside me.

251
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,560
Was it planted by you?

252
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes.

253
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,520
I thought you wanted to
cure illnesses and save patients with it.

254
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,520
You’re really an immortal.

255
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,360
I thought so back then,

256
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,900
but that patient had recovered,

257
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,900
so I didn’t need it.

258
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,980
Today, let me make tea

259
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,560
with the dried epiphyllum to entertain you.

260
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,440
Immortal Run Yu.

261
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,420
Fragrant and sweet.

262
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Good tea.

263
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,160
You told me

264
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,540
a fairy promised to enjoy epiphyllum

265
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,860
with you.

266
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,720
Did she keep her promise?

267
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,100
She is experiencing hardships in the mortal world.

268
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
She may live a tough life,

269
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,400
but mortals are not long-lived,

270
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,080
so she may go back to the Heaven Realm soon.

271
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,860
The fairy you bear in mind constantly

272
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,240
must be a stunning fairy.

273
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,900
She’s as kind-hearted

274
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,600
as you.

275
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,180
Your tail is very unique.

276
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,260
I was ugly in my childhood.

277
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,230
Over thousands of years,

278
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,360
she was the first one who saw my real body

279
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,380
but never disliked and avoided me

280
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,660
and even treated me equally without discrimination

281
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,800
After that, whenever I felt confused and helpless,

282
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,480
I was always enlightened by her,

283
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
so I’m very grateful to her.

284
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,420
He’s ugly?

285
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,780
Immortals are so modest.

286
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,780
I told Crow I was ugly.

287
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,440
According to the standard of immortals,

288
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,260
it is actually true.

289
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,200
That fairy that Immortal Run Yu likes

290
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,540
must be very beautiful.

291
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,740
Jin Mi,

292
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,580
in fact, I’m here

293
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,580
to ask you something.

294
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,820
Burn?
Is it serious?

295
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,180
Which part is burnt?
How old is the patient?

296
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,180
How long has the patient been burnt?

297
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,760
She’s an elder who
has a very close relationship with me.

298
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,100
Thousands of years ago,

299
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,940
her face was burnt by roaring flame.

300
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,620
She’s 19,800 years old,

301
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,760
so she’s still young.

302
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,280
19,800 years old?

303
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,320
Since I became Saint Girl,

304
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,800
I have never treated such an old patient.

305
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Immortals can also be ill and burnt?

306
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,420
Are there doctors in the Heaven Realm?

307
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,780
Immortals can also be burnt and ill.

308
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,060
I really want to do something for this elder,

309
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,980
but it’s inconvenient to ask Immortal Qihuang

310
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,680
to treat her for some reasons,

311
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,160
so I’m a little hopeful

312
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,160
about asking you to help me today.

313
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,680
It seems that immortal is very important

314
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,440
to Immortal Run Yu.

315
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,420
I must help him.

316
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,640
Immortal Run Yu,

317
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,040
just a moment, please.

318
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,420
This is Red Jade Regeneration Tissue Cream,

319
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,540
and this is Draconis Sanguis
Tissue Regenereation Cream.

320
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,700
Apply them three times a day.

321
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,140
They can remove stasis, stop pain and bleeding

322
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,960
and promote tissue regeneration,

323
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,940
but I don’t know

324
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,240
her specific symptoms,

325
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
and I only have these two suitable ointments,

326
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,240
so you can take away both of them to have a try.

327
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,360
I’m a genius.

328
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,920
After I became a doctor, my first patient is a king,

329
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,620
and the second one is an immortal.

330
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
An immortal!

331
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
It is unbelievable!

332
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,800
Thank you.

333
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,640
You’re welcome.

334
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,260
If they have no effect on her, come to see me,

335
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,460
and I’ll make other ointments for you.

336
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,020
If I have a chance,

337
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
I’ll lead you to meet that elder.

338
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,760
She’ll definitely be very happy

339
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,480
to meet you.

340
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,780
OK. OK.

341
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,180
It’s dawn soon.

342
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,680
I should leave.

343
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,740
See you.

344
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,920
"Dongting Lake"

345
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,380
Your Highness,

346
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,800
Night Immortal and others go down from here.

347
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,100
So much magic power here.

348
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,020
We seem to find their den.

349
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,200
Let’s go back to the Heaven Realm

350
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,200
to call soldiers together first,

351
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,860
and then kill all of them.

352
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,020
Yes.

353
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,660
It’s you,

354
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,360
Your Majesty.

355
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,520
It’s you again.

356
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,760
Why are you in Water Immortal’s territory?

357
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,180
You really hatch a sinister plot.

358
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,620
Here isn’t your Zifangyun Palace.

359
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,480
You blame Water Immortal and me
for hatching a sinister plot

360
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,280
directly after you came here.

361
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,820
Isn’t the Heaven Realm a legal society?

362
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,140
You should stop disgracing Heavenly Emperor.

363
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,140
How dare you!

364
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,540
I’m Heavenly Empress!

365
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,640
I know

366
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,720
you harbor the important criminal of the Heaven Realm.

367
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,720
Your silver tongue

368
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,120
can’t save you.

369
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,780
We’re really old enemies.

370
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,060
It turns out Heavenly Empress is your master,

371
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,480
so she is the backstage manipulator

372
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,300
who wants to murder Jin Mi.

373
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,340
Kill him

374
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,100
to make up for your error.

375
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,360
OK.

376
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,260
You finally come.

377
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,540
It’s you.

378
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,420
Yes.

379
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,820
Since the dragonfish of Lake Taihu didn’t go extinct,

380
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,820
I had doubts before.

381
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,420
You’re so guileful.

382
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,040
Today I’ll definitely kill you.

383
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,840
Tai Wei is merciless

384
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,280
and ruins my life,

385
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,800
and you grabbed my son
and killed all my family members.

386
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,480
For 1,000 years,
I have had countless sleepless nights

387
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,480
and vowed to overturn your tyranny.

388
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Today Heavenly Emperor isn’t here.

389
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,280
If I kill you,

390
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,940
I can console my innocent family members.

391
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,100
Sun Destroying Ice Needle?

392
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,360
You’re the backstage manipulator
who wanted to murder my son.

393
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,000
It looks good

394
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
and also smells good.

395
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,780
I believe Lord Dongting

396
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,660
will be definitely touched by your filial piety.

397
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,340
In fact, I have another plan.

398
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,480
I’m going to take Jin Mi to meet my mom

399
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,060
after she finishes experiencing hardships.

400
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,300
With these two boxes of
tissue regeneration ointments,

401
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,300
she’ll leave a good impression on my mom.

402
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,520
You’re considerate, Your Highness.

403
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,960
Given Fairy Jin Mi’s characters,

404
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,500
she’ll definitely be favored by Lord Dongting.

405
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,760
We’re close to Dongting Lake.

406
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,900
Your Highness, keep them well

407
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,520
to prevent from sprinkling out.

408
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,240
Brother. Brother.

409
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,000
Brother. Sister.

410
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,980
Li.

411
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,980
Loach,

412
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,500
why are you here?

413
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,840
You ran away from home again?

414
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,060
Something, something bad happens.

415
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,060
Someone, someone wants to kill Mom.

416
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,300
Who?

417
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,560
Golden, golden…

418
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,400
Heavenly Empress.

419
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,740
Li.

420
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,960
Run Yu.

421
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,300
Li.

422
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,660
You fool.

423
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,380
-You want to be killed?
-Mom.

424
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,700
You’re seeking your doom.

425
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,300
Run Yu,

426
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,120
you also want to fight against me?

427
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,420
Mother,

428
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,940
she is my biological mother.

429
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,680
For the sake of Father and me,

430
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,140
I beg you to let her go.

431
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,380
Run Yu,

432
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,220
you’re even not

433
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,040
as determined as you were in your childhood.

434
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,580
Did you forget such a decision was made by you?

435
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,420
Do you come to send me to the Heaven?

436
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,780
Are you eager to go to the Heaven?

437
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,340
It’s so miserable to live in the lake.

438
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,520
As long as I can leave the lake,

439
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
I’m willing to go anyplace.

440
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,080
As long as you listen to me and then follow me,

441
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,680
you won’t suffer.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,180
How about my mom?

443
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,300
Your mom will also feel relieved.

444
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,400
Take this Floating Dream Pill.

445
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,600
You’ll forget everything,

446
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,360
and then you can get rid of suffering,

447
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,860
so will your mom.

448
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,000
Because of me,

449
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Mom has such a hard life.

450
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,960
Mom, I know you love me,

451
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,360
but your love is too painful.

452
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,680
I really can’t stand it.

453
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,740
Mom,

454
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,220
I’ll leave soon.

455
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,020
Without me,

456
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,120
you’ll be definitely happy.

457
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,460
Mom, no!

458
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,340
No!

459
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,500
I was wrong.

460
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,120
Mom, I was wrong.

461
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,720
Mom,

462
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,220
I’m back.

463
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,600
I won’t leave.

464
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,480
I won’t leave you again.

465
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,460
Run Yu,

466
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,280
is it your final decision?

467
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,740
As the son of Heavenly Emperor,

468
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,960
you want to treat her as your mom?

469
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,920
Li.

470
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,960
Mother,

471
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,580
I know

472
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,840
you always worry

473
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,180
I’ll become Xu Feng’s competitor,

474
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,180
but, in fact, I never have such an idea.

475
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,180
I have left my mom for many years.

476
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,340
Now I only want to live with her quietly.

477
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,160
For it, I can give up everything.

478
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,640
I beg you to let her go.

479
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,040
If you want to save her,

480
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,740
I’ll no longer treat you as my son.

481
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,360
Mother,

482
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,900
I beg you.

483
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,600
I beg you to let her go.

484
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,360
I beg you.

485
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,420
I beg you.

486
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,920
Now that you still stick to saving her,

487
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,580
I’ll kill both of you!

488
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,080
I beg you, Mother.

489
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,840
I beg you.

490
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,920
Mom.

491
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,700
Mom.

492
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,680
Mom.

493
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,760
Mom.

494
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,000
Mom.

495
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Li,

496
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,380
I’m content

497
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,760
to see you before my death.

498
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,680
In my life,

499
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,560
my biggest regret

500
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
is to meet Heavenly Emperor,

501
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,800
but I

502
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,240
never regret

503
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,300
giving birth to you.

504
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,760
I never hate you.

505
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,020
I have remembered everything.

506
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,940
You, you didn’t abandon me.

507
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,460
I was cheated by Heavenly Empress

508
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,260
and took her Floating Dream Pill, so I…

509
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,440
I owe you so much this life.

510
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,820
These years,

511
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,880
I’m so lonely.

512
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,620
I’m tired.

513
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,880
In the future,

514
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,660
I can’t accompany you any more.

515
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,640
I’m tired.

516
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,940
Hug me like this

517
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,560
for a while.

518
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,320
No.

519
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,260
No, Mom. Mom.

520
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,040
Mom, don’t sleep.

521
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Don’t sleep.

522
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,140
I’ll save you.

523
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,160
I’ll save you.

524
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,240
Mom.

525
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,760
Mom, I can save you.

526
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,580
Your Highness.

527
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,800
She is dead.

528
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,260
Mom.

529
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
Mom.

530
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,420
Mom.

531
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,100
Run Yu,

532
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,420
it’s your turn.
