00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 53"

3
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,940
I think you must have heard of

4
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,360
this announcement of Heaven Realm.

5
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,960
My nirvana and rebirth

6
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,660
is the will of God,

7
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,160
so I won’t let it down.

8
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,380
I’ll atone for the crime of my parents,

9
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,400
but I’ll never forget how Run Yu

10
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,860
killed my parents and me.

11
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,200
I’ll take my revenge one by one.

12
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,800
What’s your plan?

13
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,300
Now

14
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,100
I’m not

15
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
an immortal

16
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,500
or a human.

17
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,560
I have no place

18
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,220
to shelter myself in the world.

19
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,440
I’m determined to be a demon

20
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,780
and fight against Run Yu.

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,780
I’m willing to lend you a hand.

22
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,020
We need to make a detailed plan now

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
to defeat King of Gu City.

24
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,460
I have planted a special man

25
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,840
to deal with this matter.

26
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,400
We did capture Li Chuan,

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,140
but he died of the poison of crimson grass

28
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,140
in jail just now.

29
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,740
Your Highness.

30
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,720
Li Chuan.

31
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,740
No.

32
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,780
You’re not Li Chuan.

33
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,240
You’re sharp-eyed.

34
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,320
He’s Mo Qi,

35
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,920
the twin brother of Li Chuan.

36
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,480
Whether we can achieve our goal completely

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
depends on a key person.

38
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
Do you know this object?

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,200
Where did you get this seal?

40
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,660
When I experienced hardships
with His Highness in mortal world,

41
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,940
I helped a strange person by accident.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,220
This seal was given by that person.

43
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,800
That man promised that

44
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,460
I could fulfill a wish with this object,

45
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
but I just did him a small favor

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,560
and wanted nothing in return.

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,980
You can bring it back to the Demon Realm.

48
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,680
Maybe you can meet its owner

49
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,900
and return it to him

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,700
or ask him to do you a favor when you need it.

51
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,580
It’s better for you to keep it.

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
Lord Liaoyuan was loyal all his life.

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,880
The good deed you did before

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,100
has helped Xu Feng.

55
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,380
You may rest in peace.

56
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,000
Li Chuan,

57
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
you’re still alive.

58
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,060
I escaped.

59
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,420
Since you can survive,

60
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,560
why do you come back?

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,780
To live is no better than to die.

62
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,220
I don’t understand why you killed me

63
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,580
as I was always obsessed with herbs

64
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,580
and held myself aloof from the world.

65
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,360
Why?

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,700
You’re so stupid.

67
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,100
Xu Feng found out your crimson grass.

68
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,240
If you didn’t die,

69
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,620
he would find me

70
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,380
following up your clue.

71
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,140
Without the poisonous needle of Qiong Qi,

72
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,060
how could I cultivate crimson grass?

73
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
How could you shirk responsibility

74
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
and not care whether I died or lived?

75
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,580
So what?

76
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,660
It was you who killed King of Yan City.

77
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,120
At the mention of this,

78
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,140
I really want to thank you.

79
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,740
Without your crimson grass,

80
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,860
how could I kill the former Demon Lord?

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,200
How dare you

82
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,680
kill Demon Lord to get his post

83
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,780
and frame others!

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,660
Fine, you get it now.

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,580
Don’t you know that the more you know,

86
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,420
the faster you will die?

87
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,900
Now you can’t even survive.

88
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,820
Stop.

89
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,540
Xu Feng.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,580
You really came back to life.

91
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,940
Mo Qi, thank you for helping me.

92
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,540
My pleasure.

93
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,500
You…

94
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,080
You have admitted that
you killed King of Yan City just now.

95
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,900
What else can you say?

96
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,240
Yes,

97
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,140
I did kill King of Yan City with poison.

98
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,360
So what?

99
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,140
Now I’m the Demon Lord.

100
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,540
What can you do to me?

101
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,080
I can do nothing to you,

102
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,540
but there is someone in Demon Realm
who can do something to you.

103
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,800
Great Elder.

104
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,660
In Demon Realm,

105
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,940
the one plotted to murder the Demon Lord

106
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,860
and framed other king.

107
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,980
How should we punish him?

108
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,740
Dismember his body and
soak him in Wangchuan River.

109
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,500
Then

110
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,320
execute it this way.

111
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,620
Great Elder.

112
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,380
Now, as the Great Elder,

113
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,240
I remove you from the post of Demon Lord
on behalf of 12 cities on all sides.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,580
You…

115
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,320
Xu Feng,

116
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,300
I was trapped by you.

117
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,440
King of Qing City,

118
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,740
please take charge of it.

119
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,560
Thank you for helping Demon Realm.

120
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,600
I’ll take charge of here.

121
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,120
He ran away.

122
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,800
It’s okay.

123
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,340
He’s injured and can’t get far.

124
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Moon Immortal.

125
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,020
Moon Immortal.

126
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
He descended to the mortal world, I guess.

127
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,840
Mortal world?

128
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
"Yujiang Palace"

129
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,860
Great Elder.

130
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,140
A few days ago,

131
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,800
some changes took place in Demon Realm.

132
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
I think you must have known about it.

133
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,000
Now

134
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,740
the rebellion has been put down

135
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,580
and the rebel has been defeated and escaped.

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,180
But the post of Demon Lord is vacant.

137
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,340
Today I call you together

138
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,820
to recommend the new Demon Lord.

139
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,440
I want to recommend King of Bian City
as the new Demon Lord.

140
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
What’s your opinion?

141
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,180
-King of Bian City is good.
- Yes.

142
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,900
King of Bian City is qualified for this job.

143
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,540
Great Elder.

144
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,180
King of Yan City passed away and
King of Gu City was defeated and escaped.

145
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,580
Although I’m one of the three kings

146
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,100
and qualified for the post of Demon Lord,

147
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,340
I’m too old.

148
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,780
I'm afraid I'm not equal to the position.

149
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,980
I want to recommend someone for this.

150
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,500
Who do you want to recommend?

151
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,420
Xu Feng,

152
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,760
the former Fire Immortal of Heaven Realm.

153
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
Fire Immortal isn’t a member of our family.

154
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,300
How can he be qualified
for the post of Demon Lord?

155
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,980
Great Elder can grant him the blood.

156
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,480
I think it works.

157
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,960
We attacked Wangchuan River
in the past for several times,

158
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,860
but were defeated by Fire Immortal all the time.

159
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,140
If he becomes the Demon Lord,

160
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,860
he will make our Demon Realm strong for sure.

161
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,220
We may displease Heaven Realm in this way.

162
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,080
Now many changes have
taken place in our Demon Realm.

163
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,100
If Heaven Realm launches an attack on us,

164
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,080
I’m afraid we can’t stand it.

165
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,460
We have God of War here.

166
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,460
We don’t have to fear.

167
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,580
Demon Realm and Heaven Realm
always act in their own way.

168
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,860
How can we offend it?

169
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,960
Fire Immortal Xu Feng

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,760
helped us put down a rebellion
in Demon Realm for many times.

171
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,420
Demon Realm should feel indebted to him.

172
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,140
What’s more, he saved my life.

173
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,600
I’m also indebted to him.

174
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,380
Fire Immortal Xu Feng can
take up the post of Demon Lord.

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Fire Immortal Xu Feng.

176
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
King of Qing City.

177
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,740
Fire Immortal Xu Feng,

178
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,300
are you willing to become
a member of the Demon Family

179
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,080
and take up the post of Demon Lord?

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
Wait a moment.

181
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,580
Wait a moment.

182
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,240
Don’t say yes.

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,860
Or you have no chance to return,

184
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,940
Xu Feng.

185
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,940
I’m willing to join the Demon Family

186
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,660
and spare no effort to serve
the members of Demon Realm all my life.

187
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,460
Grant demon blood.

188
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,740
Xu Feng,

189
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,160
you must think twice.

190
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
You’re the son of Heavenly Emperor

191
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
Do you really want to give up
the blood of Heaven Realm?

192
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,720
Have you thought it over?

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Have you ever seen clearly

194
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,400
what the Heaven Realm is like?

195
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,640
Have you thought about

196
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,380
the reason why Water Immortal
preferred marrying Jin Mi to me than you?

197
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,740
Why can I, a traitor,

198
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,360
ascend the throne successfully

199
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,260
as I started a rebellion?

200
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,340
Why did no one in the
whole Heaven Realm say anything

201
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,020
as your mother jumped off the Linyuan Tower?

202
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,100
It wasn’t because

203
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
I was calculating and dictatorial,

204
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,800
but because they were reactionary

205
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,300
and deserted by their followers.

206
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,000
Xu Feng!

207
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,200
Xu Feng!

208
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,540
From today on,

209
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:34,140
I’m a member of Demon Realm

210
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,920
and have nothing to do
with Heaven Realm anymore.

211
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
Grant Demon Dagger.

212
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,260
Demon Lord, get up.

213
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,660
Xu Feng.

214
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,700
God bless the Demon Realm, my Lord.

215
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,740
God bless the Demon Realm, my Lord.

216
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,180
God bless the Demon Realm, my Lord.

217
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Xu Feng!

218
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,940
Go.

219
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,960
Xu Feng!

220
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,020
Your Majesty.

221
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,700
Is it the news from the Demon Realm?

222
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,560
His Highness Fire Immortal

223
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,500
became the Demon Lord.

224
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,580
I get it.

225
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,020
Such a provocative act of Fire Immortal

226
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,840
is equal to a declaration of war to Heaven Realm.

227
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,820
Now Xu Feng isn’t what he used to be.

228
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,240
What do you mean?

229
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,520
You can leave.

230
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,460
Xu Feng.

231
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,720
Demon Lord.

232
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,820
No.

233
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,080
How could it be possible?

234
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,880
He is forced to do so by you.

235
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,060
It’s all your fault.

236
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,940
It’s all your fault.

237
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,260
Xu Feng is forced to be Demon Realm.

238
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
It’s all your fault.

239
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,660
My poor Xu Feng!

240
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,660
My poor Xu Feng!

241
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,680
Demon Realm finally is back on track.

242
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,700
Lord Liaoyuan must be delighted

243
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,100
to see Xu Feng granted with

244
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,780
the blood of Great Elder.

245
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,540
It’s said that one good turn deserves another.

246
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,640
Lord Liaoyuan did good deeds all his life

247
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,060
and even Great Elder of
our Demon Realm received his help.

248
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,040
However, he was killed by
his colleague in Heaven Realm.

249
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,200
How unfair!

250
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,100
Demon Lord keeps old friendships in mind.

251
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,700
Although he says nothing,

252
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,700
he doesn’t find a new one

253
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,220
to replace Lord Liaoyuan.

254
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,660
He never forgets Lord Liaoyuan

255
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,000
and does so to mourn him.

256
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,240
They start well and end well.

257
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,980
That’s rare.

258
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,100
"Xuanji Palace"
Since Fire Immortal

259
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,140
became the Demon Lord,

260
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,280
he fought battles everywhere

261
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,180
and united tribes of all sizes in Demon Realm.

262
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
He even took over all the troops of King of Gu City.

263
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,820
Now King of Gu City is miserable

264
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,880
and has to hide and escape everywhere.

265
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,420
Fire Immortal dominates Demon Realm.

266
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,600
It’s said that he is the most
powerful Demon Lord throughout history.

267
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,680
And he is highly respected.

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,520
This album of painting painted
by the painter of Demon Realm

269
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,900
is a best-seller.

270
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,300
I exchanged it with one year
of magic power from a demon.

271
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,940
I heard that

272
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,560
because of his extremely handsome face,

273
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,260
various female demons in Demon Realm

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
tried their best to work
as his maids in Yujiang Palace.

275
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,580
He accepted all of them in his palace.

276
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,020
Beauty,

277
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,820
in my opinion,

278
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,660
you shouldn’t be sad for such a playboy,

279
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,940
but should throw yourself in my arms early.

280
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,820
I didn’t expect that

281
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,560
he became the Demon Lord.

282
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,560
It’s all my fault.

283
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,460
He joined the Demon Family because of me.

284
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,740
Don’t blame yourself.

285
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Although Demon Realm
isn’t as gorgeous as Floral Realm

286
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,780
or as dreamlike as Heaven Realm,

287
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,180
it is a place where he can live after all.

288
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,380
Moreover, I’ve told you

289
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,220
he is the king and lives
a lawless and powerful life

290
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,260
in Demon Realm now.

291
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
Don’t worry about him.

292
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,760
Whatever.

293
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,080
It’s fine as long as he is safe.

294
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,500
<i>I will wait for you there</i>

295
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,680
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>

296
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,220
<i>From the love letter,</i>

297
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,180
<i>I find the places where we will fall in love in each life.</i>

298
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,700
<i>I will sing there, playing the moonlight.</i>

299
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,800
What is that?

300
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,400
Nothing.

301
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,580
The painting style of Demon Realm is so weird.

302
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,280
Well,

303
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,080
you like this?

304
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
When are you going to let me out?

305
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,300
You can get out when you recover.

306
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,800
I have recovered.

307
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,560
You can’t even wait to see him?

308
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,960
Have you ever thought that

309
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,420
maybe he doesn’t want to see you?

310
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,360
I know.

311
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,840
I just…

312
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,480
I just want to see him from a distance.

313
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,040
Xu Feng.

314
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,500
Xu Feng.

315
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,680
Xu Feng.

316
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,160
Xu Feng, what’s wrong with you?

317
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,240
Alcohol is pernicious to health.

318
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,160
Xu Feng.

319
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,120
Xu Feng.

320
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,140
I’m fine.

321
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
-Leave me alone.
-Xu Feng.

322
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,360
Xu Feng.

323
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,640
Xu Feng.

324
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,760
Xu Feng.

325
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,260
What’s wrong with these scars?

326
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,000
I was betrayed by Que Ling

327
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,620
and what’s more,

328
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,840
I poured all my magic power into your soul,

329
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,220
so I was injured by Yin Que

330
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,660
and expelled from the Bird Family.

331
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,620
Those scars were left accidentally.

332
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,120
Just the small Bird Family.

333
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,580
I’ll get it back for you.

334
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,320
Really?

335
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,640
Don’t ever think that
our Bird Family will yield to you.

336
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
If you kill me,

337
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,940
you’ll run the risk of
being the enemy of His Majesty.

338
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
You don’t dare.

339
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
Demon Lord.

340
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,520
From today on,

341
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,040
Sui He

342
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,620
is the Leader of the Bird Family.

343
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,120
Yes.

344
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,460
Kneel down.

345
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,380
Your Highness, spare me, please.

346
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,740
I hate betrayal most.

347
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,800
I trusted you so much,

348
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,980
but you colluded with others to frame me.

349
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,300
How dare you beg for mercy.

350
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,980
I was wrong.

351
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
I did a stupid thing.

352
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,180
Spare me, Your Highness.

353
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Now what you say is useless.

354
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,780
Put her in prison.

355
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,060
You’re so kind to this traitor.

356
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,380
Execute her in public in three days

357
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,660
and show the entire Bird Family

358
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,960
the result of a traitor.

359
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,580
Take her away.

360
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,460
Yes.

361
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,320
Your Highness.

362
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Your Highness.

363
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,860
My Lord,

364
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,940
thank you for recapturing
the entire Bird Family for me.

365
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,500
Now

366
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,380
Sui He is having a housecleaning
in Feiluan Palace.

367
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,520
Yin Que was put to death
by Xu Feng in public

368
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,600
and all of his men were put into prison.

369
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,520
The Bird Family now announces officially that

370
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,320
it belongs to Demon Realm.

371
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,300
Your Majesty.

372
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,260
Report,

373
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,960
King of Gu City of Demon
Realm wants to meet you.

374
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,040
King of Gu City.

375
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,800
Yes.

376
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,420
"Qizheng Hall"

377
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,580
Your Majesty.

378
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,680
You come here alone.

379
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,560
How bold you are.

380
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,580
What brings you here?

381
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,460
I’m here to beg you

382
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,020
to help me get back the post of Demon Lord.

383
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,540
You do encounter difficulty,

384
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,540
but how come you have a poor memory?

385
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,360
You planned to attack
Heaven Realm not long ago.

386
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,300
Now

387
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,440
you want Heaven Realm to help you

388
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,460
get back the post of Demon Lord?

389
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,540
That was then and this is now.

390
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,720
I heard that the Bird Family has announced that

391
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,940
it paid allegiance to Demon Realm.

392
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,460
I think the new Demon Lord

393
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,220
must be a headache for you, huh?

394
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,940
It’s none of your business.

395
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
The current Demon Lord

396
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,940
is the former powerful God of War after all.

397
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,340
He’s recruiting followers to enlarge the troops

398
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,860
of Demon Realm these days.

399
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,240
His wild ambition is clearly revealed.

400
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,580
If he declares war to Heaven Realm,

401
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,820
are you sure to defeat him completely?

402
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,860
If you help me get back the post of Demon Lord,

403
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,580
I will be willing to acknowledge allegiance to you

404
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,620
and Demon Realm will also
listen to the orders of Heaven Realm.

405
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,580
As far as I know,

406
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,900
you’re wanted by Demon Realm

407
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,400
like the underdog now.

408
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,080
Even if I intend to get rid of the Demon Lord,

409
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,740
I can plant others.

410
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,520
How can you negotiate terms with me?

411
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,240
What if I find the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

412
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,680
and kill Xu Feng completely for you?

413
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,200
I couldn’t find you anywhere.

414
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,580
It turns out that you hide here.

415
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,940
Why do you hide here and drink alone

416
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,860
instead of doing matchmaking?

417
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,900
I have been disillusioned with the world

418
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,440
and I'm so depressed.

419
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,240
What brings you here?

420
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,140
Now your brother is so powerful.

421
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,380
Why don’t you follow him?

422
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,060
Your second nephew is more powerful

423
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,560
and has become the Demon Lord.

424
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,120
Why don’t you ride on his coattails?

425
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,080
I had long given up on Run Yu,

426
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,840
but I didn’t expect that Xu Feng went too far

427
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,080
and even became the Demon Lord.

428
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,960
He is so disappointing.

429
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,720
These two kids

430
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,540
want to torment me to death.

431
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,300
I'm so depressed.

432
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,700
I just want to die.

433
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,720
There is someone else
who is disappointing too.

434
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,280
Jin Mi is chambered.

435
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,060
Only you can break the ward of Run Yu.

436
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,180
Bad Grape.

437
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,720
She helped Run Yu deal with Xu Feng.

438
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
She deserves to be chambered.

439
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,360
She should even be
punished by Thunder and Fire.

440
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,640
When did she help Run Yu?

441
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,840
If she didn’t help Xu Feng run away,

442
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
Run Yu wouldn’t have her chambered.

443
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,780
I don’t want to listen to it.

444
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,180
I don’t want to listen to it.

445
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,420
I don’t want to listen to it!

446
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,680
Don’t absolve her from her blame.

447
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,820
Fine. Fine.

448
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,900
She deserves it.

449
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,880
Would you please teach her a lesson in person?

450
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,760
Go.

451
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,400
Don’t pull me.

452
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,260
She harmed Xu Feng.

453
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,700
I won’t help her.

454
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,640
Fine.

455
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,380
Give me a Red String.

456
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,860
I’ll tie it to her and let her harm me.

457
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,340
I’m sure that she won’t
bother your second nephew again.

458
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,440
No way!

459
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,320
Go.

460
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,980
Let’s go.

461
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,180
Stop drinking.

462
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,480
You’re so heavy.

463
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,940
Now I have recovered.

464
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,720
Maybe I can break this ward.

465
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,000
Fox Fairy.

466
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,140
Lord Puchi.

467
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,980
What are you doing here?

468
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,360
What are we doing here?

469
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,220
My beauty,

470
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,660
you break my heart.

471
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,280
I’m here to save you.

472
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,460
We should thank Fox Fairy

473
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,680
for breaking an opening for us today.

474
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,840
Fox Fairy,

475
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,860
thank you.

476
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,580
I helped him instead of you.

477
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,940
Since you got out,

478
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,160
I’ll leave.

479
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,840
Wait a moment.

480
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,880
How come the elder you are,
the more bashful you become?

481
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,720
Don’t be bashful.

482
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,780
She and I share everything.

483
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,380
Well,

484
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,820
since you get out

485
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,780
and Fox Fairy is present,

486
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,260
tell us what you want to do.

487
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,920
For example,

488
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,140
elope with me.

489
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:08,980
You…

490
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,680
I,

491
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,300
I want to go to Demon Realm

492
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,020
to meet him.

493
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
You’re not so ungrateful.

494
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,260
I really appreciate that you saved me

495
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,620
from danger and disaster again and again.

496
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,840
Who served grapes here?

497
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,900
Don’t you know that Lord hates this fruit most?

498
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,620
Lord, spare me.

499
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,500
Lord, spare me.

500
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,880
Lord, spare me.

501
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,140
Phoenix,

502
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,660
You really hate me.

503
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,300
Lord, spare me.

504
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,520
Lord, spare me.

505
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,420
Lord, spare me.

506
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,640
He came back to life,

507
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,600
but he is no longer the same Phoenix.

508
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,960
Should I not meet him again?

509
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,420
Give me one more chance.

510
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,700
If you bloom,

511
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,300
I’ll go to meet him again.

512
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,960
If you don’t,

513
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:06,860
I’ll no longer meet him all my life.

514
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,300
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>

515
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,900
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

516
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,820
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

517
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,880
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>
