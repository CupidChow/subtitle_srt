00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 27"

3
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Mu Ci.

4
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,120
Stop!

5
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,672
Since I can’t grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

6
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:42,051
I can kill Princess of Bian City
as another task to His Majesty.

7
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,920
Mu Ci, will you stay with me

8
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,720
only if I am hurt?

9
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
I really went to find you,

10
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
but no one knew your whereabouts.

11
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,320
In the several hundred years when you disappeared,

12
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,040
I had been waiting for you
at the bank of Wangchuan River.

13
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you leaving again?

14
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,880
I am not leaving.

15
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,960
You haven’t recovered.

16
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,843
Don’t always move.

17
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,219
Lie down to have a rest.

18
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,760
"Beiyuan Villa"

19
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:58,640
"Peace reigns over the land"

20
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Your Majesty, it’s late.

21
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,680
You should go to bed.

22
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,620
Don’t put off till tomorrow
what should be done today.

23
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:22,913
I’ll finish the memorials first.

24
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Leave me alone.

25
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
Yes, I am leaving.

26
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and kill Xu Feng.

27
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,160
Foster mother,
is what you want me to do really right?

28
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Whether the arrow falls or not

29
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
depends on my hair.

30
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
Is there any good news?

31
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,840
I am incompetent and lost Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

32
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
You stayed in the human world for so many days,

33
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,640
and you just bring me such a surprise.

34
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,800
Your Majesty, His Highness went down
the Human Realm to experience hardships,

35
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,080
which shocked the six realms.

36
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,400
I’m afraid many people

37
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
will harm the second Prince.

38
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,480
Who?

39
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,880
Besides Demon Realm,
Snake Fairy Yan You also wants to do so.

40
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
I doubt that

41
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
he stole Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

42
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,840
When my birthday feast was disturbed last time,

43
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,320
I already doubted

44
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Yan You must be related to it.

45
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
This time, he made a comeback.

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,560
I am afraid the masters
behind Snake Fairy and Rat Fairy

47
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,440
are the same one.

48
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,360
You go to investigate who it is.

49
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,160
Especially, you need to watch
Water Immortal and Night Immortal carefully.

50
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
Night Immortal

51
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,480
has gone down the Human Realm
to meet Jin Mi secretly

52
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,800
and destroyed Your Majesty’s plan many times.

53
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,440
Did he do anything bad to Xu Feng?

54
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,600
No.

55
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Damned it. Run Yu always goes against me.

56
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,320
He deserves death.

57
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,240
You can’t treat him lightly.

58
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Has Sui He’s memory been opened?

59
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
I have been searching for
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow recently,

60
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,720
so I haven’t opened

61
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,080
Princess Sui He’s memory yet.

62
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,600
To destroy Jin Mi is important,

63
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,600
but you can’t delay opening Sui He’s memory.

64
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
If her memory is opened,

65
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,720
she can help you in the human world.

66
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,560
You two can make a decision
as the occasion requires.

67
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,400
Yes.

68
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
Do not let me doubt your value.

69
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,200
If you can’t find Spirit-Vanishing Arrow back,

70
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,960
I will make another one with your heart blood.

71
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,480
Mu Ci.

72
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,600
You haven’t recovered yet.
Why do you walk around?

73
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,160
After waking up, I found you were gone.

74
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
I thought you had left again,

75
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,200
so I went to look for you.

76
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,520
There is no prey on the mountain,

77
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,760
so I went to pick some fruits.

78
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
Eat some first.

79
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,920
You haven’t recovered yet,

80
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,240
so don’t walk around.

81
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Can you give it back to me now?

82
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,160
You are obedient this time.
I will spare you.

83
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,080
Mu Ci, you haven’t told me

84
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,840
how you were doing these years.

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,120
Where are you going?

86
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,360
I’m going to fetch some water.

87
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,960
You must come back.

88
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
I thought you wouldn’t come back.

89
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
What do you want to eat?
I’m going to cook for you.

90
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,440
Don’t get busy.

91
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,960
You have almost fully recovered.

92
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,040
If there is nothing else,

93
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,360
you should go back to
Demon Realm as soon as possible.

94
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,080
You go back to Demon Realm with me.

95
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,240
I can’t go back to Demon Realm again.

96
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Why?

97
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Stop asking me.

98
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,960
I have changed.

99
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
Please don’t be so obsessed with me, Your Highness.

100
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
You saved me again and again,

101
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
which shows you still care about me.

102
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Then why are you so heartless?

103
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
Because without me,

104
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,400
you can live a better life.

105
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,920
Mu Ci.

106
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Forget me.

107
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,979
"Yunmeng Lake"

108
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,840
On the vast land, ghosts hide in the dark.

109
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,360
Above the dense fog, clouds fly.

110
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
Fog.

111
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
Fog. Fog.

112
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,000
Fog. Fog.

113
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,480
Fog. Fog. Fog.

114
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
Good-for-nothing.

115
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,800
You can’t even do the
simplest water and fog skill well.

116
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
I remember when you were 3,

117
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
you learned tidal bore skill without teacher.

118
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
You could tread and move wave and drive torrent.

119
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
Why do you become worse now?

120
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,520
Do you deserve to be my son?

121
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
Stop crying.

122
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,840
You have made no progress.

123
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,400
How can I leave without worry?

124
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,640
Do you know?

125
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,200
There are wicked and crafty people

126
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
who want to kill you for an award outside.

127
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,160
Stop crying.

128
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,280
Go.

129
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,280
Master.

130
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,880
Yan You, did you make it?

131
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,280
I am incompetent,
so I couldn’t grab Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

132
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,640
Why did you lose?

133
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,120
Master,

134
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,880
in the cycle of heaven,
the son pays his mother’s debt.

135
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
He will be punished.

136
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Why not submit to the will of Heaven

137
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,640
and let him grow and die
without outside interference?

138
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,520
Submit to the will of Heaven?
Grow and die without outside interference?

139
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Is this a joke?

140
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
I can’t wait for so long.

141
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,200
I want him to pay with his life.

142
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,960
General, the lanterns

143
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
can be handled by the
Lantern Chief of Shanqin Bureau.

144
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,640
But you are asked to

145
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
buy paper and bamboo strips in person.

146
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,080
I think His Majesty

147
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,640
doesn’t regard you as an outsider at all.

148
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,560
You don’t understand.

149
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
These are not ordinary lanterns.

150
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,160
They are secret weapons

151
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,120
of His Majesty.

152
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,720
Of course the best moonlight paper

153
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
and toughest bamboo strips must be selected.

154
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,244
Weapon? What weapon?

155
00:14:46,726 --> 00:14:47,780
To deal with Liangguo?

156
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,680
Though the opponent is not Liangguo,

157
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,240
for His Majesty,

158
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,800
it is as hard as a tough battle.

159
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, I see.

160
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,240
Then you are the best person to do it.

161
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,840
It’s late. Let’s go back.

162
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,160
General, general.

163
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,680
Well…

164
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,240
We seem to be here just now.

165
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
I see this tree for the second time.

166
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,600
Well…

167
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,320
General,

168
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,520
did we encounter ghosts?

169
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Nonsense. I’m going to find someone to ask.

170
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,480
You wait for me here.

171
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,280
Excuse me, I’d like to ask the way.

172
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,480
This time,

173
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,320
I will go first.

174
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Life is tough.

175
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,720
Though you treated me so well all my life,

176
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:35,640
we can’t avoid sickness and death.

177
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:48,600
If there is next life,
I really don’t want to be human.

178
00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:01,120
I only want to be with you forever.

179
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,640
I would wait for you.

180
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,280
Honey, I feel so bad.

181
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,960
Just let me go without pain, OK?

182
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,320
Sir, no!

183
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,000
Take the tael silver to buy medicine for aunt.

184
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,880
Are these enough?

185
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Kid, I appreciate your kindness.

186
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:07,720
But I am leaving.

187
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,400
Honey,

188
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
this is a good man.

189
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:31,800
You must pay him back
if you have the chance in the future.

190
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,680
Take…

191
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,960
…care.

192
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,560
Aunt died a natural death, which is a happy thing.

193
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,160
Please restrain your grief.

194
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,400
She and I have been together for 60 years.

195
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,280
We have never been apart.

196
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,080
The 60 years in human world have gone in a flash.

197
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,320
I should go.

198
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,640
Where are you going?

199
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,400
I’m going to the place I should go.

200
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,080
Don’t take it too hard.

201
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
If you want, you can
go to the military camp with me.

202
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,080
We soldiers lost our parents since childhood,

203
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,560
and we are willing to support you.

204
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,080
Your military camp is right in front.

205
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,120
You will get there after taking a turn.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,880
Thank you.

207
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,880
Young man,

208
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
you are kindhearted.

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,560
I,

210
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,640
I owe you a favor.

211
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,320
If you meet any difficulty in the future,
go to find me with it.

212
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
General, the old man looks weird.

213
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,680
You gave all your money.

214
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,920
Will you be cheated?

215
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,840
He doesn’t have children and just lost his wife.

216
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,080
He’s quite poor.

217
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,240
How could he

218
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,880
bury his dead wife beside a river

219
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,360
and leave?

220
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,240
In addition, this old woman

221
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,200
looks so much older than him.

222
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,800
General, I guess you were cheated.

223
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,920
I don’t plan to get back the money.

224
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,960
Just take it as a good deed.

225
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Aunt, I just met you once.

226
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,760
It’s just a trifle. I dare not accept it.

227
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,360
I’ll leave the seal for you.

228
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,000
Let’s go.

229
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,880
General, what happened to you?

230
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,480
General.

231
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,640
General, did that thing come back again?

232
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,880
I’m going to relieve myself.

233
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,040
Damn it. Why does it always go with me?

234
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,360
Is it immortal or monster?

235
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,360
Immortals,

236
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,800
I have never done any guilty deed

237
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,960
and I am open and poised.

238
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,800
Since he insisted giving me this gift,

239
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,280
I will accept it.

240
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,400
Please don’t go with me.

241
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family

242
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
will announce King Yi’s illness.

243
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,080
I will ask King Yi to abdicate and choose another wise king.

244
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
But Minister Fu…

245
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,400
If King Yi knows he can’t live long

246
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,440
and is unwilling to abdicate,

247
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,098
leaving Huaiwu’s future

248
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:09,320
and well-being of the people,

249
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,240
Minister Fu and others will not agree.

250
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
What did you say, Dad?

251
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,240
You go back first.

252
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,160
We are leaving.

253
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,360
King Yi is seriously ill
and doesn’t have any child.

254
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,120
He should abdicate and
hand over the regime as soon as possible.

255
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,400
If he dies one day suddenly,

256
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,800
the court and the state will be peaceful.

257
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,680
I guess you have planned this for a long time.

258
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,320
I guess the ministers

259
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,440
will recommend you

260
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
as the new king tomorrow.

261
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,960
I do so for the future of Huaiwu.

262
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,920
Sui He, I know

263
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,484
your passion for Xu Feng.

264
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:02,902
But as you can see,

265
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,520
even Saint Girl said he couldn’t be saved

266
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,480
and would die soon.

267
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
Why do you destroy the happiness of your life

268
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,160
for such a dying man?

269
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,920
Dad, Saint Doctors’ Family
has the best medical skill.

270
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,560
As long as Saint Girl is given more time,

271
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,280
she will be able to save my cousin.

272
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,640
Why are you so obsessive?

273
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,160
Think about it.

274
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,480
If I take the throne one day,

275
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,000
you will be the princess.

276
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,840
By then, you can choose any good man you want.

277
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,240
You will find a satisfactory husband.

278
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,600
Though the world is big, Cousin can’t be copied.

279
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,600
I only love Cousin.

280
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
No, I need to meet Cousin.

281
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Stop!

282
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,120
Qi Chong!

283
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,840
Your Excellency Duke.

284
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,760
Send princess back to her room.

285
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
Without my order,

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,080
she can’t leave the room.

287
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,800
Yes!

288
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,480
Princess, please.

289
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,880
Even if you bring my cousin down from the throne,

290
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,000
I will only marry him in my life.

291
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,040
Here comes His Majesty!

292
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,960
May you healthy, Your Majesty!

293
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,360
Stand up.

294
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,480
Thank you, Your Majesty!

295
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,040
What is the important thing today?

296
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,000
Your Majesty,

297
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,920
I originally couldn’t bear to

298
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,040
disturb Your Majesty when Your Majesty is ill.

299
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
This matter is related to fate of the state.

300
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,840
It really can’t be delayed.

301
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,886
What is so important?

302
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:58,387
Tell me.

303
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,320
Your Majesty is ill and doesn’t have any child.

304
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,760
In addition, it is a period of trouble.

305
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,920
So we believe

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,720
Your Majesty should put the state and people first

307
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,154
and abdicate to a virtuous man.

308
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,360
In this case,
we won’t fail the spirit of the ancestors.

309
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,800
You think I am ill
and can’t shoulder the important task.

310
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,627
The previous king died early.

311
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,870
Your Majesty acceded to the throne
at a very young age.

312
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,174
With a young king, the state was doubted,
with internal and external problems.

313
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,552
Fortunately, Duke Nanping
made vigorous efforts to turn the situation,

314
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:40,845
delivering the state from distress.

315
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,179
The former example is before our eyes.

316
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:44,807
Hope Your Majesty
can set store by overall interests.

317
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,892
Following the example of Yao and Shun’s abdication

318
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:48,143
has long been set in the fundamental principles.

319
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,280
According to you, if I don’t abdicate,

320
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,080
I will be a sinner of Huaiwu.

321
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,760
I dare not.

322
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,000
Then tell me.

323
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,840
If I abdicate, who can take over the throne?

324
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,840
We must recommend an upright wise king

325
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
who possesses both integrity and ability.

326
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,000
An upright wise king with integrity and ability?

327
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,600
I wonder if Duke Nanping
wants to form alliances with various dukes

328
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,040
or Minister Fu wants to unite the country.

329
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,640
Your Majesty, I deserve death.

330
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,280
If I have the intention to rebel,
I would stand condemned by God.

331
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,160
Your Majesty, I dare not.

332
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,520
Liu Si said so much to ask you to abdicate,
so he is guilty.

333
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,320
Please punish him, Your Majesty.

334
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,280
Your Majesty, my royalty
could be discerned by the sun and moon.

335
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,840
Mr. Liu,

336
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,680
you said I am seriously ill

337
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
and will die soon.

338
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,800
Where did you

339
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
get the news?

340
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,520
Recently, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
went to the palace to treat your illness.

341
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,520
We’ll know by asking her.

342
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,080
OK. Summon Saint Girl.

343
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,120
Summon Jin Mi, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family.

344
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Jin Mi, Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
pays a visit to Your Majesty.

345
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,360
Forego the formalities.

346
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

347
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,000
Tell me

348
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,440
what illness I have got.

349
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,720
Previously, Your Majesty
got up before dawn, ate late and overworked,

350
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,560
so he was indeed a little weak.

351
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,840
But,

352
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,240
after being nursed by me,

353
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,920
Your Majesty is strong and has recovered.

354
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,000
Your Majesty, I’ve received news
from the men sent to Saint Doctors’ Family.

355
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,680
How is it?

356
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,560
Everyone of Saint Doctors’ Family is safe.

357
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,120
Our men

358
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,240
are protecting them well.

359
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Duke Nanping’s men all died.

360
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,120
Duke Nanping is always careful and heartless.

361
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,480
Arrange more men to project Saint Girl.

362
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,760
Do not let Duke Nanping

363
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,440
get close to her.

364
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,960
Yes.

365
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Previously, you said

366
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,080
Your Majesty’s kidney yang and blood are weak,
so his six yang have problems.

367
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,560
As for this,

368
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,080
I was indeed inexperienced before,

369
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,200
so I made some erroneous judgment.

370
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,960
But these diagnoses are extremely private.

371
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,240
I remember I have never told Your Excellency these.

372
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,360
I wonder where Your Excellency got the news.

373
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,240
As Saint Girl, how could you make such an error?

374
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040
How dare you treat Your Majesty slightly?

375
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,240
Your Excellency Duke, please don’t be angry.

376
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,120
Your Majesty, I made such an error

377
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,600
because

378
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,120
someone tampered with Your Majesty’s diets.

379
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,760
The diets on the diet list seem nourish,

380
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,720
but their properties go against each other.

381
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,640
Most of them are strong drugs of
eighteen incompatibilities and nineteen counteractions.

382
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,920
If Your Majesty takes them for a long time,

383
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,800
the consequence will be unthinkable.

384
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,160
Where is the diet list from?

385
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,640
The diet list…

386
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,080
Your Majesty,

387
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,320
Saint Girl asked me
about the diet list some days ago.

388
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,196
I asked Dong Ruixi, Manager of Food Supervisor,

389
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:21,655
to copy one.

390
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,160
Now it seems

391
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,760
Dong Ruixi is very suspicious.

392
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,960
Summon Dong Ruixi.

393
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,200
Dong Ruixi, is the diet list made by you?

394
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,960
Your Majesty, it is made by me.

395
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,400
Do you know the tonic diets on it

396
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,400
would kill me?

397
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,720
Who is behind this?

398
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Tell me your accomplice, and I will spare you.

399
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,960
Your Majesty,

400
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
I don’t have accomplice

401
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
and I have never acted on anyone’s instigation.

402
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,000
Your Majesty, this man is vicious

403
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,720
and wanted to kill you invisibly.

404
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,440
He must been beheaded as a warning to others.

405
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,920
Your Majesty, this matter has many doubtful points.

406
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,280
I suggest putting Dong Ruixi into prison
and investigating this matter.

407
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
Put him into prison.

408
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,600
Go.

409
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,840
Go.

410
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,320
Minister Fu.

411
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,000
Here I am.

412
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,400
You’ll be responsible for this.

413
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,960
Officials.

415
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,160
When people have many “weapons,”
the sate will be in chaos.

416
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,560
When people have more skills,
strange things will appear.

417
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,960
Hope you can fulfill their duties

418
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,680
and learn from Duke Nanping

419
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,240
who is upright with both ability and integrity.

420
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,640
Having such an upright minister,
I am rather content.

421
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,160
Thanks for your praise, Your Majesty.

422
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,960
We will follow Your Majesty’s order.

423
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Your Excellency Duke,

424
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,680
the men sent to Saint Doctors’ Family lost contact.

425
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,196
Remember.

426
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,699
Do not let Dong Ruixi speak again.

427
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,240
I see.

428
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,640
Buddha,

429
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,680
please bless my cousin

430
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,280
to let him pass this disaster safely.

431
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Your Highness.

432
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,320
Your Highness.

433
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,440
Did you get some news?

434
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,080
The Meeting of Commanding Officers is over.

435
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,600
His Majesty is healthy.

436
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,760
Previously, his diets were tampered

437
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,480
so Saint Girl misdiagnosed.

438
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,800
So my cousin is healthy?

439
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,800
Saint Girl said His Majesty is very strong.

440
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,640
I know my cousin will be blessed

441
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
and will be fine.

442
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,520
Well, who tampered

443
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,360
my cousin’s diets?

444
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,040
It’s Dong Ruixi, Manager of Food Supervisor.

445
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,280
Does he have accomplice
or is he instructed to do it?

446
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
No, he did it alone.

447
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,880
This time, King Yi’s men arrived in time

448
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,690
and saved the whole Saint Doctors’ Family.

449
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:37,275
That’s really lucky.

450
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,080
He always keeps his word.

451
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,680
Now King Yi has recovered,

452
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,240
so you don’t need to act

453
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
and I don’t need to decoct medicinal herbs.

454
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,360
It’s indeed a little boring.

455
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,800
How about we go to listen to storytelling?

456
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,520
Recently, we have been trapped in Beiyuan Villa.

457
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,440
I feel so bored.

458
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,280
OK. Let’s go.

459
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Do you just leave?

460
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
Jin Mi, wait for me.

461
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,843
"Changhong Restaurant"
The God of War, King Yi, holding a long sword,

462
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,960
rode a horse towards the large number of soldiers.

463
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,600
He shouted

464
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
and the enemy became terror-stricken,

465
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,600
and suffered one defeat after another.

466
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,040
Great! Great!

467
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,800
Well said!

468
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,040
Well said!

469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,240
Right at that moment,

470
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,280
the leader of the enemy
came to the front of King Yi.

471
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,960
They both held long swords
and rushed to each other…

472
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,720
Wrong.
