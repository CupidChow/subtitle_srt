"Episode 62"

3
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,820
Fine, fine.

4
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,540
As a fruit,

5
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,250
I'll not argue with birds like you.

6
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,820
Phoenix,

7
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,400
I love you.

8
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,110
Now that you are gone,

9
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,080
Is there any reason for me to live alone in the world?

10
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm Jin Mi.

11
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,850
If you marry me in the future,

12
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,850
you may need to suffer some grievances.

13
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,740
Will you mind it?

14
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,450
I won't.

"Imperial Decree of My Sins"

16
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,910
Can we go back to the past?

17
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,910
No, we can't.

18
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,450
Perhaps,

19
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,110
we can make a fresh start.

20
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Jin Mi.

21
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,910
Ever since Jin Mi has gone,

22
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,080
he's always been like this.

23
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,310
He doesn’t say a word,

24
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,310
and looks neither like an immortal nor a demon,

25
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,080
just drowning his sorrows all day.

26
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,820
Xu Feng,

27
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,050
the Chief Peony has come to see you.

28
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,450
I'm the one who should be blamed for Jin Mi’s death.

29
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm sorry for her.

30
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,710
I'm sorry for Floral Realm too.

31
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,510
Don't say that, just get up.

32
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,050
Come on.

33
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,650
When the former Floral Immortal gave birth to Jin Mi,

34
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,480
she entrusted her to us.

35
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
We didn't take good care of her.

36
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,420
To say who should be blamed,

37
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
we should be the one to bear the unpardonable sin.

38
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,340
I'm the one who killed Jin Mi.

39
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,220
It's all my faults.

40
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,940
These days,

41
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,250
I've thought many things about Jin Mi.

42
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,250
Since the love doom is unavoidable,

43
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,740
there are a few things I should let you know.

44
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,310
Love doom?

45
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,310
I'm all ears.

46
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,310
In the last days, the former Floral Immortal

47
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,060
has predicted that

48
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,080
Jin Mi would have to go through
a love doom within ten thousand years.

49
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
That may be life threatening.

50
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So Jin Mi took the Yun Elixir at birth

51
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,400
to cut off her love.

52
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,420
At the night of Run Yu's mutiny,

53
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,480
she spit the Yun Elixir out after killing you by mistake.

54
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,340
I remember clearly

55
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,570
that when I was at death's door,

56
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,710
you said a word to me.

57
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,370
Never.

58
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,310
I still hold it as sacred by now

59
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,800
and bear it in mind.

60
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,370
That's because I ate the Yun Elixir.

61
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,570
I have cut my love feelings since I was born.

62
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,510
I didn't know what love was at that time.

63
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,740
Yun Elixir?

64
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,740
It is true.

65
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,050
The former Floral Immortal was intended to

66
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,880
protect her from the suffering of love and affection,

67
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,200
but didn't think this love doom

68
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,220
couldn't be avoided in the end.

69
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,280
So I'm the love doom of Jin Mi.

70
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,170
I let her be bothered by love and hurt by affection,

71
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,620
and finally fall into infinity.

72
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,200
I only thought she was cold-blooded.

73
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,450
It turns out she was affectionate but didn't realize that.

74
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,450
She didn't know that at all.

75
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,310
And I also never tried to know her.

76
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,650
I failed her.

77
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,020
In the past, I abided by the teachings
of the former Floral Immortal

78
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,650
and blindly stood in the way between you and Jin Mi.

79
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,310
I've come to understand it over these years.

80
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,940
You and Jin Mi really have a
transcendent and rare predestined relationship.

81
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,940
Your affection is deep and strong.

82
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,940
Now if I want to save the situation,

83
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,450
I can only put my hope on you.

84
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,280
You mean there's a hope to save Jin Mi?

85
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,850
What's your idea, Chief Peony?

86
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll be willing to go all out.

87
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,880
It's just

88
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,220
a glimmer of hope.

89
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,540
The former Water Immortal
told me one thing when he was alive.

90
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,680
He had taken Jin Mi to see the Xuan Ling Lord Doumu,

91
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,510
who had then predicted

92
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,200
what happened today.

93
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
She also gave incense ashes to protect Jin Mi.

94
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Perhaps,

95
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,540
she knows the way to help Jin Mi to revive.

96
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,200
I beg you

97
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,940
to remove the Garan Seal for my daughter.

98
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,940
She is a dying person.

99
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,220
There is no difference to unlock the Garan Seal.

100
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,770
May the incense ashes help you go through the doom.

101
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,680
That's great.

102
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,910
It's always good to have another way out.

103
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,050
Great.

104
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,850
I'll go and see the Lord Doumu immediately.

105
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,570
My respects, Lord Doumu.

106
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,940
You don't have to beg.

107
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,000
If you can do it, you don't need to beg to make it.

108
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,000
If you can't,

109
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,250
you'll fail even you beg for thousands of times.

110
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,310
I know that.

111
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,020
The consequences I caused myself

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,650
shall be taken by myself.

113
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,400
But,

114
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,170
I can't let go of it.

115
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,280
She has stuck in my mind

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,420
that I always think

117
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,140
it would be good to see her for another glance.

118
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,850
Even

119
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,570
hearing a word from her would be fine.

120
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,280
You also know that a glance or a word

121
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,620
can't remove your sorrow.

122
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,110
Even ten thousand glances and ten thousand words

123
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,450
will not make you contented.

124
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,370
The destiny is preordained by the Heaven.

125
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,200
Since you got such result, there must be a cause for it.

126
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,140
You can't go against the way of Heaven,
why do you insist like this?

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,310
These days,

128
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,420
although I know she is dead,

129
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,600
but I don't know why

130
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,200
I always feel that she is right by my side.

131
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,570
I have no other demands today,

132
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,820
but please give me some suggestions.

133
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,080
She may be not living

134
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,800
but she may be not dead, either.

135
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,820
In Heaven Realm, Human Realm and Demon Realm,

136
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,420
the different manifestations of all living creatures,
including love, hatred, sadness and misery,

137
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,420
are just wild fancy

138
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,880
and a delusion.

139
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,880
It's close at your sight.

140
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,620
What you see in your eyes
is right what you see in your mind.

141
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,140
What you see is exactly what she sees,

142
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,910
and what she sees is exactly what you see.

143
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,910
I don't quite understand.

144
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,600
Is there a slim chance of survival for Jin Mi?

145
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,970
You two meet and break up again and again,
and your fate begins and ends.

146
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,710
The destiny has been preordained.

147
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,480
In this world,

148
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,450
you miss each other but can't see each other.

149
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,600
you love each other but can't be together.

150
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,800
The fate has ended but you still hold together.

151
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,110
The fate has extinguished but you're not apart.

152
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,110
That is destiny.

153
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
Where can I find the primordial spirit of Jin Mi.

154
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,110
If you can't attain enlightenment,
the door of your wisdom won't open;

155
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,480
if you can, the door of your wisdom will open.

156
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,620
Thank you for your suggestion.

157
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,170
Here is the letter from Xu Feng.

158
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,340
Lord Doumu has reckoned that
some primordial spirit of Jin Mi

159
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,250
still survives in the world.

160
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,400
He has set out to find it.

161
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,650
Go tell the other chiefs

162
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,740
that we'll retreat

163
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
and use all forces of Floral Realm to look for it.

164
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,170
I'll go immediately.

165
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,820
All flowers and trees in the six realms
listen to my order now.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,020
You should try your best to
search for Jin Mi's primordial spirit from now on.

167
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,940
Once Jin Mi's primordial spirit is found,

168
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,600
we should open the Time Gallery,

169
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,080
trying everything to save Jin Mi.

170
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,970
Jin Mi.

171
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,200
Where are you?

172
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,880
You can't ask where her soul is,
and the way to the netherworld is long and deep.

173
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,600
Great.

174
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,600
Why do you say it's great?

175
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,340
She got away and attained great ease.

176
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,940
You're not her,

177
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,140
how do you know she attained great ease?

178
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,140
With her own power,

179
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,400
she suppressed the war
between the Heaven and the Demon.

180
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,620
Don’t you think it is a great wisdom and great ease?

181
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,080
You're right.

182
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,480
She was the most intelligent.

183
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,480
But when she was alive,

184
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,110
I never praised her.

185
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,680
The tables are turned.

186
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,450
She searched for you that year,

187
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,680
and now you are looking for her.

188
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,170
Why do you always have to leave your eternal regrets

189
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,910
in the Wangchuan River with endless sorrow and misery?

190
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,340
Phoenix.

191
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Phoenix.

192
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,780
Phoenix.

193
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,900
Please turn around and take a look at me, Phoenix.

194
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,220
Phoenix.

195
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,340
Phoenix.

196
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,420
Jin Mi.

197
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,540
Where are you?

198
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,850
Jin Mi.

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,080
Jin Mi.

200
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,620
Jin Mi.

201
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,420
Don't go.

202
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,540
Jin Mi.

203
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,910
Jin Mi.

204
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,910
Jin Mi.

205
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,820
Jin Mi.

206
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,000
Jin Mi.

207
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Jin Mi! Don't go.

208
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,540
Don't go.

209
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,110
Don't go.

210
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,770
Xu Feng, have you thought clearly?

211
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,540
I've made up my mind that I’m going to find Jin Mi.

212
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,800
I trust Demon Realm to you.

213
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,170
When you find Jin Mi,

214
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,020
I’ll return Demon Realm intact to you.

215
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,280
There's no need.

216
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,280
There's nothing

217
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,310
more important than her.

218
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,250
My respect, my lord.

219
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,480
The destiny is preordained by the Heaven.

220
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,970
Since you got such result, there must be a cause for it.

221
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,800
What you see in your eyes
is right what you see in your mind.

222
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
What you see is exactly what she sees,

223
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,050
and what she sees is exactly what you see.

224
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,710
Jin Mi.

225
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,600
Jin Mi.

226
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,250
I'll take you to see the Aurora in Demon Realm,

227
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,110
experience the glittering lights in Human Realm,

228
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,970
feel the beauty of four seasons in Floral Realm,

229
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,970
and taste all the fine food in the six realms.

230
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,170
Jin Mi.

231
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,910
I don't believe you're still willing to leave me

232
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,910
and the world.

233
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,220
In this world, you miss each other
but can't see each other.

234
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,570
The fate has ended but you still hold together.

235
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,940
The fate has extinguished but you're not apart.

236
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:08,914
Jin Mi.

237
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:13,657
If the time can turn backwards,

238
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,085
I'd rather not see you,

239
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:19,085
not miss you,

240
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:21,085
not love you,

241
00:24:22,285 --> 00:24:23,085
and not fail you.

242
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:26,285
I only hope

243
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,285
you're safe and sound in this world.

244
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,142
But you...

245
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,857
Where are you in the end?

246
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,622
Jin Mi.

247
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:44,622
Do you remember the place we declared our love?

248
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,733
The life in the mountain is easy;

249
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:51,155
while the prosperous world
has gone through thousands of years

250
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,155
At that time,

251
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:55,866
both you and I were mortal.

252
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,866
We were carefree,

253
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,400
and we felt the pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy.

254
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,622
We had no Yun Elixir and misunderstanding,

255
00:26:07,777 --> 00:26:09,111
nor hatred.

256
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:14,000
But we had the beautiful days we spent together,

257
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:19,422
and the most sincere feelings we shared together.

258
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:21,777
I miss those days very much.

259
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:25,333
I am thinking that when you come back,

260
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:28,444
we'll live as a mortal couple

261
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:30,888
that we’ll help and love each other,

262
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,555
and grow old together.

263
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:35,777
Okay?

264
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,111
I'll be waiting for you right here.

265
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:42,400
Wait for you to come back.

266
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:10,755
Your Highness!

267
00:27:12,044 --> 00:27:13,244
I've already joined Demon Realm.

268
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,022
I have nothing to do with Heaven Realm anymore.

269
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,177
Your Highness!

270
00:27:16,622 --> 00:27:17,688
I can't afford it.

271
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,688
Your Highness,

272
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,688
we come here today

273
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:23,688
to bother your Highness!

274
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:26,044
That's because we have
important things to discuss with you.

275
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,688
Heaven Realm and Demon Realm are at daggers drawn.

276
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,740
We'll just have disagreeable conversation.

277
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,700
There is no need to discuss.

278
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:34,177
I heard that your Highness
have resigned as the Demon Lord.

279
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,688
This time,

280
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:37,688
we come to beg you

281
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:40,577
to return to Heaven Realm and take over the reins.

282
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:44,266
Isn't there a person in charge in Heaven Realm?

283
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,288
His Majesty practiced the forbidden technique

284
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:49,866
and started the war between Heaven and Demon.

285
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,333
He doesn’t deserve the place by virtue.

286
00:27:51,822 --> 00:27:53,155
I'm afraid there'll be a disaster.

287
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,400
Days ago,

288
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:55,733
His Majesty has

289
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,977
announced his own sins through an edict.

290
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,844
We would like to support your Highness as the Lord.

291
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,600
And I hope Your Highness will bury the hatchet

292
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,355
and put the Heaven in the right way.

293
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,355
Your Highness.

294
00:28:59,688 --> 00:29:00,888
Your Highness.

295
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,444
You came in just right time.

296
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:53,377
Come on.

297
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,111
Do it.

298
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,222
Kill it.

299
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,866
Kill it.

300
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,111
Your Highness.

301
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:12,133
Your Highness. Don't do it.

302
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,866
He's locked himself up.

303
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:15,511
He won’t hurt anybody else.

304
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,422
Your Highness, I beg you.

305
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:20,222
He's got nothing now.

306
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,511
Kill it now.

307
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,511
If you want to make his Majesty

308
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,044
to be a walking dead body

309
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,044
You just stop me.

310
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:44,844
Your Majesty!

311
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,444
Your Majesty.

312
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:24,177
Your Majesty.

313
00:31:26,488 --> 00:31:28,088
How much more room have you left for maneuver?

314
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:31,422
Your Highness, I beg you.

315
00:31:32,577 --> 00:31:35,466
You spare His Majesty, I beg you.

316
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:37,155
You asked the Supreme Lord Lao to see me.

317
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:41,422
You let them overthrow our father at that time.

318
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,822
And today you let them overthrow you again.

319
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:46,088
Where exactly are you going to put yourself?

320
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:48,266
What do you think they should do now?

321
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,511
In my lifetime,

322
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:51,955
I hate betrayal most.

323
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:53,822
Have you ever thought that

324
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:57,066
the Heavenly Emperor changes,
the courtiers will change too.

325
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,133
How do you want me to do with this bunch of betrayers?

326
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:01,555
You won't.

327
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:04,666
From beginning to end,

328
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,111
it was all my fault.

329
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:10,266
The immortals were not involved in it.

330
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,133
By now,

331
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,666
do you still think that

332
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,444
everybody is your chess

333
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,444
that controlled by you

334
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,133
and maneuvered by you.

335
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,133
What do you think the throne of Heavenly Emperor is?

336
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:26,000
It's not what you want to
usurp and abandon as you wish.

337
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,000
You've endured hardships for
thousands of years to accomplish your ambition.

338
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,666
When you took your revenge

339
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:32,620
and enjoyed yourself enough as the Heavenly Emperor,

340
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,533
you want to walk away.

341
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,466
In the world,

342
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,577
how could there be such a good deal?

343
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,466
Kuang Lu, you can leave now.

344
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:54,180
I stole what was entrusted to my care,

345
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,460
practiced the forbidden technique secretly,

346
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,860
started the war,

347
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,220
and plunged the people into an abyss of misery.

348
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,044
I violated the law of the Heaven.

349
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:05,777
And now

350
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,088
someone should stand out

351
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,911
to initiate the useful and do away with the harmful.

352
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:14,400
You’re fire and I'm water. We are incompatible.

353
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,644
But we're both sons of our father.

354
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:21,422
If you stand out and bring order out of chaos,

355
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,822
that would be the best.

356
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,355
You've always led an honest and clean life,

357
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,844
you don't even care the eternal infamy now?

358
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:32,844
I’ve lived a solitude life.

359
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,022
My body and my primordial spirit will extinguish.

360
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,022
The undeserved reputation,

361
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:39,022
power and position

362
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:43,777
are merely as transient as a fleeting cloud to me.

363
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,666
How do I fear the infamy after death?

364
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:52,400
What I thought and schemed in the past

365
00:33:54,044 --> 00:33:58,133
was just to seek justice and take revenge.

366
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,444
As for killing our father and usurping the throne

367
00:34:01,466 --> 00:34:02,933
and imprisoning the Heavenly Empress,

368
00:34:04,088 --> 00:34:05,911
I have no regrets by now.

369
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:18,711
All what I said is just personal hatred.

370
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:21,066
I can't ruin Heaven Realm.

371
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:23,066
The public utility can't serve personal interests.

372
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,711
Right now,

373
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,222
it's time to make things right again.

374
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:33,155
You're talented and outstanding,
but you're also forthright.

375
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:37,555
You've made a lot of enemies in Heaven Realm.

376
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,622
Overthrow my tyranny and kill me.

377
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,622
It will be a meritorious deed.

378
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:46,400
After that,

379
00:34:47,644 --> 00:34:49,688
you can choose the able and
virtuous immortals to establish your court,

380
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:51,688
and support you to ascend the throne.

381
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:54,222
This would be what happens without extra effort,

382
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,177
and it can also help the situation
of Heaven Realm to transit stably.

383
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:12,177
That year,

384
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:15,822
our father granted me the Red Clouds Sword

385
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:19,777
to kill Qiong Qi

386
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,400
not for fratricidal fighting.

387
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:37,422
I was blinded by my obsession and hatred

388
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:39,955
and made irreparable mistakes.

389
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:44,133
Whatever punishment I should take,

390
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:46,133
I'll be willing to accept it.

391
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:48,355
Xu Feng,

392
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:52,355
this is a chance for you.

393
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:55,422
You shouldn't be softhearted.

394
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,444
You've weighed gains and losses
and racked your brains in scheming all your life.

395
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:02,266
What are you doing that for?

396
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:07,200
Don't you have nothing else in your mind?

397
00:36:14,177 --> 00:36:15,866
I also loved.

398
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,644
Xu Feng, I also loved.

399
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:22,488
It's just that

400
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:27,777
my love was too humble

401
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,222
that I always worried about personal gains and losses.

402
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:32,577
I wished, but I couldn't make it.

403
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:36,977
One day,

404
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:41,600
it cooled down suddenly.

405
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,022
leaving only hatred and jealousy

406
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:48,577
and the heart to win.

407
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:50,088
In the end.

408
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,600
In the end.

409
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,266
My heart has distorted so much
that even I felt disgusting of myself.

410
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,266
In my lifetime,

411
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:04,622
I could never escape my destiny of being despised.

412
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:06,711
Looking back,

413
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,488
what leaves behind is a big mess.

414
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:13,288
That's enough.

415
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:16,266
And I'm tired.

416
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:21,511
Do you think I will be obliged for you?

417
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,666
I told you early that

418
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,755
from beginning to end,

419
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:29,333
I have no intention of competing with you.

420
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:30,888
From beginning to end,

421
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:35,688
what I care in my mind is only Jin Mi.

422
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:42,222
Ironically,

423
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:46,133
I also only have Jin Mi in my heart.

424
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:48,400
I don't need you to be obliged.

425
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:52,000
It's all my faults.

426
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,422
The Yun Elixir in her body

427
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,222
was restored by me.

428
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:02,933
What did you say?

429
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:08,044
At that time,

430
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,044
when you two experience hardships in the mortal world,

431
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,844
the Yun Elixir in her body split.

432
00:38:14,488 --> 00:38:16,222
She fell deeply in love with you,

433
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:18,933
and you didn't know it at all.

434
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:24,577
However, I saw it clearly.

435
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:27,511
She always wanted to be with you,

436
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,511
and tried to break off the engagement with me.

437
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:31,911
I knew I had no hope.

438
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,311
But every time

439
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:41,422
when I saw her worry about you,

440
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,533
my mind was disturbed.

441
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:47,644
Seeing the date of wedding came close,

442
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:51,377
I'd rather let her not love anymore in her lifetime,

443
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,533
I must tie her to me.

444
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,533
In the end.

445
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,977
In the end, I hurt both of you,

446
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:00,977
making it beyond redemption.

447
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:08,533
So,

448
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,933
So her heart had never changed.

449
00:39:14,044 --> 00:39:15,555
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

450
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,933
Why do you say it till now?

451
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:24,622
I once thought we were well-matched.

452
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:27,688
As long as we kept our dignity

453
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,288
and our standpoint,

454
00:39:30,444 --> 00:39:31,777
we could just hold on

455
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,000
and stalemate like this.

456
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,244
One day, one of us would finally be the winner.

457
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:39,733
Till today, I get to know that

458
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,733
I was wrong.

459
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,911
We both were wrong.

460
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,066
I got the beginning wrong,

461
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:51,733
and you got he ending wrong.

462
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,577
We missed too many things.

463
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:03,466
If I met her first,

464
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,600
the outcome might be totally different.

465
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:11,466
You didn't miss it.

466
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:16,133
You did it wrong.

467
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:21,600
Haven't you even seen it through today?

468
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:23,600
At all times,

469
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:27,733
there's no triumph or defeat.

470
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,266
It's just about scheming,

471
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,200
which is a great taboo for love.

472
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:37,155
From beginning to end,

473
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:40,666
you didn't scheme a wrong step.

474
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,600
Just that I never scheme.

475
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:49,777
Now that she's gone,

476
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,733
what's the point of saying it?

477
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,844
This is left by Jin Mi.

478
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:11,866
She probably wanted to leave it to you.

479
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:26,755
At that time, to defeat you,

480
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:29,777
I pledged in blood with Qiong Qi.

481
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,088
So now,

482
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:37,200
I'm at the dead end and my time is running out.

483
00:41:37,866 --> 00:41:39,688
The Hairy Feather Jin Mi gave you

484
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:43,422
should have dissolved your countercharge by the elixir.
