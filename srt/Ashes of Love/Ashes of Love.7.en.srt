1
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,172
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,293
"Episode 7"

3
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,974
The food in Heaven Realm are bland.

4
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,319
After a long time, it feels dull.

5
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
Eating spicy and sweet food
once in a while...

6
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,160
is quite pleasurable.

7
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,714
Coming out from the Second Prince
who eats only fruits of bamboo,

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,560
only drinks from the purest spring,

9
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
that's rather interesting.

10
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,400
This again?

11
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
We always drink watery and
tasteless soup.

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Aren't you sick of it?

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,998
Must I eat vegetarian food just
because I'm a grape?

14
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,714
Besides,

15
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm also a vegetarian food.

16
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,885
How can I eat...

17
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,847
my own friends and relatives?

18
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,784
That's right.

19
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,135
This is a good one.

20
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,992
Your Highness, would you
like to try it?

21
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
It's really good.

22
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,287
Here.

23
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,014
Fairy Jin Mi.

24
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,121
No one has come to you yet?

25
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,229
Nothing. Eat up.

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,179
Why don't you come and eat too?

27
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
Here you are.

28
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,542
I've been looking for you everywhere.

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,831
Princess of Bian City.

30
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,024
How are you?

31
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,358
The last battle in
Wangchuan River was unsatisfying.

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
I heard that the Fire Immortal
is here today.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,760
I definitely wish to have
a battle with you.

34
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
Great! Great!

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,725
Great.

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
Great! Great!

37
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,976
People is doing business here.

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Let's go somewhere else.

39
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,120
Give your Demon Bone Whip
a full play.

40
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
Princess, please.

41
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,675
Princess,
don't pull your punches!

42
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,559
You know her?

43
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:39,490
Last time, by the
Wangchuan River,

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
Phoenix fought with...

45
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,263
a hundred thousand demon armies.

46
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,640
This montress was the first one,
and also the only one...

47
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,654
who dared to take up the gauntlet
with Phoenix.

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Although she is no match for Phoenix,

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,278
But she can still handle few moves.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,700
Enjoy it.

51
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,520
I see.

52
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:55,188
Princess.

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,360
Please.

54
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:04,238
It is said that,
the Princess of Bian City...

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,957
is skilled with bows and horse riding
since she was small.

56
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,039
She's known as the top female fighter
in Demon Realm,

57
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,279
whereas Xu Feng is known as
the God of Wars.

58
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:11,643
When two kings meet,

59
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
they should really compete.

60
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,451
Your Highness,

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,160
why haven't you drawn out
your sword yet?

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,703
Could it be that I, Liu Ying,
is not qualified to be your opponent?

63
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:38,985
You're humiliating me!

64
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,055
This princess is weird.

65
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,548
She loses her temper easily.

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
Phoenix gave her a head start
with 3 moves.

67
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,687
Even the last battle too.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,243
Fairy Jin Mi, you have no idea.

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,558
The Demon Realm honours martial arts.

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,558
There's a tradition among the fighters
in Demon Realm.

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,125
The greatest courtesy
to an opponent...

72
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:53,565
is to fight with all your might.

73
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,166
The Princess of Bian City is one of
the 3 kings in Demon Realm.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,920
King of Bian City's
only precious daughter.

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,011
She is a respected person
in Demon World.

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,276
It's difficult for her to find
a competitor.

77
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,483
I think Xu Feng gave her
a head start several times,

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,800
she's discredited.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,282
Phoenix is disgracing her!

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,920
- Why can't he just pull out the sword?
- Fairy Jin Mi.

81
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,144
The Red Clouds Sword
has matchless power.

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,998
Few supreme immortals of
Supreme Clarity Heaven...

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,920
molded and sealed it together.

84
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,689
It can kill immortals and deities,
destroys monsters and demons.

85
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,176
The Princess of Bian City comes from
Demon Realm.

86
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,790
She will easily be hurt by the sword.

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,760
As soon as the tip of the sword
touches her skin,

88
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,102
it will rot and decompose,

89
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,500
turn into ashes and smoke.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
I see.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,280
I never point my sword at my friends,

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,469
but only the enemies.

93
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,151
Thank you, Princess.

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,322
After I return,

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,518
I will train for another
300 to 500 years.

96
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,672
Then, we'll fight again.

97
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,360
I haven't even had my breakfast yet.

98
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,517
But you've forced me to fight.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
Is this how the Palace of Bian City...

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,280
treat their guests?

101
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,398
Your Highness, how could you say that?

102
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,053
The Night Immortal and you came
from far away,

103
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,615
but you didn't send anyone
to notify us.

104
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,581
My father received a letter from
King of Yan City early morning,

105
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,586
only then he commanded me
to hurry here.

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
You stay in such a shoddy inn.

107
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:07,600
People might think that...

108
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,720
my father and I
mistreat you on purpose.

109
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,080
You are well-proportioned.

110
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,000
You must be the Night Immortal.

111
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,094
Liu Ying pays respect to
the Night Immortal.

112
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Princess, please forgive us.
To be honest,

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,741
this time, we do not come to
Demon Realm...

114
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:22,943
for a tour,

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,529
but for a legal case.

116
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:25,847
If we disturb you,

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,381
it might cause you inconvenience.

118
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,933
That's not necessary.

119
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,933
It must be due to the Fire Immortal...

120
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,303
is fond of someone.

121
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,080
So he purposely stays away
from monstresses like me.

122
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,759
Princess, why did you say so?

123
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,855
Just now in the yard,

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,080
I saw the Beast of Dreams was feeding
on a dream.

125
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
The lady in the dream...

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,091
seems close to the Second Prince.

127
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
Could it be...

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,720
that's the person that you like?

129
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,980
That's none of my business.

130
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,207
I didn't tell her.
I didn't do that.

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,727
My Beast of Dreams...

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,680
has the ability to access to Heaven...

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,255
but it can never break the barrier of
the Second Prince.

134
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,600
Is it possible that...

135
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,656
last night the Second Prince
was careless...

136
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:12,640
and forgot to set up the barrier,
hence the beast stole the dream?

137
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,089
Well, I think,

138
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,038
it must be you who'd forgotten
to set up the barrier,

139
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,640
that was why the Beast of Dreams...
ate your erotic dream.

140
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,624
Fish Fairy.

141
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,019
The Night Immortal is already engaged.

142
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,253
If his reputation is spoiled by
a little immortal like you,

143
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,720
How can Qi Wu Palace
take this responsibility?

144
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,993
Come here.

145
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,558
I've heard about it for a long time,
that Heavenly Emperor...

146
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,118
has set an engagement
for the Night Immortal.

147
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,618
I wonder which lady in
the six realms...

148
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,760
has such a privilege?

149
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,709
The eldest daughter of Water immortal.

150
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,560
The eldest daughter of Water immortal?

151
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,260
Aren't Water immortal and Wind immortal
Immortal still childless?

152
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,140
Fish Fairy.

153
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,047
So the Empress, your lawful wife
hasn't been born yet?

154
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,800
That Empress
is too ungracious!

155
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,320
Shut up.

156
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,578
Fairy Jin Mi was right.

157
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,296
When I see her,

158
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
I will definitely ask her about it.

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm flattered.

160
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,766
Capturing Qiong Qi
is of utmost importance.

161
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,240
My father purposely sent me here,

162
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,686
to assist both of you
to capture Qiong Qi.

163
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,800
Princess, with all due respect,

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,710
this time, capturing Qiong Qi
is just one of the missions.

165
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,005
The most important thing is,
we want to find out...

166
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,894
the truth behind Qiong Qi's flee.

167
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,398
The tool which sealed up Qiong Qi...

168
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,273
The Melding Soul Cauldron of
Xuan Ling Lord Doumu.

169
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
It's an ancient divine artifact.

170
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,974
If no one unsealed it,

171
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
with only Qiong Qi's ability,
it would never escape.

172
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,920
All these years when it's sealed up,

173
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,768
nothing ever went wrong.

174
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
Now that he escaped out of the blue,

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
that's rather suspicious.

176
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,514
I, Liu Ying can swear by the Heaven,

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,280
The Palace of Bian City
has nothing to do with this.

178
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,695
I've known your father for
a long time.

179
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,157
I know his behaviour very well,
I will not suspect him.

180
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
As for the outsider...

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,440
No matter what,
this investigation has to be fair,

182
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,918
so that it doesn't
set tongues wagging.

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,238
That's why the Night Immortal and I
decided...

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
not to disturb your father.

185
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:17,954
Don't worry.

186
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,575
I've moved here this morning.

187
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,258
I am at your service at all times.

188
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,680
Thank you, Princess.

189
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
What happened today?

190
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,240
Phoenix. Phoenix.

191
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,086
When are we going to capture Qiong Qi?

192
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,392
If we are not going
to capture him yet,

193
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,720
why don't you teach me...

194
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,359
some unique secret scriptures?

195
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,840
Unique secret scriptures?

196
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,280
Let me ask you.

197
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,854
Have you memorised
Sasa Mantra by heart?

198
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,367
Formless Heart Sutra?

199
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:04,215
What about Brahma Spell?

200
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,444
When you're out there,

201
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,518
don't tell people that
you come from Qiwu Palace.

202
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,727
Don't bring disgrace
to the reputation of Qiwu Palace.

203
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,040
I can't risk that.

204
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,190
Your Highness, Your Highness.

205
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,899
Would you like some raisins?

206
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,376
These raisins...

207
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,960
are soft, sticky and firm,
the sweetness is just right,

208
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,612
They are the highest grade of raisins.

209
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:26,733
Eat it.

210
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,601
Why do you like raisins so much?

211
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,311
Well, we are what we eat.

212
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,498
Ridiculous.

213
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:43,529
Phoenix, Phoenix.

214
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,651
By the way, who was the
fairy in your erotic dream?

215
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,209
Who was the fairy...

216
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,854
that has the privilege...

217
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,280
to win you over?

218
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,128
There's no such person.

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,257
Forget it.

220
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,958
It doesn't matter if you
don't want to admit it.

221
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,280
I saw it anyway.

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
The lady in your dream...

223
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,880
looks just like me.

224
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,240
I can simply ask around,

225
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:05,863
and I'll find out who she is.

226
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,320
That was you.

227
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,557
What?

228
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,678
Me?

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,437
But don't over think it.

230
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,049
It wasn't an erotic dream.

231
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
That was just
an ordinary dream.

232
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,529
Don't flatter yourself.

233
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,452
Who would kiss you in your dream?

234
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,961
Didn't you see properly?

235
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,748
Actually, I was biting you.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,680
Why would you bite me?

237
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
I remember that I'd told you before.

238
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,578
My true form is a bird.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,880
I love eating fruits.

240
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,381
You don't practice mantras properly
and improve on your spiritual prowess.

241
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,781
But you got yourself into troubles
no matter where you go.

242
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
I really wish to...

243
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,669
peel off your grape skin,

244
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,000
dry you under the sun,
chew you into pieces...

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,520
and eat you.

246
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,548
I'm doomed.

247
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,821
He wanted to eat me
even when he's dreaming.

248
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,251
My life is at stake.

249
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,438
Only if I knew this earlier,

250
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,999
I would have gone back to
The Water Mirror with Mr. Hu.

251
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,240
Seems like she's intimidated.

252
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,023
Did I scare her?

253
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,836
Of course we can't take a dream
too seriously.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
This will be a lesson for you.

255
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,912
Next time,

256
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,232
if you dare to peek
a supreme immortal's dream again,

257
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,120
I will never let you off easily.

258
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,680
Also,

259
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,680
if a third party knows
about this,

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,560
I will never let you off.

261
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,389
Wait, wait.
Don't you know how to count?

262
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,764
You, Fish Fairy and me,
and also Liu Ying,

263
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,447
that'd be 4 people.

264
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:36,056
- You...
- Your Highness, you're right.

265
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,918
Your Highness, you're right.
Everything you said is right.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,200
You... You...
Your Highness, in the six realms,

267
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,490
you're the most handsome man,

268
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,864
you're also the nicest man.

269
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,040
Please don't turn me into...

270
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,209
stone bench,

271
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,741
cabbage and what not again.

272
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,466
And please don't bite me again.

273
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,381
Don't bite me even when
you're dreaming.

274
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,954
Your Highness,

275
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,710
Fish Fairy,

276
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,558
Demon Servants who were patrolling
the mountain said that,

277
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,452
around the foothill of Mount Chi Ren,
they've found traces of Qiong Qi.

278
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,019
- Princess, please bring us there.
- Let's go.

279
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
Come on.

280
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
- You're not allowed to go.
- Why?

281
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:17,949
Qiong Qi is ferocious, cunning,
he is extremely powerful.

282
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:19,687
You'll just mess things up
if you go there.

283
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,280
Let me go.

284
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,161
Fairy Jin Mi.
Qiong Qi is exceptionally ferocious,

285
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,329
I think you better listen to him,

286
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,791
it's safer if you stay here.

287
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,960
Whereas capturing Qiong Qi
just leave it to us.

288
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Fish Fairy.

289
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,376
Fish Fairy, let me out.

290
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,638
It's useless no matter who you beg.

291
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,918
Today you better stay here
and learn Sasa Mantra by heart.

292
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,375
I'll put you to the test
after I return.

293
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,533
Phoenix.

294
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,480
Fish Fairy.

295
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,925
“Chiren Mountain”

296
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
The soil here...

297
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,960
doesn't smell burnt.

298
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,080
It doesn't seem to be caused by
the lava.

299
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,078
Indeed.

300
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,120
Qiong Qi's blood is highly toxic.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
Anything that touches it...

302
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,400
will decoy and turn into black,
just like being burnt.

303
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Seems like...

304
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,040
it is caused by Qiong Qi's
blood drops.

305
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
Your Highness, do you mean...

306
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,000
Qiong Qi is hiding somewhere nearby?

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,640
Qiong Qi's true form is enormous.

308
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
I wonder...

309
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,720
if there's such a cave...

310
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
which can fit his true form.

311
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,550
Come with me.

312
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,040
What is this smell?
It smells so bad.

313
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,113
That day,
outside the Southern Heavenly Gate,

314
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:19,878
Qiong Qi was injured
after Xu Feng beat him up.

315
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,190
I'm afraid his wound
deteriorates and forms pus.

316
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,481
This is the largest cavern
in Mount Chi Ren.

317
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,762
Apparently, Qiong Qi
is hiding in there.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,101
We are not familiar with
the surroundings inside the cavern.

319
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:34,118
Besides, he's hiding
and we're exposing ourselves here.

320
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,697
If we walk into the cavern hastily,
it might be dangerous.

321
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,931
What if...
I lure him out with Demon Bone Whip?

322
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,266
Lure him out,
then 3 of us can work together...

323
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,592
and kill it.

324
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,373
But after Qiong Qi dies,

325
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,558
his flesh and bones will turn into
toxic liquid.

326
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,661
The land within a thousand miles will
turn into scorched soil.

327
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,918
All the living creatures
will live in misery.

328
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,080
Even ghosts and goblins will
be difficult to survive.

329
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,342
So,

330
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,673
we cannot kill him
with an ordinary way.

331
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,458
We have to look for another way,

332
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,189
remove his demonic element first,

333
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
and then seal him inside
the Melding Soul Cauldron again.

334
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,956
That was an good idea.

335
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,360
But how can we do that?

336
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,160
The King of Yan City
has a Demon Dagger,

337
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,161
it can remove its demonic element.
Why don't we ask it from him?

338
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,958
The King of Yan City
treasures it as if that's his life.

339
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,782
It's impossible...

340
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:19,367
for him to lend it to someone
who isn't from Demon Realm.

341
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,486
What if I ask my father
to be the guarantor?

342
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,116
We might have another chance.

343
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,889
We'd appreciate the help from
The King of Bian City.

344
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,077
Please.

345
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,200
I wasn't expecting the Fire Immortal...

346
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
and the Night Immortal
to come here.

347
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,776
I'm sorry for didn't welcome you.

348
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,687
King of Yan City, King of Gucheng.

349
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,256
Here, Your Highness.

350
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,836
- Please come in.
- Please.

351
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,258
- Please.
- Please.

352
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:04,794
Recently,

353
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
I've also been worried about
Qiong Qi's return.

354
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,698
Luckily Heavenly Emperor...

355
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:12,781
have sent Your Highness...

356
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,120
to give us help.

357
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Then, Your Highness, please...

358
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,600
kill Qiong Qi...

359
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
and put an end to the trouble.

360
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,600
King of Yan City, please listen to me.

361
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,268
We must not kill Qiong Qi.

362
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:24,968
Otherwise, the poison
after his death...

363
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,746
will be a disaster in Demon Realm.

364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,996
So, Your Highness,

365
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,000
are you helpless too?

366
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:35,049
Back then, Supreme Immortal, Lord
Doumu seal it inside the Melding Soul Cauldron.

367
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,558
But Supreme Immortal
meditates in seclusion,

368
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,918
he will not return
to the world easily.

369
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,223
So I have come here...

370
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,651
to borrow Demon Dagger...

371
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,047
from King of Yan City...

372
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,925
to seal Qiong Qi again.

373
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,440
The Fire Immortal
has won every battle,

374
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,071
and can fight against
100,000 demon armies on his own,

375
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,818
Qiong Qi alone...

376
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,360
would be nothing.

377
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,798
I believe,

378
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,120
with both of your powers,

379
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,480
you can definitely capture
the ferocious beast.

380
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,540
If I use my magical prowess
to seal it,

381
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,040
I have no other opinions.

382
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,600
But there's one thing...

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,480
that I wish all of you know.

384
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,207
Please enlighten me.

385
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,040
If we return without
accomplishing anything,

386
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,078
how should the Night Immortal and I
explain it to Heavenly Emperor...

387
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,960
would be a minor issue.

388
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,520
But, when the city gate is on fire,
the fish in the moat will suffer.

389
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:28,631
Qiong Qi lived in Demon Realm
for a long time.

390
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,135
Once he goes mad and rebels,

391
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,490
his first target...

392
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,080
would definitely be Demon Realm.

393
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,758
In the future, when the six realms
live in misery,

394
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,800
people will start tracing the cause
of Qiong Qi's escape.

395
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,682
When the six realms question you,

396
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:42,798
King of Yan City,
how will you defend yourself?

397
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,400
Of course that's because he's cunning,

398
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,811
he has amazing magical prowess.

399
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:51,038
Melding Soul Cauldron...

400
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,823
was molded from ancient mithril.

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,438
And Lord Doumu had
incanted and sealed it.

402
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,575
If it weren't for someone
who broke the seal,

403
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,147
it's definitely difficult...

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,720
for a struggling beast to escape.

405
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,175
Your Highness,

406
00:20:05,918 --> 00:20:07,758
you are wrong.

407
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,791
The chaos occurs in King of Yan City's
Earth Realm.

408
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,265
Aren't you afraid of
being accused as...

409
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,960
doing an inside job?

410
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,240
Your Highness,

411
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,200
you can't sling mud at me!

412
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:19,969
I wasn't.

413
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,004
King of Yan City,
you know it very well.

414
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,442
How can you stop the people...

415
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,678
in Heaven and Earth
from creating rumours,

416
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,360
you better think carefully.

417
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,960
King of Yan City,
please cease from anger.

418
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,996
The Fire Immortal was only talking about
the current situation,

419
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
he didn't mean to offend
your good self.

420
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,285
But we suspect,

421
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,400
someone in Demon Realm released
Qiong Qi on purpose,

422
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,080
he has evil intentions,
brings chaos to six realms,

423
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:47,722
intends to stir up strife...

424
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,327
between Demon Realm with other realms.

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,920
It's still not too late
to mend the mistake.

426
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,798
Now, no one has found out
King of Yan City's liable for it...

427
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,840
for your improper security.

428
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,199
If King of Yan City...

429
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
can let go of sectarian views,

430
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,030
make amends for your past fault,
We can definitely capture Qiong Qi...

431
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,536
giving back peace to the six realms,

432
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,920
and clear Demon Realm's name.

433
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,480
Your Highness,

434
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,712
I will definitely investigate
this matter,

435
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,294
and give everyone in six realms
an explanation.

436
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,843
King of Yan City, thank you
for being understanding.

437
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,823
Now, the urgent task on hand...

438
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,400
is to capture Qiong Qi.

439
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,852
We hope you can give away
your treasure,

440
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,400
lend us the Demon Dagger.

441
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,911
Your Highness,

442
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,440
it's not my intention
for not lending you.

443
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:29,825
Since ancient times,

444
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,544
the royals in Demon Realm
have been guarding...

445
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:33,982
the Demon Dagger for generations.

446
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,118
We've never made any exception
to lend it to anyone.

447
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,366
This is easy.

448
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,040
The Demon Realm just has to
send a royal...

449
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,640
and go with both of us...

450
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,840
to subdue Qiong Qi,

451
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,880
in this way, we'll not break the rules
in Demon Realm.

452
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,278
Demon Lord.

453
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,118
I am the princess of Demon Realm,
I should share Demon Lord's burden.

454
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,148
I plead, I'm willing
to capture Qiong Qi...

455
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,295
with the Fire Immortal and Night
Immortal subdue that evil beast.

456
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,663
That's right, Demon Lord.

457
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,280
Liu Ying has always been reliable.

458
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,391
If she takes care of the Demon Dagger,

459
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:06,614
it should be fine.

460
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,917
Nonsense!

461
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,798
If people know that Demon Realm sends
outsiders and a woman...

462
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,880
to fight against Qiong Qi,

463
00:22:12,257 --> 00:22:14,988
when the word spreads,
other people will laugh at us,

464
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,759
saying that Demon Realm
has no one else.

465
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
Princess Liu Ying
is no inferior to men.

466
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,104
If she can assist,

467
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,800
we can definitely capture Qiong Qi.

468
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,378
Demon Lord,

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,149
both of your sons are highly skilled.

470
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,739
Why don't you let both of your sons...

471
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,280
to bring Demon Dagger...

472
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,120
and go with the Fire Immortal
and the Night Immortal?

473
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,600
I've always wanted
to let both of my sons...

474
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:45,909
to experience and train.

475
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,320
But they never had a good opportunity.

476
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,120
Now that the Fire Immortal
and the Night Immortal...

477
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,535
will be guiding them,

478
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,378
I will be at ease...

479
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,245
even though the opponent is Qiong Qi.

480
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,802
Xuan Shou, Chi Shou.

481
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,211
Father.

482
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,072
I command the both of you,

483
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:08,120
to bring along Demon Dagger
and seal Qiong Qi...

484
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,360
together with the Fire Immortal
and the Night Immortal.

485
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,200
Qiong Qi means nothing to us.

486
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:13,724
Father,

487
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,796
just wait for us to
return with victory.

488
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
Yes.

489
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,118
We will definitely show both
Supreme Immortals...

490
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
the power of Demon Realm.

491
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:23,495
Demon Lord.

492
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,513
Subduing Qiong Qi isn't
a child's play.

493
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,229
I'm afraid two princes...

494
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,654
will have to take care of it.

495
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,240
I plead to let me go along.

496
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Fine.

497
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,640
Since you're loyal,

498
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,232
go with them.

499
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,817
In that case,

500
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,400
thank you, King of Yan City,

501
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:48,155
appreciate the help from
the two princes...

502
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,600
and the Princess of Bian City.

503
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:03,674
Those worthless fellows from Yancheng,

504
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,800
they will only be our burden.

505
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,040
I thought we'd capture Qiong Qi soon,

506
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,459
who knows,

507
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,503
now we have to stall off
the two princes.

508
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,248
Leave those worthless fellows to me.

509
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,257
Your Highness,

510
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:16,160
don't be distracted by
King of Yan City.

511
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,360
- We better think of a way
- to lure Qiong Qi out.

512
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,455
Qiong Qi has been wicked and cunning,

513
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
if you use Demon Bone Whip
to lure him out,

514
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,240
he might put up his guard.

515
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
We might not be able
to lure him out then.

516
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,800
What if we use food
and herbs as a bait?

517
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,760
Qiong Qi is now injured.

518
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,600
He is in need of food and herbs
to regain his strength.

519
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
Qiong Qi has been feeding on
human's infants.

520
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,360
We can't just sacrifice
a human's infant...

521
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,607
just to capture Qiong Qi.

522
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
- Of course we won't do that.
- Then what should we do?

523
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,691
I've read about something
in ancient books,

524
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,478
It is said that Qiong Qi loves
eating Lingzhi.

525
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,277
It's not a verified statement,
but we can give it a try.

526
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:53,969
Lingzhi?

527
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,275
I can grow Lingzhi.

528
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,529
- Grow Lingzhi?
- You can't do this.

529
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,680
Why can't I?
You've seen it before.

530
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:04,522
Moreover, who else can do it...

531
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:05,642
besides me?

532
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:07,071
Qiong Qi is too ferocious.

533
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,822
I won't let you take this risk.

534
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,440
It's fine.

535
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,645
You can protect me.
Am I right?

536
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,154
I didn't know that Fairy Jin Mi
has such a magical trick.

537
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,404
As expected from Heaven Realm
which has so many talents.

538
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,320
Girl, why don't you just stay in
Yancheng Palace?

539
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
Grow hundred of Lingzhi every day,

540
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,870
we'll sell them in Heaven Realm
and mortal world,

541
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,443
we'll earn lots of money.

542
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:12,833
That's right.

543
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,446
Hundreds of Lingzhi?

544
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,039
You're selling Lingzhi from
Heaven Realm like a carrot.

545
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,651
Then we'll sell you.

546
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,280
A little fairy like you
who can grow Lingzhi...

547
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
would cost quite
some magical prowess.

548
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,721
Shut up.

549
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,520
One more word,

550
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,520
and I will feed him to Qiong Qi.

551
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,482
Xu Feng.

552
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,691
Brother.

553
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,404
Fairy Jin Mi, it's about time.

554
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,128
No, it's not enough.

555
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,209
I must plant more of it,

556
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,830
make sure we manage to lure him out.

557
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,396
Seems like Qiong Qi is coming out.

558
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,984
We better take shelter.

559
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,280
Brother. Don't fool around
with them anymore.

560
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
If we don't hide now,
we will be Qiong Qi's food.

561
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,080
That's right.

562
00:27:28,922 --> 00:27:29,923
Let's hide first.

563
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,947
Let's go. Hurry.
Let's hide.

564
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,268
Go and lay in ambush
with Liu Ying.

565
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,830
We'll wait for Fairy Jin Mi.

566
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,146
I will protect her.
Go ahead.

567
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,798
You must protect yourself too.

568
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,842
Jin Mi.

569
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
It's about time, we should go.

570
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,663
No, that's not enough.

571
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,669
This time,

572
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,353
I must lure Qiong Qi out...

573
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,080
and avenge for Rou Rou.

574
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,970
Let's go.

575
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Wait!

576
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:18,525
I haven't finished growing them!

577
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,732
Wait.

578
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,160
I haven't finished growing that one.

579
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,238
I told you I haven't finished
growing them.

580
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,552
How dare you say that!

581
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,764
The end of natural law,
the convene of sun and moon.

582
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,560
To come and to go
are obscure and subtle.

583
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,280
Demon Dagger!

584
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,520
Fairy Jin Mi!

585
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,920
What did you scatter on him?

586
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,000
Cactus thorns with pollen.

587
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,400
Careful!

588
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
Watch out!

589
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,080
Use the Demon Dagger!

590
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,920
How should I use this?

591
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,366
Repeat after me.

592
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,040
The end of natural law,
the convene of sun and moon!

593
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,160
The end of natural law,
the convene of sun and moon!

594
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,760
To come and to go
are obscure and subtle.

595
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,320
To come and to go
are obscure and subtle!

596
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,360
All the beasts and demons...

597
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,560
All the beasts and demons...
what's next?

598
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,240
Will be perished!

599
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,516
Will be perished!

600
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:29,367
- Fairy Jin Mi.
- Fairy Jin Mi.

601
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,594
Jin Mi.

602
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:33,895
Farewell.

603
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:36,316
Phoenix.

604
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,840
Please apologise to Chief Peony
on my behalf.

605
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
Tell her that,

606
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,024
in my next life...

607
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,000
It is Qiong Qi's blood.

608
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,080
I know.

609
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,800
The poison has sunk in...

610
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,000
my bones, right?

611
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,407
You did a great job.

612
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:54,807
You managed to seal it.

613
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,510
The Demon Dagger...

614
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,415
has cleared Qiong Qi's toxic blood.

615
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,759
I was amazing!

616
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,082
The Melding Soul Cauldron with the seal
of Nine Luminaries Fire,

617
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,099
Qiong Qi will never be able to
get away this time.

618
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:46,143
I want to bring the Melding Soul Cauldron back
to Heaven Realm,

619
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:49,317
ask father to destroy Qiong Qi.

620
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,599
Qiong Qi's escape wasn't an accident.

621
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,681
If we leave the Melding Soul Cauldron
in Demon Realm,

622
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,103
with a fire seal,

623
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,503
it's still useless.

624
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,400
Your Highness,

625
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,480
who do you think is
the most suspicious?

626
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,240
We don't have a proof,

627
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,240
but there's one man
who is the most suspicious.

628
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
Do you mean...

629
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,640
Your Highness,

630
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,680
please don't keep me guessing.

631
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
Who are you talking about?

632
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,040
We're just guessing.

633
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,880
We need to verify it by investigation.

634
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,002
When we find the truth,

635
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,623
we will tell you.

636
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,316
The Heavenly Dog will eat
the moon tonight.

637
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:30,783
I will get back to my night duty.

638
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:32,611
Prince Xuan Shou is badly injured.

639
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,881
You have to be careful...

640
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,643
when you deal with King of Yan City.

641
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:36,825
Also,

642
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:38,508
when you were saving Fairy Jin Mi,

643
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,806
you were hit by Qiong Qi.

644
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,967
Take a rest.

645
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:43,619
After you go back,

646
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:44,924
don't tell father and mother...

647
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,032
about my injury.

648
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,086
Don't worry.

649
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,760
Excuse me, Princess.

650
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,200
Xuan Shou!

651
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:02,854
My son!

652
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
What happened to you?

653
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,263
Fire Immortal!
