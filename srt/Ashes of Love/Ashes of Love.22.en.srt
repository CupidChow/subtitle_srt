"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 22"

3
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
It was probably Duke Nanping

4
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,580
who poisoned my food

5
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,580
and colluded with Liangguo people
in ambushing me before.

6
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,799
How ambitious he is!

7
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,926
I must get back to get rid of him soon.

8
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Why does my heart beat so fast

9
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
and feel so sore?

10
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,120
I’ve never felt like this before.

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,360
It was urgent, so I offended you.

12
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,320
Since we were separated by the veil,
you didn’t offend me.

13
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,920
Never mind.

14
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,803
" Dongting Lake"

15
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
My Lord. My Lord.

16
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,120
Yong, Lian, how’ve you been?

17
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,800
My Lord, please behave yourself.

18
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
Master has been waiting for you for a long time.

19
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,660
You’re so boring and monotonous.

20
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,568
"Yunmeng Lake "

21
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,180
Master, how have you been doing recently?

22
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,040
You haven’t been back since Rat Fairy died.

23
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,740
If I didn’t summon you today,

24
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,500
you would never

25
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,020
step in Yunmeng Lake again, right?

26
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,260
I don’t dare.

27
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,020
You don’t dare?

28
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
Maybe you don’t dare,

29
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,660
but you have such an idea.

30
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,660
My sincerity to you is visible.

31
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,040
I know the death of Rat Fairy
was a heavy blow to you,

32
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,860
but since he was dead,

33
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,400
it’s useless to dwell on the past.

34
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,580
You should look ahead

35
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
and let it go.

36
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,580
What’s your order, Master?

37
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,220
Get up.

38
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,680
I got the message that

39
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow appeared again.

40
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,180
Go to snatch it

41
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,860
and kill Xu Feng for me.

42
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,196
Oh, my Gosh!

43
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,640
My adopted mother always does whatever she likes.

44
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,740
It sounds like Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

45
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,960
is just a knife in her kitchen

46
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,860
and Xu Feng is a chick raised by her.

47
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,680
Mom, I’m afraid I can’t do it.

48
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,760
Rat Fairy and I got help from outside or in last time,

49
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,180
but we still failed to kill Xu Feng

50
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
and Rat Fairy even died because of this.

51
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,620
I really don’t have confidence

52
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
that I can get rid of Xu Feng alone.

53
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,700
He’s a mortal now

54
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,280
and even weaker than he was during nirvana.

55
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,261
Since the great cause is unachieved,

56
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,014
someone must die for it.

57
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,340
How can you give it up just for his death?

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,980
Did you just regard Rat Fairy

59
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,920
as a pawn?

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,140
I know you don’t agree with my behavior,

61
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,000
but we have no way to back down.

62
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,740
Rat Fairy was loyal to me

63
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,960
and masterminded with painstaking effort
in Heaven Realm for so many years

64
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,520
so as to collect a lot of precious information for us.

65
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,300
If we give up halfway,

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,140
we’ll fail him.

67
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,580
Before Rat Fairy died for justice,

68
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,580
he repeatedly asked me to tell you

69
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,500
haste makes waste.

70
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,760
Water Immortal saved you

71
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,720
from Heavenly Empress despite everything

72
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,360
and offered you this place to live.

73
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,840
You just mentioned that

74
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,700
it is useless to

75
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,400
dwell on the past.

76
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,740
Why do you

77
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,120
get yourself into endless hatred

78
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,120
and implicate more innocent people?

79
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,120
Cut it out.

80
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Stop telling me

81
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,740
an eye for an eye

82
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,180
will only make the whole world blind.

83
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,115
In such a big world,

84
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,035
I may still exist, but I have ceased to live,

85
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,440
and have nowhere to make my home.

86
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Have you ever tried to

87
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,360
live on the charity and compassion of others?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
You saved me,

89
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,500
so I’ll die for you without any hesitation.

90
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,500
After Rat Fairy died,

91
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
I’ll still pledge allegiance to you.

92
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,700
If I die,

93
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,520
I wonder who will pledge allegiance to you.

94
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,780
Yan You, I can only depend on you.

95
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,440
You must take care of yourself
when dealing with Xu Feng.

96
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,620
I can’t afford to lose you.

97
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,600
Li.

98
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,160
Mom.

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,860
Mom.

100
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,800
I have seen you.
Come out.

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
Little boy, what species are you?

102
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,800
I’m a carp elf.

103
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
I don’t believe you.

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
She won’t adopt a real carp.

105
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,160
White loach, who are you?

106
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
I’m another Li.

107
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,040
But we are the same and both of us are false.

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,660
Little loach, are you happy here?

109
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,000
I have plenty to eat and drink

110
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,320
and nice new clothes to wear here.

111
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,940
Surely I’m happy.

112
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,940
But I prefer rolling in the mud puddle.

113
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,380
I can’t let her go on anymore.

114
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,860
I promise to send you back to the mud puddle.

115
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,397
Where is he?

116
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,106
I can’t find him anywhere.

117
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
Was he captured by King of Gu City?

118
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,640
It’s forbidden to get in and out of
the sleeping chamber of His Majesty.

119
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,020
Even if Princess Sui He

120
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,080
wants to borrow something,

121
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,340
you must report it to me first. Got it?

122
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,780
Yes.

123
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,640
I didn’t expect that you are
not only good at martial arts

124
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
but also good at cooking.

125
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,260
Great.

126
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Medical fees.

127
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,980
Claw me and I’ll claw thee.

128
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,620
You saved me, but I was
unable to repay your kindness,

129
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,940
so I cooked a simple meal
to express my gratitude to you.

130
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,120
Here. I don’t need it.

131
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Although you’re my patient,

132
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,140
I’ve regarded you as my friend.

133
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,580
I grew up in Saint Doctors' Family
and seclude myself from the world.

134
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,960
I’m really glad to meet you.

135
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,200
If you heal me,

136
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,400
I’ll achieve one of your dreams someday.

137
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,940
How can a bandit achieve my dream?

138
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,020
Thank you,

139
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,020
but you may not achieve my dream.

140
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,300
If you have a dream,

141
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,060
maybe I can help you achieve it.

142
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,540
That’s a deal.

143
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,340
You don’t stand on ceremony at all.

144
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,020
You get a promise from me then.

145
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
However, I’m sure

146
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,760
we’ll never see each other again in the future.

147
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,940
You bandits lead a bloody life.

148
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,460
Although I don’t have to fight,

149
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,340
I’m on tenterhooks every day.

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,040
In fact, we have the same destination.

151
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,220
I’m just taking one day at a time.

152
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,400
Although I have learned medicine for 15 years

153
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,400
and been proficient in medical science and pharmacology,

154
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,200
you’re actually my first patient.

155
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,080
Isn’t that funny?

156
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,580
As Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,

157
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,580
the meaning of my life

158
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,500
is to prepare Elixir of Life for King Yi.

159
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,500
If I fail,

160
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,040
when King Yi.

161
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
passes away,

162
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,560
it’s also time for me to die.

163
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,560
When King Yi is alive,

164
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,860
I have to decoct herbal medicine for him

165
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,860
and when he dies,

166
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,420
I’ll be buried with his coffin

167
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,360
in the imperial mausoleum as a burial object

168
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,000
to expiate his sins with my holy and pure soul.

169
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,940
But I heard that King Yi

170
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
fights battles everywhere
and has killed many people.

171
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,160
I guess he may die young as well.

172
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,860
So I can’t live for long.

173
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,620
Here.

174
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,120
Crow, I substitute wine with tea
and propose a toast to you.

175
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,180
Thank you

176
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,660
for letting me know

177
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,720
the meaning of being alive

178
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,440
in my humble and insignificant life for the first time.

179
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,540
Although I don’t know
whether you can be cured or not,

180
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,640
you let me know

181
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,580
how wonderful it is to help someone

182
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,980
when I’m still alive.

183
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,320
I have a poor memory.

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,980
I have forgotten that you can’t hear me.

185
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Anyway, Crow,

186
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,720
thank you.

187
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,920
What kind of person are you?

188
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,860
Jin Mi.

189
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,240
I’m afraid that Duke Nanping has plotted for long.

190
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,240
If I return to Palace of King Yi now,
I may be in danger.

191
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,800
It’s better to go to Beiyuan Mountain Villa first.

192
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,020
It is the place where my trusted troops are stationed,

193
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,518
so it is the safest.

194
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,020
I can have a further plan after reaching there.

195
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,000
Crow.

196
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,300
Crow.

197
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Crow.

198
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,980
Crow.

199
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,340
How come

200
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
he vanished like the night drew?

201
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,980
Dear Madam, I’ve been sick
for more than one month

202
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
and thanks to your careful attention,

203
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,256
I was cured yesterday.

204
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:10,674
Something happened in my family,

205
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,400
so I have to leave without saying goodbye.
Please forgive me.

206
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,800
We met by chance,
but anyway we have different paths.

207
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,880
I never make a promise easily,

208
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
but since I do,
I’ll keep it by any means.

209
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,720
Take care of yourself.
Goodbye.

210
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,140
You left the same night as soon as you were cured.

211
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
You didn’t even have time to say goodbye to me

212
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,260
in person?

213
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,540
I won’t charge you for medical fees.

214
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,580
Peony.

215
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
Peony?

216
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,460
Peony.

217
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,020
I’ve planted some carrots.

218
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,440
Would you like some?

219
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,800
Mr. Hu,

220
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
what’s wrong with you today?

221
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,600
Do you think

222
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,280
you live too long

223
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,980
and want to die?

224
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,840
Peony, you do lack a sense of romance.

225
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,760
It’s romantic to die for a beauty.

226
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,620
Moon Immortal really wants to be fertilizer.

227
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,260
Someone,

228
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,940
put him in the rabbit house.

229
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,660
Yes.

230
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,320
No.

231
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,120
No. No.

232
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,100
You…

233
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,220
I won’t go in.
I won’t go in.

234
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,320
Let me out.
Let me out.

235
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,460
Help!

236
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,680
Chief Peony, I was wrong.

237
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,240
Let me out.

238
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
Let me out.

239
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,280
Chief Peony, I was wrong.

240
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,080
Let me out.
Let me out.

241
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,020
Let me out.
Let me out.

242
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Hong Hong.

243
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Don’t cry.

244
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,920
It was all your fault.

245
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
Old fox,

246
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,080
why don’t you make fun of

247
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
those fair children in the heaven

248
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,060
but play tricks on me

249
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,720
in Floral Realm?

250
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,920
Jin Mi and Xu Feng both are absent,

251
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,460
so I’m really bored.

252
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,700
You’re bored, so you played tricks on me?

253
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,320
How dare you offend Chief Peony? Chief…

254
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,000
Chief…

255
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
How dare you make fun of Chief Peony?

256
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,320
You’re so bold. You…

257
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
There is only one man

258
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,840
in Floral Realm.

259
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,160
I could only tie the red rope to you.

260
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,960
Did you just see

261
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,620
how furious those rabbits were?

262
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,460
They came at me.

263
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,160
You know,

264
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,840
a rabbit almost peeled me.

265
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,340
Please let me pass.

266
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,060
A rabbit almost peeled me

267
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,940
just now.

268
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
Fortunately, I have a weapon with me.

269
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
Mr. Hu, you don’t dare to provoke Chief Peony.

270
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,860
How about…

271
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,580
Lian Qiao?

272
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,420
Are, are you kidding me?

273
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,840
I’m a great-great-great-great-grandfather

274
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,200
of the great-great-great-great-grandfather of Lian Qiao.

275
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,480
No way.

276
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,300
Stop kidding.

277
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,140
A usually love story

278
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,860
must be usual

279
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,240
or it won’t be impressive.

280
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,920
Am I right?

281
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,860
You have become dull

282
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,500
because of playing matchmaker all the time.

283
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,180
I’m leaving.

284
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,400
Jin Mi, Xu Feng,

285
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,400
when do you go back after experiencing hardships?

286
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,180
I’m so bored.

287
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Sister, are you worried about Jin Mi?

288
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I wonder how she is going in the mortal world.

289
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,080
Now she has become

290
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
a weak mortal.

291
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Don’t worry.

292
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,160
If she really has an accident

293
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,500
in the mortal world,

294
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,660
she can finish experiencing hardships

295
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,100
and return soon then.

296
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,180
What happens in the mortal world is not terrible,

297
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,080
as it can cultivate her.

298
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,440
I’m afraid that it isn’t mortals who want to harm her.

299
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,900
Jin Mi has no enemy

300
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
except Heavenly Empress.

301
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,820
Heavenly Emperor specially issued a decree

302
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,100
ordering all immortals not to intervene
in Jin Mi’s experiencing hardships.

303
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,780
This is issued for Heavenly Empress, right?

304
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,540
Yes. Take it easy, Sister.

305
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,400
Moreover, Night Immortal

306
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,780
keeps an eye on Jin Mi every day,

307
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
so I think

308
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,660
Jin Mi will return safely

309
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,660
very soon.

310
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,820
She is always a child in my mind.

311
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,720
I was afraid that she might hurt herself,

312
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,240
so I didn’t dare to let go of her in the past.

313
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,720
It’s time to let go of her

314
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,380
and allow her to experience something outside.

315
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,940
Catch me.

316
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,800
Go and catch me.

317
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,440
It’s a serious fault for taking away the Millennial Ginseng.

318
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,380
I don’t know how they will punish me.

319
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,740
Anyway I’m tough. I’ll play it by ear.

320
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,140
Auntie. Qiang Huo.

321
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,240
You’re back.

322
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,940
Jin…

323
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,280
Saint Girl, have you had your dinner?

324
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,740
Are there any leftovers?

325
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,080
Let me cook a bowl of egg noodles for you.

326
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,860
Take it easy.

327
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,520
You’re always reckless.

328
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,320
Did she forget?

329
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,080
Well, give it to me.

330
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,960
Thank you, Auntie.

331
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,600
You have been to Luoye Mountain
for more than one month.

332
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
What did you get?

333
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
I gained a lot.

334
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,500
I will sort it out in a few days

335
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,500
and lecture other girls about it.

336
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,600
How was everything going

337
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
in this month when l left?

338
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,160
Everything was good.

339
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
I feel relieved then.

340
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,700
Jin Mi, I didn’t tell them.

341
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,480
I don’t know

342
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,160
how the elders would punish you

343
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
if I told them.

344
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,160
I thought it over later.

345
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
What you said did make sense.

346
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,640
Anyway King Yi can’t live forever.

347
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,980
It’s better to give it to other people who need it.

348
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I chose you other than ginseng for sure.

349
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,500
How nice you are, Qiang Huo. I know

350
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,500
you’re my best friend.

351
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,340
But you were so bold.

352
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,240
Don’t ever do it again.

353
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,660
I won’t.

354
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,320
Anyway

355
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,940
I don’t have any Millennial Ginseng to steal anymore.

356
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,500
By the way,

357
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,500
was the person you treated with the Millennial Ginseng

358
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,700
cured?

359
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,480
Yes.

360
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,800
But I met

361
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,800
a rare disease

362
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,800
when treating my first patient.

363
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,160
It’s said in the book that
the patient can be cured in three days,

364
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,680
but it took me one whole month.

365
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,920
My biggest impression this time is that

366
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,220
we can’t believe everything in the book.

367
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,880
Experience is the best teacher.

368
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,100
Let’s go.

369
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,080
A country cannot exist without a king.

370
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,240
Xu Feng is missing and may be dead.

371
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,240
We should hold a funeral at once.

372
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
Now Huaiwu is beset by enemies from within and without.

373
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,720
I have no choice.

374
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,880
Cousin must be alive.

375
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
I will look for him in Luoye Mountain with my men.

376
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,820
There are plenty more fish in the sea.

377
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,160
As my daughter,

378
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,320
you can certainly find a good husband.

379
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
Why are you so obsessive

380
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,560
about Xu Feng?

381
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,260
Daddy, you should understand my only dream

382
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,600
is to get married with him in my life.

383
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,500
Even death can’t part me from him.

384
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I don't believe heaven is so cruel

385
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,360
to perish my only dream.

386
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,780
I must find Cousin.

387
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,260
You can’t hold a funeral now.

388
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,780
You…

389
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,260
Your Highness.

390
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,720
Your Highness.
Your Highness.

391
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220
What’s the hurry?

392
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,540
Your Highness,

393
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,540
King Yi returned safely.

394
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,300
What?

395
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,580
King Yi did return safely?

396
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,340
Yes.

397
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,260
Where is he now?

398
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,740
He should have been back to his mansion now.

399
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
Who is that?

400
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,520
Why don’t you show up but hide covertly?

401
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,000
Show up.

402
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,280
Just stay away from her.

403
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,640
Hey, I advise you to mind your own business.

404
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,900
Get rid of him first.

405
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,240
Watch out.

406
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Are you all right?

407
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,280
"Beiyuan Villa"
Your Highness, His Majesty is having a rest.

408
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,800
Let me get in to see him.

409
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,980
His Majesty said

410
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,620
no one is allowed to disturb him without his permission.

411
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,920
How dare you stop me?

412
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,708
Military orders cannot be disobeyed.

413
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,960
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

414
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,480
I won’t leave without seeing him today.

415
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
Qin Tong.

416
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
Yes.

417
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,160
Go to handle her.

418
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,360
Yes.

419
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,360
Get out of my way.

420
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,680
Your Highness, can I have a moment with you?

421
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,620
You’re so reliable.

422
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,820
I’m flattered.

423
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,580
How did you send her away?

424
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,580
Although His Majesty is safe and sound,

425
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,260
but he is exhausted and weak and needs some rest

426
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,520
after a long and tiring journey.

427
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,100
You shouldn’t bother him now.

428
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,220
Please come here tomorrow

429
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,720
and His Majesty will meet you for sure.

430
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,700
How could you make a decision for me?

431
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,500
I was wrong.

432
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,100
The message of my hunting

433
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,380
must have been divulged to Liangguo.

434
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,560
You doubt there is a mole in the palace?

435
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,080
Fine.

436
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,980
Since I need some rest today,

437
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,820
I won’t think about it.

438
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,128
Let’s discuss it tomorrow.

439
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,546
You can leave.

440
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,340
Yes.

441
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,960
Most of the wound has been recovered.

442
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,840
The poison must have worked.

443
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Your Majesty, it’s not a trivial matter

444
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,200
if someone really divulged
the message of your hunting

445
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,540
to Liangguo.

446
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,380
Please allow me to investigate it.

447
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,440
I’ll find the mole as soon as possible.

448
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,620
Thank you, Duke Nanping.

449
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,680
Yes.

450
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,960
Your Majesty, it seems that you’re still weak?

451
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,040
The medical skill of the
imperial doctor isn’t good enough.

452
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,960
How about summoning Saint Girl
of Saint Doctors’ Family here

453
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,720
to examine you?

454
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,220
Saint Girl?

455
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Jin Mi?

456
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,420
She must not be involved.

457
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,280
I feel much better.

458
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,160
You don’t have to go through all this trouble.

459
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,060
Your Majesty, you’re the foundation of Huaiwu.

460
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,060
You can never take it lightly.

461
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,060
Moreover, the mission of Saint Doctors’ Family

462
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,680
is to make sure the good health of you.

463
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,920
It’s proper

464
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,400
to summon Saint Girl here now.

465
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,280
Your Majesty, I think what
Duke Nanping said makes sense.

466
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,500
I hope

467
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,240
Your Majesty can summon
the Saint Girl here as soon as possible

468
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,280
to nurse your health.

469
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,760
I also agree.

470
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,360
Duke Nanping acts quickly.

471
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,720
He asked me for the imperial edict

472
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
and sent for Saint Girl

473
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,480
shortly after he advised to summon her.

474
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,580
Qin Tong, pick several of your trusted subordinates

475
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,580
to follow the men of Duck Nanping

476
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,260
and make sure the safety of Saint Girl.

477
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,260
I’ll protect Saint Girl?

478
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,100
I won’t feel relieved if you don’t go there in person.

479
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,820
I’m worried that

480
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,660
someone really wants to kill you.

481
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,060
Don’t worry.
I have a plan.

482
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,220
I’ll get prepared now.

483
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,860
Cousin, are you getting better?

484
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,120
Much better.

485
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,440
Yesterday I heard from Qin Tong that

486
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,860
you were still weak,

487
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,320
so I asked the senior pharmacist
in my mansion for advice

488
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,660
and chose the best materials

489
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,240
to stew a cup of decoction in person.

490
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,160
It can alleviate your weakness and tiredness

491
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Thank you.

492
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,100
You know,

493
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,500
I worried much about you recently.

494
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,500
Leave the decoction.

495
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,980
I’m tired after discussing
official business in the court today.

496
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,020
I’m going to take a rest.

497
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,860
Someone, keep the decoction.

498
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,680
But…

499
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,680
When will you look back at

500
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,140
my love for you?

501
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,820
Taste some grapes for me.

502
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,140
It looks sweet.

503
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,580
So sour.

504
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,340
Liar.
You such a liar.

505
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,860
"Saint Girl Hall"
Hurry up.

506
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,360
"Saint Girl Hall"
What’s going on?

507
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,140
"Saint Girl Hall"
Look. Have a look. What’s going on?

508
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,620
"Saint Girl Hall"
What happened?

509
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,580
I don’t know.

510
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,880
What happened?

511
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,720
It isn’t the day to hold a memorial ceremony today.

512
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,140
Auntie looks serious.

513
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,220
I said nothing.

514
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,340
Did Auntie know

515
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,020
we flew a kite secretly yesterday?

516
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,620
I don’t know either.

517
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,360
Saint Girl, do you why we come to Saint Girl Hall?

518
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,140
I’m stupid. Please instruct me, Auntie.

519
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,820
Tell me where the ginseng is.

520
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,040
How come the ginseng is gone?

521
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,780
If people from the capital didn’t ask me about it,

522
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,440
the elders and I

523
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,320
wouldn’t check the pharmacy

524
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,360
and we wouldn’t find

525
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,280
the ginseng is gone.

526
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,260
The ginseng is kept by you.

527
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,500
How come it’s gone?

528
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,080
Well, er.

529
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,260
Oh, no.

530
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,180
I didn’t expect that I was caught so soon.

531
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,020
Saint Girl, where is the ginseng?

532
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,080
Auntie, Longevity Qiankun Elixir is prepared.

533
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
What?

534
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
But,

535
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,560
but I took it.

536
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,920
I was afraid that any mistake was made,

537
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,980
so I took it for King Yi

538
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
to have a test.

539
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,240
How, how could you

540
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,700
take such an important thing?

541
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,320
Auntie, I took the liberty to take it

542
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
without discussing with you and the elders

543
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,120
in advance. Please punish me.

544
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,400
Didn’t you know the ginseng
can’t be found within 1,000 years?

545
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Since you weren’t totally sure,

546
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,940
how could you add the guiding drug easily?

547
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,820
Auntie, I was not very well the day before yesterday

548
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,820
and arbitrarily took away the medicine of Saint Girl.

549
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,060
I thought it was common medicine

550
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,060
and didn’t expect it is Longevity Qiankun Elixir.

551
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,160
You…

552
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,004
No, Auntie.

553
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,005
It has nothing to do with Qiang Huo.

554
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,360
She wanted to bear the blame for me.

555
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,100
It was done by me alone.

556
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,820
I’m willing to take the consequences.

557
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,840
No. It’s my fault.

558
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,380
No, Auntie.

559
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,960
It’s my fault. It’s my fault. It isn’t Qiang Huo’s fault.

560
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,940
You don’t have to protect me.

561
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,920
Auntie, it’s my fault.

562
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,200
Saint Girl. Auntie.

563
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,220
King Yi issued an imperial edict summoning Saint Girl.
