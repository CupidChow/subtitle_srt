"Episode 37"

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,440
"Qizheng Hall"

4
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,450
According to Her Majesty’s instructions,

5
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,020
Your Highness,

6
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,060
when you’re in mourning,

7
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,540
you can stay in Xuanji Palace

8
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,380
and don’t need to go out
to be on night duty for star arrangement.

9
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,714
Yes.

10
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,085
Her Majesty shows solicitude for you.

11
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:31,942
so we’re specially ordered

12
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,000
to send you two kinds of different mourning dresses

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,142
for selection.

14
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,200
Put them down.

15
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:40,742
Her Majesty said,

16
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,342
you can decide

17
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,971
to choose the one of Heaven Realm
or that of Arowana Family,

18
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,028
and then we need to take the other one back.

19
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:51,220
According to the custom of the Arowana Family,

20
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,571
I should wear the funeral raw jute clothing
to observe mourning for my mother.

21
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:57,142
Her Majesty loves you dearly.

22
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,228
The raw jute cloth is rough.

23
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,457
You’re delicate, so you can’t bear it.

24
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:03,257
The funeral linen clothing of
Heaven Realm is more suitable.

25
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,771
You’re supposed to resist against

26
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,400
the Heavenly Empress and the Bird Family afterwards.

27
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:35,600
We have to go back to report to Her Majesty.

28
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:37,371
We take our leave.

29
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:55,428
Is it a mourning rule in the Heaven Realm

30
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:57,657
to throw away the funeral clothing?

31
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,171
Why is the first Prince angry?

32
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,828
As ruled in the Heaven Realm,

33
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,000
one has to wear the funeral linen clothing
when observing mourning,

34
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,057
but in our family,

35
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:10,000
the funeral raw jute clothing should be worn.

36
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,771
So he made a wrong choice?

37
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,742
I’m useless.

38
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,885
Don’t blame yourself.

39
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,085
Keep filial piety in your heart.

40
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:26,800
Your mother knew that.

41
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,700
It’s very hard for you to observe mourning for her

42
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,314
under the great pressure from
Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress.

43
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:35,542
I believe she would smile in the underworld.

44
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,742
It’s far from enough.

45
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:40,685
I won’t settle down

46
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,314
if I don’t avenge my mother.

47
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:46,380
Why not leave everything behind

48
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,860
and go away with me and Li?

49
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,714
Now,

50
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,380
I’m afraid

51
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,771
it’s an extravagant hope
to be as unworldly as wild stock.

52
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,600
What’s your plan in the future?

53
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,371
No haste, be patient.

54
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,571
Your mother once asked me

55
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:18,228
to give it to you

56
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,628
if the situation changed.

57
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:22,742
What’s in it?

58
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,514
I have never opened it.

59
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:26,457
Check it yourself.

Force Deployment Map
of the Bird Family on Yimiao Continent

61
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,628
Your Majesty,

62
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:57,428
the first Prince chose the funeral linen clothing.

63
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:00,914
You can leave.

64
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:02,057
Yes.

65
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:06,114
Auntie, you’re a genius.

66
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,257
You sound Night Immortal out
with the funeral clothing.

67
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:10,857
Now you know whether
he follows the Heaven Realm

68
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,685
or the Arowana Family.

69
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,428
He is smart,

70
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,457
loyal and sensible.

71
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:20,114
Don’t underestimate him.

72
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:22,171
When he was young,

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
he scaled himself cruelly

74
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,285
and dared to take the Fumeng Elixir I gave him.

75
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:32,514
He was devastated

76
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,285
when Su Li died.

77
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
I’m sure that he won’t leave the matter at that.

78
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:38,914
But

79
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,200
he is His Majesty’s son.

80
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:44,742
I won’t go too far.

81
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:46,171
I just sounded him out

82
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:48,800
as a warning.

83
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,028
Auntie, you’re circumspect and farsighted.

84
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:52,800
I must learn from you more.

85
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:59,828
It’s the birthday of Moon Immortal today.

86
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,114
Send my gift to him.

87
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:03,828
Yes.

88
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,540
"House of Marriage"

89
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:21,600
Mister Immortal,

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,257
we come to celebrate your birthday.

91
00:07:23,828 --> 00:07:26,628
May your fortune
be as boundless as the East Sea.

92
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:29,200
May you live a long life
as the pine tree in the Southern Mountain.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,828
The same congratulations.

94
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,771
Are you blind?

95
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,342
I’m young

96
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:37,714
with delicate features.

97
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,628
Don’t compare me to the wrinkled old pine tree

98
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,942
in the Southern Mountain.

99
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:43,028
Yes.

100
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:49,542
What’s this?

101
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,457
His Highness is still grounded

102
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:55,028
to reflect on his misdeeds in palace today,

103
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:57,714
so he ordered us to present the birthday gift.

104
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:58,914
You gave an irrelevant answer.

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,885
I asked you what it was,

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,485
but you talked rubbish.

107
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:02,685
Forget it. You can leave.

108
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,571
Mister Immortal, we're leaving.

109
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:19,714
It’s a brilliant idea

110
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,485
to collect those treasures.

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,571
I’m flattered.

112
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,342
It’s to cater to Moon Immortal’s pleasure.

113
00:08:24,857 --> 00:08:26,460
Thy are the most fashionable story-telling scripts

114
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,314
in the Human Realm.

115
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,800
Moon Immortal

116
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:30,742
must be happy.

117
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,057
I don’t praise you.

118
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,857
It seems you ignored your
proper occupation in mortal world,

119
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:38,285
and always ran irrelevant business
with your fellows.

120
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,171
If you didn’t hinder me,

121
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,114
I

122
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,628
I would have pacified the world

123
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,114
and created a flourishing age in mortal world.

124
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:49,885
Sorry.

125
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,142
But

126
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:52,685
you indeed become smarter

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,028
after the experience in mortal world.

128
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,142
I’m praising you.

129
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:19,028
Mister Immortal.

130
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,657
Jin Mi,

131
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:23,371
here you are.

132
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,657
Mister Immortal, you make a mistake again.

133
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:26,571
I’m not Fairy Jin Mi.

134
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,857
Kuang Lu.

135
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:30,628
What’s up?

136
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,485
Why do you get a nosebleed?

137
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,285
I get inflamed.

138
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,257
Come.

139
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,114
Xu Feng

140
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,457
sent a box of pornographic scripts.

141
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,657
They’re new.

142
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:44,114
Let’s read them together.

143
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:45,028
Well,

144
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,371
I come to you for something else.

145
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,000
His Highness can’t go out
as he is observing mourning for his mother,

146
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:52,514
so he ordered me to come
to celebrate your birthday.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
May you be young forever.

148
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,514
You’re clever.

149
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:07,142
It’s a good thing.

150
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:09,428
It’s shining.

151
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:10,742
With it,

152
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:11,771
I can read the scripts

153
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,457
Xu Feng sent at night.

154
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,171
Wonderful.

155
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:19,600
Run Yu is poor.

156
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,228
Give him my thanks

157
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,885
and consolations.

158
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,885
I will.

159
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,142
Thank you, Mister Immortal.

160
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:28,514
Well,

161
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,514
Run Yu can’t attend my birthday banquet.

162
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:31,771
Kuang Lu, come.

163
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,600
Let’s drink and enjoy ourselves.

164
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,457
I’m a low-level fairy.

165
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,000
I’m afraid…

166
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:40,857
Water Immortal will bring Jin Mi.

167
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,857
Ask your father to bring you.

168
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:44,514
Or,

169
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:47,714
I’ll be lonely at the banquet.

170
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,257
I’m unhappy.

171
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,085
Then I’ll come.

172
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:52,914
Thank you, Mister Immortal.

173
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:55,257
Good girl.

174
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:57,200
I’m taking my leave now.

175
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.

176
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:13,657
Wind Immortal, Water Immortal,

177
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,057
Immortal Jin Mi come.

178
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:17,942
Amazing.

179
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Water Immortal.

180
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,342
Jin Mi.

181
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,314
Come on.

182
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,542
Help yourselves.

183
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:26,857
Don’t stand on ceremony. Come on.

184
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,140
Make yourselves at home.

185
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,060
Eat whatever you like.

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,428
Do you know what my gift is?

187
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:34,400
What is it?

188
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Something from the mortal world.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,085
Try it.

190
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,914
So clear!

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,180
I can see things more clearly.

192
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:45,580
Do you like it?

193
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:46,620
Wonderful.

194
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,685
With this treasure,

195
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:51,142
I can read 100 scripts in a day.

196
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:55,200
Jin Mi,

197
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:59,828
it turns out that you’re
more beautiful than what I imagined.

198
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,057
Princess Sui He comes.

199
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:04,114
Fairy Yuan Ji comes.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,742
Mister Immortal,

201
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,000
I come on behalf of Her Majesty.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,028
Okay. Good girl, help yourself.

203
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,371
Yuan Ji. Yuan Ji.

204
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,971
Good girl. I don’t want to eat it.

205
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,342
Yuan Ji,

206
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,714
you’re so stingy.

207
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,571
You come without bringing a gift.

208
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:40,628
I was thinking

209
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,285
how to continue the
second life of the white snake

210
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:45,257
after the collapse of
Leifeng Pagoda these days.

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,971
I wanted to

212
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:49,085
make her a fruit elf in the Floral Realm,

213
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:52,857
and you could decide
her destiny and marriage.

214
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,628
But it seems that

215
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,228
you don’t like my gift.

216
00:12:58,742 --> 00:12:59,428
Yuan Ji,

217
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,285
I know you care about me.

218
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:03,257
It’s

219
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,714
an excellent gift.

220
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:07,257
Go. Let’s drink.

221
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:07,885
Go.

222
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,342
Eat it.

223
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,685
Thank you, Daddy.

224
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,114
I still think it’s unusual.

225
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:19,771
I feel the same way.

226
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,314
Jin Mi.

227
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,942
It has to be talked about at length.

228
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:26,742
By then…

229
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:27,314
Daddy.

230
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:30,450
Go.

231
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,571
Besides me,

232
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,514
do you like Xu Feng?

233
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes.

234
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,571
How about Moon Immortal?

235
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:57,942
Yes.

236
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,371
And Lord Yan You?

237
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,028
Yes.

238
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,942
If Jin Mi is a piece of barren land,

239
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,742
no matter what seed is sowed
and what fertilizer is applied,

240
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,628
no matter how you water it
with the utmost care,

241
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:11,085
it won’t blossom in return.

242
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:13,942
Falling in love with her
is like a stone dropped into the sea.

243
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,085
There will be no respond from her.

244
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:16,685
It takes time and energy.

245
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,342
Are you afraid?

246
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,514
Jin Mi is essentially a good girl,

247
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:24,171
but she is cold and heartless from childhood.

248
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
She doesn’t like anyone,

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,114
not to mention love.

250
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:34,742
She used to be cold,

251
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:37,714
passionate but ruthless.

252
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,628
Now she is heartless but single-minded.

253
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:43,028
Why does she

254
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,000
change so dramatically?

255
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,400
I took Floating Dream Pill before,

256
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,171
so I forgot my mother and childhood memory.

257
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:57,885
Is Mi controlled?

258
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:03,657
Mi,

259
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,714
which one is the real you?

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,428
Yun Elixir?

261
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,514
His Majesty comes.

262
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:28,742
Your Majesty, welcome.

263
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:30,228
Your Majesty, welcome.

264
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,485
Your Majesty, welcome.

265
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:32,971
Don’t stand on ceremony.

266
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:35,085
It’s the birthday banquet
of Moon Immortal today.

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,514
Make yourselves at home.

268
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,628
Your Majesty, you have to
deal with a host of problems every day.

269
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,200
Why brings you here today?

270
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Moon Immortal, do you blame me
for coming without being invited

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
or complain I haven’t come for long?

272
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,114
Not at all.

273
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,342
My humble house is honored by your presence.

274
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,028
Our family members have come.

275
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,400
There are not many people,

276
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,542
so it’s sort of deserted.

277
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,314
My Eight Characters are unlucky.

278
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:01,200
During my birthday banquet,

279
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,971
the first Prince is observing
mourning for his mother,

280
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,342
while the second Prince is grounded...

281
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,342
You want me to release them?

282
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,657
Forget them.

283
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:12,057
Let’s enjoy ourselves.

284
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,085
Immortal Tai Si is here.

285
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,885
You know many novel poems.

286
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:20,457
It's a good idea to take it as an entertainment.

287
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay. Your Majesty,

288
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:26,114
I learned a poem in mortal world recently.

289
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,740
I’ll entertain

290
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,400
you and everyone here.

291
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:33,314
Please.

292
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:34,057
Let’s enjoy it.

293
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,314
Don’t you see Lord Xu’s two sons
who were born utterly remarkable?

294
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,657
The duo came one after another
following an auspicious dream.

295
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:52,171
Confucius and the Buddha
personally brought them in their arms.

296
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:54,685
Both are from the heaven, unicorn foals.

297
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:57,314
The elder is nine years old,
he is clever and pure.

298
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,771
Autumn waters are his soul,
jade is his bones.

299
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:02,514
The younger son is five years old,
exhibiting an imposing presence.

300
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:05,028
The guests that fill the hall
all turn their heads.

301
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:07,542
I know that Lord Xu has no worries at all.

302
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:11,085
A continuous flood of accumulated virtue
produces these dukes or counts.

303
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:14,971
When a man have sons like these two chicks,

304
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:18,571
how could his fame and position
end up small or low?

305
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:20,228
Wonderful.

306
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:24,342
Your Majesty,

307
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:27,771
when I first heard this poem in Human Realm,

308
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,857
the heroic bearing of you and your sons

309
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,514
occurred to me.

310
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,171
This poem

311
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:35,828
is presented to you.

312
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:38,342
Lickspittle.

313
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:39,257
Lower your voice.

314
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:41,428
Only you can hear me.

315
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,028
Everyone present can practice this skill.

316
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,285
What if someone intercepts it halfway?

317
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,142
Dan Zhu.

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,485
What’re you two talking about?

319
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,285
The game "Pass the parcel".

320
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:52,400
Anyone want to play?

321
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,820
Time flies.

322
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,057
We have become old,

323
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:08,571
and our children have grown up

324
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,914
and will get married.

325
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:12,857
It’s a good thing.

326
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,685
Pitifully, Floral Immortal can’t witness it.

327
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:22,057
She is dead, but I miss her very much.

328
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:25,828
Your Majesty, you have deep love,
strive after virtue, practice good deeds

329
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:27,085
and protect all living creatures.

330
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:30,514
Your sons are noble and dignified.

331
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:33,714
It’s really your virtue and
the blessing of the Heaven Realm.

332
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:37,600
You’re also a lickspittle.

333
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,685
I flatter His Majesty.

334
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,028
Then others can’t do that.

335
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,857
My sons have grown up,

336
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,971
but they worry me.

337
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:51,714
Water Immortal and Immortal Tai Si

338
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,100
is blessed with thoughtful daughters.

339
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,628
Kuang Lu, stand up.

340
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,685
Come on. Stand up.

341
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,000
Come on.

342
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:02,000
Come on.

343
00:19:03,885 --> 00:19:04,628
Your Majesty,

344
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:08,514
I have one daughter only.

345
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,371
Kuang Lu, greet His Majesty.

346
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,428
Your Majesty.

347
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:16,628
Stand up.

348
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,200
You indeed look like dew,

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,342
clear, crystal, slim and graceful.

350
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,657
Are you of the same age with Jin Mi and Sui He?

351
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,371
Your Majesty,

352
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,342
may I make bold to ask you for a favor?

353
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,028
My daughter is too honest

354
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,400
and docile.

355
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,114
Your Majesty,

356
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,742
please betroth

357
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:45,085
her to a good husband.

358
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,857
Unexpectedly, he would request this.

359
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,828
His Majesty shows solicitude
for the weak and the old.

360
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:54,057
Then he cottons up to
His Majesty with his daughter.

361
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,885
I give in.

362
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:00,742
The first Prince has been engaged with Jin Mi.

363
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,342
It seems that

364
00:20:02,342 --> 00:20:04,857
he is eager to betroth his daughter
to the second Prince.

365
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,142
It turns out that he has other purposes.

366
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:08,171
Daddy.

367
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:10,514
I’m not drunk.

368
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,514
My father is drunk.

369
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,085
Your Majesty, please forgive him
for forgetting himself in his cups.

370
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:17,828
Taisi,

371
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:20,171
you’re indeed drunk.

372
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,285
You should turn to me for your daughter’s marriage.

373
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,342
Why do you turn to His Majesty?

374
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,114
You’re not responsible for
the marriages of the Heaven Realm.

375
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,257
Why should we turn to you?

376
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,914
Parents’ love can’t be punished.

377
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:34,342
We drink and talk today.

378
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,228
You can say everything.

379
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,542
Daddy.

380
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,800
Daddy, you’re drunk.

381
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,885
I’m not.

382
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,628
Their fathers have great magic power.

383
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:46,800
They love each other dearly.

384
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,714
Daddy, eat it.

385
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,971
Daddy, you were the most handsome
in Huaiwu when you were young.

386
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:57,714
You’re always the best father in this world

387
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,000
in my mind.

388
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,685
You have an imposing and graceful appearance.

389
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,628
You’re clever and nice.

390
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,657
I’m jealous of

391
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,400
the lucky man

392
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:12,800
who marries you.

393
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:27,371
But it is a pity that compared with Xu Feng,

394
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,028
you’re nothing

395
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,257
but a mere mortal.

396
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,428
I don't feel quite myself.

397
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:50,571
I have to leave.

398
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:57,771
Sui,

399
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,114
why are you

400
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:01,714
so obsessive with someone

401
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:03,771
who doesn’t love you?

402
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:06,000
If he really cared about you,

403
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,000
he would have married you.

404
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,428
I killed my father.

405
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:16,114
I killed the only person who treated me sincerely

406
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:18,342
and loved me the most dearly,

407
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:22,228
but Xu Feng still doesn’t love me.

408
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:31,371
Xu Feng,

409
00:22:34,057 --> 00:22:35,085
I hate you.

410
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,285
Jin Mi,

411
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,114
I hate you.

412
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:56,571
You’re back.

413
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:00,571
Does Moon Immortal like the green screen
with the patter of mist and clouds?

414
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,742
You

415
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:05,771
should go to visit him more frequently.

416
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:06,685
You know?

417
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:12,971
You can leave.

418
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,000
OK.

419
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
Auntie,

420
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,257
in both the Heaven Realm and the Human Realm,

421
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:29,714
everyone likes

422
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,285
Jin Mi.

423
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,942
I can’t defeat her, right?

424
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,257
The second Prince will never love me, right?

425
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,914
Shut up.

426
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:46,914
You’re in low spirits.

427
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:50,057
How can you lead the Bird Family?

428
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:52,342
What can I do?

429
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:56,057
Even if I die,

430
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,028
the second Prince won’t care about it.

431
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:03,828
Stand up.

432
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,114
Listen carefully.

433
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:09,771
The Bird Family is noble.

434
00:24:11,028 --> 00:24:12,800
We must be strong.

435
00:24:13,314 --> 00:24:14,628
Your sufferings

436
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:16,857
will pay off.

437
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:21,200
It’s not the last moment yet.

438
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,057
The winner remains unknown,

439
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,428
right?

440
00:24:30,514 --> 00:24:31,714
There, there.

441
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,028
Don’t cry.

442
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:43,542
I heard of your mother’s death.

443
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,800
I’m overwhelmed with indignation.

444
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:46,685
Please restrain your grief.

445
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,828
I share the same enemy and hatred with Jin Mi.

446
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:56,400
Chief Peony,

447
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,342
something confuses me.

448
00:24:58,514 --> 00:25:00,171
Please enlighten me.

449
00:25:00,857 --> 00:25:02,114
Go ahead.

450
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:07,257
Mi is different from the ordinary people in love.

451
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,971
Why did you say that?

452
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,971
I remember that you once said

453
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:18,000
Jin Mi is a rarely heartless girl in this world,

454
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,685
but it’s a painful topic.

455
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,428
When I read in Xingjing Court,

456
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:28,685
I accidentally found that
it might be related to Yun Elixir.

457
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,428
It’s good that she lives

458
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,971
a happy and carefree life,

459
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:43,142
but according to my original intention,

460
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:46,685
I am more willing to help her take out Yun Elixir.

461
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,571
No one should deprive her of the right to love.

462
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,657
If so,

463
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:56,514
are you confident to protect Jin Mi?

464
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,628
It’s predicted that Jin Mi will
have a love problem in 10,000 years.

465
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:04,285
If the elixir is taken out, how to protect her?

466
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:06,971
Did you tell the truth of Yun Elixir

467
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,000
to Jin Mi?

468
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:11,085
No.

469
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,371
If she knows the truth,

470
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,200
I don’t know what the consequences will be.

471
00:26:16,571 --> 00:26:18,057
Don’t worry.

472
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:19,714
As I said,

473
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,257
I must protect her

474
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:23,142
anyway.

475
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:34,857
Sorry for

476
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:37,028
what happened that night.

477
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,714
We’re accomplices.

478
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:44,457
I am also responsible.

479
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:47,714
You’re now my man.

480
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,540
Don’t worry.

481
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,020
I’ll be responsible for you.

482
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,171
You look like a gangster.

483
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,542
Don’t you know

484
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,542
the man I loved in the previous life

485
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,314
was a bandit named Crow?

486
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,142
I was his wife.

487
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,314
Then you’ll be Fire Immortal’s wife afterwards.

488
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:10,000
I have told my father about it.

489
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,371
What did he say?

490
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:15,142
He didn’t say no,

491
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:17,371
but some things worried him.

492
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,542
He asked me to think over.

493
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:25,485
I know what his worries are.

494
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,285
Don’t worry.

495
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,542
I’ll solve them as soon as possible.

496
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,342
I made this

497
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,057
for you.

498
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,542
What’s it?

499
00:27:39,371 --> 00:27:40,971
You’re stupid.

500
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,371
It’s Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits.

501
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:46,514
Place it in your heart

502
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:48,228
and activate it with magic power.

503
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,371
Then you can get the beautiful scenery
with spring flowers and autumn fruits.

504
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,620
It’s spring in the morning and autumn in the evening.

505
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,660
It can last one day.

506
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:57,600
Do you know where the beautiful scenery comes?

507
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,742
Where?

508
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,742
Let me tell you secretly.

509
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,000
It’s stolen from the Floral Realm.

510
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,742
Chief Peony must be startled by then.

511
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:08,342
I can’t eat it or fight with it.

512
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,885
It’s useless.

513
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,228
You’re right.

514
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,257
Fine.

515
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:18,057
I’ll take it back and turn it into a weapon.

516
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:22,628
Why are there spring flowers and autumn fruits only?

517
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:23,942
I also want

518
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,257
your summer heat and winter snow.

519
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:29,600
It’s not necessary.

520
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:31,600
You’re Fire Immortal,

521
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,428
so you have summer heat.

522
00:28:33,942 --> 00:28:36,800
And I have winter snow.

523
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:39,542
Then there are four seasons.

524
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,342
When does my stupid girl

525
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,171
become so clever?

526
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:42,857
Well,

527
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,628
I’ll place it in my soul

528
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,228
and protect it.

529
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,342
I have...

530
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:01,657
I have to go.

531
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,380
"Xuanji Palace"

532
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:18,000
Are you waiting for me here?

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,257
Where are you going?

534
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:21,885
Slow down.

535
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,257
Slow down.

536
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:28,171
Slow down.

537
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:40,571
Well, I know.

538
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:41,542
I’ll go in.

539
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:50,914
Fish Fairy.

540
00:31:07,714 --> 00:31:09,885
Fish Fairy, what happened?

541
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,942
When I was young,

542
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:14,000
I always felt myself inferior

543
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,885
as I had a strange shape

544
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:20,628
and pale color in Taihu Lake.

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,257
At that time,

546
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,142
to become a cryprinus carpiod,

547
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,657
I practiced without a stop

548
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:29,714
every day.

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,914
I didn’t know until I came here that

550
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:38,285
I was doing something useless

551
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:40,742
in the past

552
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,171
thousands of years.

553
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:45,257
In fact, I am not a cryprinus carpiod,

554
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:49,714
but a white loong which wanted to become a fish.

555
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,600
Recalling it now,

556
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,685
I was like a frog at the bottom of a well at the time.

557
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:06,114
Look at me.

558
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:10,285
I used to be a plebeian fruit fairy for 4,000 years.

559
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,285
Originally, I thought

560
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:13,885
I was a fruit fairy,

561
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:15,371
but unexpectedly,

562
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:18,114
I’m a frost flower made from water.

563
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:20,114
So we’re

564
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,085
the same.

565
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:23,085
In fact,

566
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:26,457
it’s happy to be

567
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:28,742
a frog at the bottom of a well.

568
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,657
Sometimes

569
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,228
the more I know,

570
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:37,085
the more pain I suffer.

571
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,371
Fish Fairy,

572
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,771
are you missing your mother?

573
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:45,257
The broad-leaved epiphyllum
blossomed the night before last,

574
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:47,828
but you were absent.

575
00:32:50,514 --> 00:32:51,828
No one appreciated the blossom

576
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,514
or smelled its fragrance.

577
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,657
It may be

578
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,771
the saddest thing for a flower.

579
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,514
You’re wrong.

580
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,228
I gave it to you,

581
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,028
so you’re its owner.

582
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,800
Since you were here,

583
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,600
it didn’t blossom in vain.

584
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,142
I’m really its owner?

585
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,485
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

586
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:03,142
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

587
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:06,114
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

588
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:09,428
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

589
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,085
<i>I hope to wash away the vanity,</i>

590
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,257
<i>wipe the dust on me</i>

591
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:20,285
<i>and get drunk with you again</i>

592
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:24,342
<i>with a pot of clear wine.</i>

593
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,228
For thousands of years,

594
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,485
I just showed my real body twice,

595
00:34:30,342 --> 00:34:32,285
but you witnessed it.

596
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:33,885
Don’t laugh at me.

597
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:44,571
I don’t want much in this life.

598
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,771
Love me a little bit more every day.

599
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:51,314
Day after day,

600
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:53,714
month after month

601
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,371
and year after year.

602
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,140
I don’t care even if you love me just a little bit.

603
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,571
I hope your love lasts forever.

604
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:09,257
Will you?

605
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:14,571
It’s late at night.

606
00:35:14,971 --> 00:35:16,114
I have to go back.

607
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,628
It really cracks.

608
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:24,400
Mi,

609
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,971
you treat Xu Feng without reservation.

610
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:32,571
You know what,

611
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,514
when I saw the dream
shown by the Beast of Dreams

612
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:40,342
and you kissed each other,

613
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,914
do you know how sad I was?

614
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,828
I wish

615
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:14,285
you didn’t know what love was,

616
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:17,771
wouldn’t fall in love,

617
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,742
couldn’t love anyone

618
00:37:21,828 --> 00:37:23,657
or be in love.

619
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:10,628
I have nothing left.

620
00:38:13,714 --> 00:38:14,914
I only have you.

621
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,914
Don’t leave me,

622
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:20,742
okay?

623
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,314
Frost Flower, why do you ignore me?

624
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,942
Don’t you want to go out?

625
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,085
Liu Ying

626
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:37,142
Jin Mi, please do me a favor.
