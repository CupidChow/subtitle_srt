1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 46"

3
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,060
As expected, you attached my hair

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,680
to the essence of Internal Dan.

5
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,020
What is love?

6
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,700
The elder is nine years old, he is clever and pure.

7
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,360
Autumn waters are his soul, jade is his bones.

8
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,020
The younger son is five years old,
exhibiting an imposing presence.

9
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,860
The guests that fill the hall all turn their heads.

10
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,980
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

11
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,580
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

12
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,691
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>

13
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,361
<i>Time can’t go back...</i>

14
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,520
A bird with black feathers

15
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,900
isn’t always crow or magpie.

16
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,580
It may be an adust phoenix.

17
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,520
Do you want to change your life?

18
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,400
For example,

19
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,080
for example, be an ordinary girl,

20
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,080
or,

21
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
or, be my wife.

22
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,320
I’ll leave my only Phoenix Hairpin to you.

23
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,380
Don’t you know my mind?

24
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,720
Do you know that

25
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,380
the one destroying others’ marriage
will go to the hell?

26
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
Don’t you fear that?

27
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,311
I’m an immortal.

28
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:21,271
I’m not afraid of going to the hell.

29
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,620
I’m afraid of nothing

30
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,880
in heaven and earth.

31
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,480
The only thing I’m afraid of

32
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,160
is your mind.

33
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
Now,

34
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,420
you finally become my ugly wife.

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,120
Phoenix!

36
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,160
Run Yu,

37
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,500
what a good boy you’re!

38
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,720
Xu Feng.

39
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,280
Tai Wei.

40
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,700
Tai Wei!

41
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,382
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>

42
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:38,136
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

43
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,723
<i>The memory haunts me, </i>

44
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:45,810
<i>making me grieved.</i>

45
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,771
<i>Hope I won’t feel regret in the rest of my life. </i>

46
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:53,025
<i>Fly away with the fragrance of the flowers.</i>

47
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,778
<i>A pot of clear wine </i>

48
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,947
<i>and the dust on me...</i>

49
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,720
Your Majesty.

50
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,460
Xu Feng.

51
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,840
Save him.

52
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,680
Your Majesty.

53
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,140
You don’t have to do this.

54
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,720
Mi.

55
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,407
l can’t lose him.

56
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:44,533
Let me go.

57
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
Let me go!

58
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,900
Why?

59
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,400
Why did you kill him?

60
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,680
I love him dearly,

61
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,780
but you killed him.

62
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,660
Why?

63
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,540
Why?

64
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,234
<i>A pot of clear wine </i>

65
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,403
<i>and the dust on me.</i>

66
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,740
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

67
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:39,220
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

68
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,300
<i>I look back and taste the
aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

69
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,940
<i>I know clearly all these births and deaths in my memory...</i>

70
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,520
Your Majesty,

71
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,420
Water Immortal has been sleeping for half a year.

72
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,560
We can’t wake her up no matter how hard we try.

73
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,020
Would she

74
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,500
remain unconscious forever?

75
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,800
No.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,380
She’ll recover her consciousness.

77
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,220
She’ll come back to me.

78
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,540
Your Majesty, I’ve chosen 108 heaven generals

79
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,980
from millions of heaven troops

80
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,240
to guard outside the palace.

81
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,735
However, the Palace General is very important,

82
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,360
you should decide it personally.

83
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,280
What do you think about Po Jun?

84
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,240
Po Jun?

85
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,540
Your Majesty, he was promoted

86
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,480
by Fire Immortal personally.

87
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,917
Palace General will rule 30,000 immortals

88
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:06,627
to guard you closely, Your Majesty.

89
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,940
It’ll be impossible to defend effectively

90
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,580
if he becomes disloyal.

91
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,280
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

92
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
Po Jun is loyal and honest.

93
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
If he agrees, he won’t be disloyal.

94
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,680
If he is disloyal, he won’t agree.

95
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,260
Your Majesty, you’re tolerant,

96
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
-but...
-Half a year ago,

97
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,980
Heaven Realm was severely damaged in chaos.

98
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,420
Now as a thousand things wait to be done,

99
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,980
we need more talents.

100
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,180
I want to tell immortals and six realms

101
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,460
that everything takes on a completely
new look in Heaven Realm.

102
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,980
Now I’ll use virtuous and talented
people regardless of their past.

103
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,280
What matters is that everyone knows this,

104
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,780
not

105
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,200
the agreement of Po Jun.

106
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,096
Your Majesty,

107
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:03,890
you are considerate to the people, wise and brilliant.

108
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,060
I’ll deal with it now.

109
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,067
It changes in a flash and the scenery is beautiful.

110
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:16,569
Under the colorful cloud is a grand pavilion.

111
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,060
In the breeze and drizzle, the boat is covered by mist.

112
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
The girl in her private room
hasn’t realized how valuable time is.

113
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,420
Wei.

114
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,940
Wei.

115
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,660
Go to tell His Majesty that Water Immortal

116
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
has recovered her consciousness.

117
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,380
Hurry up.

118
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,580
Immortal, please wait.

119
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,080
The grand enthronement of
His Majesty ended just now.

120
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,360
He is drinking with immortals happily.

121
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,120
His Majesty was anxious for you

122
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,960
when you remained unconscious
in the past half a year.

123
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,800
I remained unconscious for half a year?

124
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
You mentioned Water Immortal just now.

125
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,120
Is my dad also here?

126
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
You’re

127
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,940
Water Immortal now.

128
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Do you forget it?

129
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,920
Yes, my dad has gone.

130
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
This isn’t a dream.

131
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,780
Well,

132
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,420
Fire Immortal.

133
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
How about Fire Immortal?

134
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,440
Fire Immortal?

135
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,120
Now,

136
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,800
there isn’t Fire Immortal.

137
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,760
As you haven’t recovered,

138
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
don’t think too much.

139
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,220
Please have a rest.

140
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,340
You killed my dad

141
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,820
and Auntie Lin Xiu!

142
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,060
I did kill him.

143
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,860
Immortal, you just came to yourself

144
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,700
and haven’t recovered yet.

145
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,220
Please don’t overly grieve.

146
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,940
Mi.

147
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,200
Mi.

148
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,820
Mi.

149
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,740
Kuang Lu, you can leave.

150
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,620
Mi, finally you recover your consciousness.

151
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,460
Do you feel any discomfort?

152
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,000
I...

153
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
It hurts.

154
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,060
It hurts.

155
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,532
Where?

156
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,325
I can transfer magic power to you

157
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,820
to ease your pain, OK?

158
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
I don’t know.

159
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,480
I feel

160
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,020
it expands from my chest

161
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,140
to the whole body.

162
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,580
I feel that I’m cut by knives
and probed by stone needles.

163
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,305
I can’t tell it.

164
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,848
I just feel that

165
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,380
my whole body is aching.

166
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,780
It,

167
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,280
it, it hurts,

168
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,520
but I don’t know

169
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
where it hurts.

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,700
My mouth is bitter.

171
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,280
OK, Mi,

172
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,100
take sweets and it won’t be bitter.

173
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,960
Here, Mi.

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,298
How are you?

175
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:16,090
Do you feel better?

176
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,600
Mi.

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,060
Mi.

178
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,480
Mi.

179
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,140
It’ll be fine, Mi.

180
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,120
It’ll be fine.

181
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,800
Everything is going to be all right.

182
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,880
Everything is going to be all right.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Mi, look.

184
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,340
The night-blooming cereus under the tree

185
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,246
keeps blooming for you.

186
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:49,706
How beautiful!

187
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,000
After you recover,

188
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,320
we’ll hold another wedding ceremony

189
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,340
in this spring, OK?

190
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
Fairy Shangyuan.

191
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,560
Your Majesty.

192
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,580
Kuang Lu helped me a lot

193
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,580
to rectify Heaven Realm

194
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,160
in the past half a year.

195
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,660
Your Majesty, she was of little help,

196
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,559
but you promoted her to Fairy Shangyuan

197
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,540
and gave her Xuanzhou Fairyland.

198
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,540
Thank you very much.

199
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,380
I’m strict and fair in meeting out
rewards and punishments.

200
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,020
She works properly and discreetly,

201
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,860
so she deserves these rewards.

202
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,620
Your Majesty,

203
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,740
I don’t need these possessions.

204
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,200
I just want to serve you.

205
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,120
I gave you the fairyland

206
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,520
as a place for editing

207
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,180
the astronomical calendar of Heaven Realm.

208
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,130
The climate and other natural phenomena of a season

209
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,423
are important to the livelihood of six realms.

210
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,080
The old calendar is inaccurate
and against the farming season.

211
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,140
It’s urgent to make a new one.

212
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,120
It’s a heavy task.

213
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,540
I know it.

214
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,200
I’ll try my best.

215
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,780
Get up.

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,438
Your Majesty,

217
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,356
Water Immortal just recovered her consciousness

218
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,000
and is still very weak.

219
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,440
I remember

220
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,860
my father gave Supreme Lord Lao an elixir

221
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,500
for tranquilizing and  nourishing vitality.

222
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,440
We can try it on her.

223
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,480
No need.

224
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,994
It's a sore point with her

225
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:58,788
Elixirs won’t work.

226
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,360
Give her more time.

227
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,920
Yes.

228
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,940
By the way, Your Majesty,

229
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,820
these are the related documents and evidence

230
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,920
of the case of the late Water Immortal.

231
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,560
After you read them,

232
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
I’ll keep them on file.

233
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,980
No need.

234
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,320
I trust you.

235
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,160
Keep these documents

236
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,880
on file carefully in the Archives Pavilion

237
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,480
of Pixiang Hall personally,

238
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,062
lest she think of her dad sadly upon seeing them

239
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,605
as she just recovered her consciousness.

240
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, I’ll deal with it now.

241
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,080
I’ll leave.

242
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
Your Majesty, I’ll leave too.

243
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,340
These are for you.

244
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,340
They are seeds of night-blooming cereus

245
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,580
which just blooms at night

246
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,020
and sleeps most of the day.

247
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,360
I think your habit is somewhat the same,

248
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,700
so I give it to you

249
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,640
to keep your company.

250
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Mi,

251
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,840
everything in the past

252
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,760
isn’t important any more.

253
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,880
The old men and past things

254
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,240
will vanish.

255
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,100
I won’t let you suffer any pain.

256
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,920
We’ll lead

257
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,240
a peaceful and happy life,

258
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,040
OK?

259
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,000
Xu Feng.

260
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,340
Why are you here?

261
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,600
You come to see how miserable I am, right?

262
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,180
You still have a bad temper.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
If you’re miserable,

264
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,920
I’d like to congratulate you.

265
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,080
Don’t be pleased too early.

266
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,400
After Xu Feng becomes Heavenly Emperor,

267
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
he’ll take me out.

268
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,600
By then, I won’t let you go.

269
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,320
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

270
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
You have no idea.

271
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,320
Half a year ago,

272
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,560
Xu Feng failed in the mutiny

273
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,393
on my wedding day with Jin Mi

274
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,860
so he was killed

275
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,800
with his essence destroyed.

276
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,100
That’s impossible.

277
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,580
Stop kidding.

278
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
Wait.

279
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
And

280
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,162
my father was so distressed at Xu Feng’s death

281
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:53,997
that he destroyed his own primordial spirit

282
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
to kill himself.

283
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,587
Impossible.

284
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:02,714
That’s impossible.

285
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,960
You’re kidding me.

286
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,520
You’re kidding me.

287
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,960
Your Majesty.

288
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,480
Your Majesty?

289
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,365
It doesn’t matter.

290
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:31,449
Just leave.

291
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,140
-Yes.
-Yes.

292
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,037
That’s impossible.

293
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:37,914
You’re kidding me.

294
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,960
You’re kidding me.

295
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,800
You’re kidding me.

296
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,420
Why?

297
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,460
Why?

298
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,600
Even though you hate me,

299
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,880
you shouldn’t kill Xu Feng.

300
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,380
He treated you as his elder brother.

301
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,080
What did he do?

302
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,700
He was innocent.

303
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Tell me.

304
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,740
What did my mother do?

305
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,120
What did Jin Mi do?

306
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,860
Thousands of members of
the Water Family in Lize Pond 

307
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
were innocent.

308
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,243
When you killed my mother,

309
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:18,870
eliminated her family

310
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,260
and plotted to murder Jin Mi,

311
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,980
were you softhearted?

312
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,980
When you killed others

313
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,980
for my father,

314
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,840
did you ever think that they were innocent

315
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,760
and had families?

316
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,000
I should never have brought you back.

317
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,360
I should have killed you

318
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,740
to avoid today’s disaster.

319
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,740
You’re right.

320
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,948
I’m just a puppet

321
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,480
you used to strive for Father’s favor and take credit,

322
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,320
but you didn’t expect that

323
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,120
I would be against you some day.

324
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,300
You think

325
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,800
I’m willing to witness my birth dad

326
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,100
and brother

327
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,860
died in front of me?

328
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,360
No, I’m not!

329
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,860
You should kill me in the beginning.

330
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,240
Maybe

331
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,560
I could free myself early

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,640
if you killed me.

333
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,180
Both of Xu Feng and His Majesty died.

334
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,580
It’s meaningless for me to go on living.

335
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,780
Kill me.

336
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
OK.

337
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,020
If you don’t want to live,
you can jump down from here.

338
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Back then,

339
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,220
the past Floral Immortal was
forced to jump down from here

340
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,860
after being burnt by your Glazed Pure Fire.

341
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,860
Mother,

342
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,960
you’re always superior,

343
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,960
but you should know

344
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,100
many immortals die under here

345
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,360
and many living beings

346
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,060
make contributions to your high status.

347
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,060
If you really want to die,

348
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,080
jump down from here

349
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,740
and have a look

350
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,440
at those innocent living beings

351
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,940
who were killed by you.

352
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,980
Have a look at them.

353
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,820
Mother,

354
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,340
I won’t allow you to die so easily.

355
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,400
I want you to be alive

356
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,520
and experience such feelings
of losing your husband and son

357
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,120
and see how I, your rebellious son

358
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,880
unify the Heaven Realm

359
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,620
and pacify it for long.

360
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,060
Xu.

361
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,560
Xu.

362
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,020
Xu.

363
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Xu.

364
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,980
Mom!

365
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,700
I’m tired.

366
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,980
Hug me like this for a while.

367
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
You’re late.

368
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,620
Drink a cup of wine as a punishment.

369
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,860
I put it out.

370
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,640
I set fire.

371
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,460
I put it out again.

372
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,040
I set fire again.

373
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,960
He is just an encumbrance

374
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
after a night of romance of His Majesty.

375
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,340
He doesn’t surpass the second Prince.

376
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,740
After marrying Fire Immortal

377
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,000
and becoming his wife

378
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,140
in the future,

379
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,140
you have to reduce

380
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,140
to respecting Night Immortal.

381
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,580
Stop talking about

382
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
this undetermined thing,

383
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,660
but for the second Prince…

384
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,786
I'm flattered.

385
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:51,537
I don’t deserve it.

386
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,705
-Your Highness.
-The second Prince.

387
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:53,640
We…

388
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,220
The first Prince always speaks and acts
cautiously and lives a simple life.

389
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,220
When did he offend you?

390
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,860
Should I apologize to you for him?

391
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,360
Your Highness, don’t take it seriously.

392
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,740
Just now we were just saying it.

393
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,300
Someone who loves and respects others

394
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,760
will be also loved and respected by others.

395
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,220
Night Immortal is my elder brother.

396
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,460
I always respect and think highly of him

397
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,520
and won’t treat him casually.

398
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,980
What do you mean?

399
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,560
Your Highness, sorry. I’m wrong.

400
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,860
I shouldn’t say that.

401
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,860
Princess Sui He is pampered.

402
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,000
If she really marries me in the future,

403
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,520
she has to please, respect and
treat Night Immortal as her elder brother.

404
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,900
I really worry she will be wronged.

405
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,640
You’re right.

406
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,820
As the princess of the Bird Family,

407
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,587
I should speak and act cautiously.

408
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,339
Thank you for reminding.

409
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,060
No need.

410
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
I’m leaving.

411
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,615
Run Yu,

412
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:15,576
don’t mind their words.

413
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,400
They’re right,

414
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,120
but I won’t mind their words.

415
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,700
No matter how they talk about me,

416
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,640
Sui He is really kind to you.

417
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,640
Don’t offend her for my sake.

418
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,660
Otherwise, Mother will…

419
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
I just want them to know

420
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,160
I don’t allow them to offend you.

421
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,200
Well, forget it.

422
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,271
Don’t have a stormy relationship

423
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:46,540
because of me.

424
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,560
Here you are.

425
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,460
What’s this?

426
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,780
Open it and have a look.

427
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,100
So mysterious.

428
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,380
You get them from Zifangyun Palace?

429
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,660
I have recovered early,

430
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,940
but you’re poisoned by fire and injured.

431
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,540
It can nourish your body.

432
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,740
Thank you.

433
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,960
I’m going to the drill ground.

434
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,060
Wait a minute.

435
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,340
This is Sparkling Aqua-essence.

436
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,460
It can relieve the ice toxin in your body.

437
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,060
I can use it to make tea.

438
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,060
Thank you.

439
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,000
Xu Feng,

440
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,220
you’re dead,

441
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,000
but why do you always appear in front of me?

442
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,620
You’re always superior,

443
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,580
spoiled and loved by others.

444
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,540
Everyone regards you as a bright sun,

445
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,420
admires your excellence

446
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,420
and eulogizes your feats.

447
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,280
I’m also excellent,

448
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,120
but I have no choice.

449
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,800
You,

450
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,500
you always gave me things,

451
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,440
but you never asked me

452
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,280
whether I wanted them.

453
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,440
Now I tell you,

454
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
I don’t want them.

455
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,380
I don’t want

456
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,040
your hypocritical rewards and mercy

457
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,120
and even your alms.

458
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,780
Xu Feng, do you know?

459
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,900
In the past,

460
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,140
I always hoped I could become stronger,

461
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,080
because I hoped

462
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,380
I could give you what you wanted

463
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,400
some day,

464
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,760
but later I finally realized that

465
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,080
with you,

466
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,740
I wouldn’t become the stronger one forever.

467
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,860
Tai Wei was shrewd all his life,

468
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,020
but he was killed his son.

469
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,960
Night Immortal killed his dad and young brother

470
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,380
as Tai Wei did in the past.

471
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,460
Maybe Tai Wei didn’t expect it.

472
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,020
He deserves it.

473
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,391
My Lord,

474
00:33:17,766 --> 00:33:19,643
Night Immortal just ascended the throne.

475
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,021
Now Heaven Realm isn’t stable

476
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,105
and immortals aren’t of one mind.

477
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,420
It’s a good time to attack Heaven Realm.

478
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,340
You’re right.

479
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,111
In the past six months,

480
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:33,660
I recruit followers to enlarge
the forces of our Demon Realm,

481
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,400
hoping to fight against Heaven Realm heartily.

482
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,080
Tai Wei,

483
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,880
I’ll realize the great aspiration of unifying the six realms

484
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,000
that you didn’t realize.

485
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,480
Jin Mi has awaked?

486
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,380
What do you want to do?

487
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,420
I regret stopping you

488
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,320
from killing her with Spirit-Vanishing
Arrow in the mortal world.

489
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,720
I planned to kill her,

490
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,720
but you stopped me.

491
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,540
I didn’t know she was so despicable.

492
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,880
I’m so blind

493
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,460
to treat her as my good friend.

494
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,520
Let me kill her to revenge Xu Feng.

495
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,580
I know you hate Jin Mi

496
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,000
because of Xu Feng,

497
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,745
but now Run Yu has become Heavenly Emperor.

498
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,500
We can’t change anything.

499
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,080
I really don’t understand.

500
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,720
Why does the world become like this?

501
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,360
It’s common that mortals kill others
to fight for the throne,

502
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,546
but why are Heaven Realm and Demon Realm

503
00:34:32,546 --> 00:34:33,480
which have been peaceful for 10,000 years

504
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,620
also in chaos?

505
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,900
As a son and minister, Run Yu seized his dad’s power,

506
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,100
but he is still righteous?

507
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,400
You’re right,

508
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,972
but you should know

509
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,974
the new Heavenly Emperor just ascended the throne,

510
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
and we don’t know how he’ll treat our Demon Realm,

511
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,760
so we must take the long view

512
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,940
and follow the tendency.

513
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,720
Follow the tendency?

514
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,320
It’s none of our business.

515
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,320
It’s the best that King of Gu City
fights against Run Yu

516
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,640
and neither of them gains.

517
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,900
Keep your voice down.

518
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,780
King of Gu City is Demon Lord now.

519
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,825
Even your uncle and dad have to show their respect

520
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,820
when meeting him.

521
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,720
Moreover,

522
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,500
if King of Qing City didn’t mediate in it,

523
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,840
we would be eliminated from Demon Realm.

524
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,380
If you meet him later, be respectful.

525
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,480
Heavenly Emperor and Demon Lord

526
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,760
are shameless men of no scruples now.

527
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,220
The peace of six realms

528
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,720
will be destroyed by them some day.

529
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,000
By the way,

530
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,900
as Run Yu ascended the throne,

531
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,820
Jin Mi will be Heavenly Empress soon.

532
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,820
Heavenly Empress!

533
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,040
They collude in doing evil.

534
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,800
What a good match!

535
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,900
I was blind before.

536
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,340
I’ll kill her when I meet her later.

537
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,340
Calm down.

538
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,340
We were not present that day.

539
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,480
I always think that

540
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,800
perhaps there is something unknown to us.

541
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
I don’t care.

542
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,040
It’s true that she killed Xu Feng.

543
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,286
Xu Feng just made effort in vain to love.

544
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,790
Immortal,

545
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:38,834
when you fainted, His Majesty

546
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,800
planted night-blooming cereus

547
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,060
and watered it with magic power personally.

548
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,300
It’ll bloom even in the daytime,

549
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,440
so you can see it after
recovering your consciousness.

550
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,160
It’s said that phoenix flowers
in the mortal world blooms in two seasons.

551
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,980
One brings fate, and the other takes away fate.

552
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,340
I use magic power

553
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,880
to make it bloom forever.

554
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,560
People will part with each other eventually.

555
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,820
Blooms and dead flowers will fall without exception.

556
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,360
Mi.

557
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,100
Mi, what’s wrong?

558
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,900
I’m fine.

559
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,220
Don’t keep it to yourself.

560
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,520
What I promised to you have all been fulfilled.

561
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,860
Now,

562
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,960
those who once hurt you

563
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,520
have been punished.

564
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,340
The dethroned Heavenly Empress

565
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,940
is locked up in the extremely cold Linyuan Tower

566
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,760
and lives a very miserable life.

567
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,340
And

568
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,956
you killed Xu Feng

569
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,980
as he killed your dad.

570
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,620
As you’ve avenged,

571
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,280
Floral Immortal, Water Immortal and Wind Immortal

572
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,680
can rest in peace.

573
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,740
Mi.

574
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,940
Mi.

575
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,300
Mi, I know.

576
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,460
As you lost your closest relatives

577
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,680
and experienced the decisive moment,

578
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,540
you’re suffering and struggling.

579
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,660
You’re finished with Xu Feng.

580
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,660
You just did what you were supposed to do.

581
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,260
Don’t torture yourself.

582
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,040
Everything is going to be all right.

583
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,760
Your Highness.

584
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,200
Do you want some raisins?

585
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:23,408
These raisins...

586
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:26,180
are soft, sticky and firm,
the sweetness is just right,

587
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,680
They are of top grade of raisins.

588
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,800
Have a try.

589
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,500
Why do you like raisins so much?

590
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,740
Well, we are what we eat.

591
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,940
Don’t you want to try?

592
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,800
If you go on like this,

593
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,000
I will feed you in the way I did last time.

594
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,560
Mi,

595
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,880
Xu Feng has been gone.

596
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Afterwards,

597
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,300
no matter whether you’re happy or sad,

598
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,680
I’ll be always by your side.

599
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,140
After you recover,

600
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,360
I’ll hold a grand wedding ceremony for you.

601
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,748
We’ll live a life like this

602
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:18,060
in the next thousands of years.

603
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,840
OK?

604
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,100
Why?

605
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,040
You killed my dad

606
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,600
and Auntie Lin Xiu.

607
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,020
Have you loved me?

608
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,900
He made mistakes,

609
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,220
but why do I cry?
