1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 25"

3
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,980
Invite Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family now.

4
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,420
Yes.

5
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,720
General Qin.

6
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,420
What’s wrong with His Majesty?

7
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,200
His Majesty is unwell.
Your Excellencies, please go back.

8
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,020
Minister, please wait.

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,740
Get out of the way!

10
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,200
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

11
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Minister Fu. Duke Nanping.

12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you have anything important to report?

13
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Your Majesty, you feel unwell, so we are so worried.

14
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,260
I have been in a cold recently.

15
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
It’s a minor illness. Don’t worry.

16
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,840
Is there any urgent report from the border?

17
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,360
All the main forces of Liangguo withdrew.

18
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,500
Your Majesty, don’t worry.

19
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,420
Minister Fu is in command to deal with
military affairs and important things,

20
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,340
so you can rest easy, Your Majesty.

21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,620
Other officials and I will also help him sincerely.

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,360
With you two,

23
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,740
I feel so contented.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Your Majesty, here comes Saint Girl.

25
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,360
Summon her.

26
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,200
Do you have anything else to say?

27
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,620
Your Majesty, please rest without worry.

28
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,860
-We’ll leave.
-We’ll leave.

29
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,180
Minister, please wait.

30
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,420
His Majesty is unwell by accident.

31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,100
Why am I in command to deal with
military affairs and important things?

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,880
Duke, I can’t

33
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,180
stand your groundless pretence up.

34
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,880
Minister.

35
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,880
Minister, don’t embarrass me.

36
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,760
His Majesty is unwell, so it’s reasonable for you

37
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,300
to deal with state affairs on behalf of him.

38
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:26,460
Minister, did I misread?

39
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,520
I saw His Majesty seemed to spit blood.

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
What do you think?

41
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,000
I also saw that.

42
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,289
In your opinion, His Majesty
suffers from some severe illness

43
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,340
rather than cold.

44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,669
I am afraid that

45
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,200
His Majesty falls ill from overwork

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,440
and lots of hardships on earlier expedition wars.

47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Surely,

48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,740
the condition also depends on
the diagnosis of Saint Girl.

49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,220
His Majesty was in army for half a life.

50
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,400
In recent years, he has been
busy with government affairs

51
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,720
and had no time to marry consorts,
so he still has no son.

52
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,280
We keep submitting memorials,

53
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
but His Majesty ignored us.

54
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
Once His Majesty has bad health,

55
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,660
whom will he give the throne to?

56
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,540
Whom, indeed?

57
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,340
It’s a misfortune for the state and families.

58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,120
The deceased emperor advocated imprisonment
and His Majesty’s blood relationships

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,520
were all killed.

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,660
Now,

61
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,160
even no one can be adopted by him.

62
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,680
Duke, please.

63
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,360
Minister, please.

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,020
Take care.

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,360
Go to arrange

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,980
so that princess can come here
to pay respects to His Majesty

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,000
and sound out his illness condition tomorrow.

68
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,660
Yes.

69
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,400
Today King Yi didn’t hold court due to illness.

70
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Spread this piece of news

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,580
in secret.

72
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,820
Remember to keep it a secret from princess

73
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,440
before she comes

74
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,880
to prevent her from making a
wrong judgment due to care.

75
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I see.

76
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,040
It’s his breath.

77
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,300
Mu Ci, I know it’s you.

78
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?

79
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,060
Why haven’t you meet me since you save me?

80
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,740
You even took away the only gift you gave me.

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,980
Now that you want to draw a line with me

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,260
Well,

83
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,440
I’ll give my life right back to you now.

84
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,220
From then on,

85
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,420
we don’t owe each other.

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
You haven’t come out.

87
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,800
Well.

88
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,120
I know you care about me.

89
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
Even if you don’t want to take off your mask,

90
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,320
I also know you are Mu Ci.

91
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,500
You shouldn’t have gambled

92
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,460
with your life.

93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
If not,

94
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
you wouldn’t have come out to see me.

95
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,840
It shows I won.

96
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
Go back now.

97
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,580
Those chasing to kill you

98
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
will come again after a failure.

99
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,840
Be careful of your own safety.

100
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,680
Mu Ci.

101
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,600
Return my brass strip to me before leaving.

102
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,000
Why haven’t you admitted you are Mu Ci?

103
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,060
Do you know how much I want to see you again?

104
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,040
That Mu Ci you mentioned

105
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,000
has been gone.

106
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,660
All people think you died,

107
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,480
but I don’t think so.

108
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,220
I know you must be alive

109
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,120
and you will come back to meet me.

110
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,580
It seems that we are different

111
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,580
in the definition of being alive.

112
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,540
What actually happened back then?

113
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Why did you disappear

114
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
after there was Nether Fury in Wangchuan River?

115
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,620
Mu Ci, what actually happened back then?

116
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,500
-Demon Lord.
-Demon Lord.

117
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,820
My Lord.

118
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,920
My Lord.

119
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,880
Demon Lord, Mu Ci

120
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,900
was accidentally hurt by Liu Ying 1,000 years ago.

121
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,240
King of Bian City thought he was alone and helpless,

122
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
so he took him back and brought him up in his mansion.

123
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,060
He has practiced magic

124
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,700
with two princes and Liu Ying since childhood,

125
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,880
showing no abnormity.

126
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,760
But Nether Fury appeared without reason today,

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
which is a bad omen.

128
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,180
He could solve it easily.

129
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,700
He has black pupils.

130
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,920
Only the pure bloodline of Spirit-Vanishing Family

131
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,160
can have this abnormity after growing up.

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
But I did

133
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,820
kill the whole Spirit-Vanishing Family back then.

134
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,940
Unexpectedly,

135
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,800
there is still a leftover evil of Spirit-Vanishing Family.

136
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,400
Back then, Spirit-Vanishing Family rebelled

137
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,300
to try to overthrow our Demon Realm.

138
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,720
Luckily, Your Majesty was wise and resolute,

139
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,040
so a disaster was avoided.

140
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,460
To leave no chance for their revival, we must kill him.

141
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,440
My Lord, I am not a different family.

142
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,600
Please let me out.

143
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,460
You aren’t from a different family?

144
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,440
It’s obvious to people of the whole Demon Realm that

145
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,380
you hurt Liu Ying by Wangchuan River.

146
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,880
Don’t quibble.

147
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,260
I hurt Princess Liu Ying?

148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,520
So, how was she then?

149
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,480
My Lord,

150
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,660
we can’t take such an evil lightly.

151
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,000
We’d better seal him

152
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
and throw him into Yu Abyss right now.

153
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,440
I hurt Princess?

154
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
I hurt Princess?

155
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,820
I hurt Princess?

156
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,940
OK, I’ll leave it to you.

157
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,140
Remember not to make any trouble again.

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,740
Yes.

159
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,700
You don’t need to know what happened before.

160
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Just remember there is no Mu Ci

161
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,200
in this world.

162
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,380
I know you’ve suffered a lot.

163
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,980
Mu Ci, go back to Demon Realm with me.

164
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,640
As usual, we can

165
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,100
practice martial arts and…

166
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,340
Mu Ci, don’t go.

167
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,160
Don’t leave me, OK?

168
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
As fast as wind.

169
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,120
As slow as the slowly spreading forest.

170
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,980
Attack like fire.

171
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,560
Defend like mountain.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,040
Difficult to predict the movement when motionless.

173
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,280
Take action at lightening speed.

174
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,100
You’ve progressed.

175
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,860
Of course.

176
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,360
When you were out,

177
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,940
I learnt military strategies and tactics hard.

178
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I heard from Qin Tong that

179
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,672
you had taken away

180
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:26,860
all the “Seven Military Classics” in my study.

181
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,000
I remember you didn’t like martial arts before.

182
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
I couldn’t understand them when I was young,

183
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,120
but I find I am deeply attracted by them

184
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,760
after several years.

185
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,700
The art of war is like the feeling of the world,

186
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,020
so we should be clear-sighted
at the situation and popular feeling.

187
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,272
As the saying goes, there are
different situations in deployment of army

188
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,439
like the water flows without a fixed shape.

189
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,320
Those with foresights will win.

190
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,820
No wonder you always read.

191
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,140
Fortunately, you are enlightened late,

192
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,860
or you, the General Feifeng of Huaiwu

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,980
might own my title God of War.

194
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,440
Don’t laugh at me, Cousin.

195
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,300
As a woman, I don’t dare to talk about
affairs of state defense and administration.

196
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,980
I just know little

197
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,120
under your influence.

198
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,500
It’s a pity that I am not a man,

199
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,940
or I can serve as a pawn and pacesetter

200
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
under your command.

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
Your Majesty, it’s time for you to take medicine.

202
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,400
Your Majesty, here are our respects.

203
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,320
Who are they?

204
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,040
Jin Mi of Saint Doctors’ Family.

205
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,760
Qiang Huo of Saint Doctors’ Family.

206
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,040
Princess, here are our respects.
May you great happiness.

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,540
Are you the famous female doctors
of Saint Doctors’ Family?

208
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,060
Your Highness, you flatter us.

209
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,100
Our family always lives in seclusion
from the earthly world,

210
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,500
so we aren’t famous at all.

211
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,940
Because of so,

212
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,840
there are many rumors about you in the human world.

213
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,520
I’ve long heard that Saint Doctors’ Family act secretly

214
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,500
and need to observe numerous rules.

215
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,640
You do impress me a lot today.

216
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
But why do you cover your faces with veils?

217
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Covering face with veil is
a century-old tradition of our family.

218
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
The female doctor of our family
begins to wear veil since childhood.

219
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,940
We also wear veils when
presenting ourselves to His Majesty.

220
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,100
I am not a king.
How about letting me look at your face?

221
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,000
It seems that I have no qualification.

222
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,160
No. No.

223
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,540
We are ugly and afraid to scare you.

224
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,280
Your saying

225
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,500
even arouses my curiosity.

226
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,220
They have strict family rules, so don’t force them.

227
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Saint Doctors’ Family is loyal to the royal family all the time.

228
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,780
Cousin, you may make a decree

229
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,980
to abolish their bad habit.

230
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,860
If all of them cover their faces with veils,

231
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,100
spies and assassins may sneak into the palace

232
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,240
to hurt you, Cousin.

233
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,420
Cousin.

234
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,220
Cousin, are you OK? Cousin.

235
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,940
Cousin.

236
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
Cousin. Cousin.

237
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
How is His Majesty?

238
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
On the way here,

239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
I just heard His Majesty was unwell.

240
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Seeing he brandished a sword vigorously,

241
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,780
I thought his illness was just a rumor.

242
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,740
It seems true now.

243
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,360
Your Highness,

244
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,660
His Majesty has kidney yang and blood failure,

245
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,860
so he is impotent.

246
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
He just coughs.

247
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,540
Why, why is he impotent?

248
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,560
Rome is not built in one day.

249
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
His Highness falls ill from
overwork throughout the year.

250
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,500
Now he is extremely weak.

251
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,760
Besides kidney yang and blood failure,

252
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,760
His Majesty also has five taxations
and seven damages,

253
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,400
so he often has prostration, coughs

254
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,620
and blood in phlegm.

255
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,980
At first glance,

256
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,880
it is due to lung meridian,

257
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,420
but virtually

258
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,140
kidney meridian.

259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,980
Can he be curable?

260
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,440
As he is incurably ill, he approaches death.

261
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
But, please don’t worry, Your Highness.

262
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,860
I’ll treat His Majesty carefully.

263
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,420
Your Majesty.

264
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,440
Your Highness, Saint Girl of my family
has excellent medical skills,

265
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,620
so she’ll treat His Majesty with all her strength.

266
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,420
Depending on the situation,

267
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,560
His Majesty won’t wake up so soon.

268
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,140
Don’t be anxious here.

269
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,120
It’s not worth if you get ill due to tiredness.

270
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,660
How about going back for a rest first?

271
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,740
Once His Majesty comes round,

272
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,000
we’ll inform you at once.

273
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,240
I leave all that to you, Saint Girl.

274
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,940
Your Highness, don’t worry.

275
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,560
We’ll try our best.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,520
Qiang Huo, see Her Highness out.

277
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,340
Yes.

278
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,540
Your Highness, please.

279
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,500
If His Majesty gets better,

280
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,880
ensure to inform me first.

281
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,080
OK. Please don’t worry, Your Highness.

282
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,660
She loves you so deeply.

283
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,780
How is my acting skill?

284
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,980
Duke Nanping asked someone to send you a letter,

285
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,480
right?

286
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,440
How, how did Your Majesty know?

287
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
Now, with domestic trouble and foreign invasion,

288
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,227
Huaiwu is beset by uncertain border
and unstable court situation.

289
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,840
In the midst of war, people worry about their safety,

290
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
not to mention a good and prosperous life.

291
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,700
But being obsessed with ambition,
someone wants to kill me

292
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,600
and usurp the throne in chaos

293
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,840
for his own power and desire.

294
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,400
But it’ll take a long time

295
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,620
to eliminate the traitor.

296
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,680
Its hardships, advantages and disadvantages

297
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,080
can’t be expressed in a few words.

298
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,020
I did have some doubts about you
when you came in the beginning.

299
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,060
I was afraid you were really
on the side of Duke Nanping.

300
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,120
But you haven’t written back to Duke Nanping,

301
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,960
so I know

302
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,460
you are on my side, right?

303
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,660
Saint Doctors’ Family pledges loyalty to King Yi.

304
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,800
As Saint Girl, I don’t dare to neglect my mission.

305
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,180
Then tell Duke Nanping

306
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,720
I’ve been incurably ill and approached death.

307
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,340
Why?

308
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,120
In this case, he’ll drop his guard

309
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,060
and show his original face.

310
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,760
I can counterattack when he is off guard.

311
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,200
So I need your full cooperation.

312
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,020
As for what kind of serious illness I have,

313
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,320
you need to think about it.

314
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,500
Your acting skill has actually

315
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,640
reached a high degree of excellence.

316
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,838
I am gladly convinced,

317
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,214
admire you from the bottom of my heart

318
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
and bow to you in worship.

319
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,460
Don’t fool me.

320
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,460
We face

321
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,380
such traitor officials like Duke Nanping and Minister Fu,

322
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,760
hard-boiled and slippery persons
who have been in office for decades.

323
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,940
If they are put on the stage,

324
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,760
all of them will become famous actors.

325
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,140
We should be full of spirit and energy.

326
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes.

327
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,060
It’s all your fault.

328
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
You tell them I am a patient
with deficiency of the kidney

329
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
and can’t have sexual intercourse.

330
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,680
How can I face them later?

331
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,180
Well, is,

332
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,980
isn't this Your Majesty’s meaning?

333
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,720
What?

334
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,460
What’s this?

335
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,800
Qiang Huo can understand
and get you medicine by prescription.

336
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,060
Powder for the Seven Emotions Medicament can fully achieve

337
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,560
Your Majesty’s desired effect.

338
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,980
But with seven emotions,

339
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
people have different reactions due to external stimulation

340
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,420
and express them in lines, which is natural.

341
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
The medicine can reverse veins

342
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,700
and forcibly take away one’s feelings,

343
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,780
so one can take it for a long time.

344
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,720
If you must take it,

345
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,760
remember not to get too happy or sad.

346
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,640
You’d better take it with Golden Chamber Pill

347
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,900
to slow medicine resistance.

348
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,000
OK, you can arrange it.

349
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,100
The crafty and suspicious Duke Nanping

350
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,900
may not believe so easily,

351
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,160
so he’ll send Sui He

352
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
to sound out my condition in two or three days.

353
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,780
You cooperate with me

354
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,740
to act before Sui He by then.

355
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,860
Your Majesty,

356
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,380
are you tired of

357
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,420
scheming against them every day?

358
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,000
I am just a doctor rather than an actress.

359
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,360
I am unmarried,

360
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,360
but now you widely spread
I can’t have sexual intercourse,

361
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,980
breaking my reputation.

362
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,880
If I am alone

363
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,440
and childless later,

364
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,940
who will accompany me?
You?

365
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,180
Your, Your, Your Majesty, calm down.

366
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,300
After taking the Seven Emotions Medicament,
you can’t become emotional or angry.

367
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
I heard

368
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,426
people have seven emotions and
change their emotions with the environment change.

369
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,060
If the environment changes,
people’s emotions will be stimulated and changed.

370
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,400
Now only the secret behind the veil

371
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,020
can make my emotions fluctuant

372
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,840
and make me be lost in a reverie.

373
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,240
Both Sui He

374
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,100
and I

375
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,060
are curious about your look.

376
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,880
Your Majesty,

377
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,520
it’s said by Confucius:

378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,140
“I’ve never seen anyone who
loves morality just like loving a beauty.”

379
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,720
Your Majesty, please be self-possessed.
And I look…

380
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,460
You look ugly and are disliked by all people?

381
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,160
I don’t care.

382
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,520
When we were in Luoye Mountain,

383
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,500
we stayed in the same room for over a month.

384
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,640
I know your character well.

385
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,560
I don’t see my lover,
so I am care-laden like entranced.

386
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,340
What can I do?
You’ve forgotten me.

387
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,700
I don’t dare.

388
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,420
When we stayed in the mountain,

389
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,980
you were so bold.

390
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,200
You found chances to have physical contact with me.

391
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,220
After treating me flippantly in the mountain,

392
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,880
you actually want to disown me

393
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,360
and be irresponsible for me.

394
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Do you

395
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,720
have special love

396
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,480
for mountain bandit?

397
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,300
I am terrified as I am guilty.

398
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
I, I am very guilty and deserve death.

399
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,820
Don’t always talk about death.

400
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,300
I know you cherish your life.

401
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,900
No.

402
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,440
Though I cherish my life,

403
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,760
I pledge loyalty to Your Majesty more,

404
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,940
or I don’t help Your Majesty deal with Duke Nanping

405
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,520
without consideration of life and death.

406
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,720
I never want your loyalty.

407
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,420
Well,

408
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,120
many a day will come yet.

409
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,860
One day,

410
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,320
I will make you willingly remove the veil.

411
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,880
Your Majesty,

412
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,540
with the bounden duty
as a saint girl of Saint Doctors’ Family,

413
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,340
I need to observe both
Your Majesty’s orders and my family rules

414
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,780
and don’t dare to go off the rails.

415
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,560
I have no other merits

416
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,520
except loyalty.

417
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,620
I can’t give what Your Majesty wants.

418
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,380
Though we had a good time in the mountain,

419
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,600
it isn’t the life of Your Majesty

420
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,880
and me.

421
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,620
About the time in the mountain,

422
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,040
please just take it as a dream, Your Majesty.

423
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,740
I almost couldn’t control myself.

424
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,640
As the emperor of a state, so enchanting

425
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
that I was even trapped.

426
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,360
You came up with this dumb idea.

427
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,780
What dumb book is this?

428
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
The words of sages

429
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,700
featured by ideas without evil,
such as abstemious joy and sadness.

430
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,920
Unexpectedly, Saint Girl was scared away.

431
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,700
Your Majesty, the love between
man and woman is like march to war.

432
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,780
Besides fine weather, favorable geographical
and human conditions,

433
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,220
tactics and ideas are also important.

434
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,180
When the enemy advance, we retreat
and when the enemy retreat, we chase.

435
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,700
Your Majesty loves Saint Girl

436
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,240
who is dignified and stable,

437
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,800
so the ordinary positional warfare is infeasible.

438
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,820
You should adopt the city seizure tough warfare
of strengthening the defenses and clear the fields.

439
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
You are an expert.

440
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,840
Fellow officers and I

441
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,420
think about two things all our lives,

442
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,560
namely protecting our homes and defending our state

443
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,844
and carrying on the family line.

444
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,460
Good.

445
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
Go to fetch “Wuzi” for me.

446
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,980
I want that volume with notes I made in spring.

447
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,420
“Wuzi Art of War”?

448
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,740
It was borrowed away by Princess Nanping.

449
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,320
What about “Six Secret Teachings”?

450
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,420
Your Majesty, do you forget

451
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,780
all the Seven Military Classics
were borrowed away by Princess?

452
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,570
Hasn’t she finished reading them?

453
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:11,572
Go to get them back from her.

454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,020
Your Majesty, do you forget

455
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
now you are unconscious due to illness?

456
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,300
So how can you make an order?

457
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,880
Yes.

458
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,100
Get them back some other day

459
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,600
when I cure

460
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,160
my kidney.

461
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Leave.

462
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,920
So terrible.

463
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,660
Jin Mi is double-faced

464
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,260
and Xu Feng also irritates me.

465
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,440
He actually only listened to Jin Mi verbally.

466
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,680
Well, if it goes on like this,

467
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,760
when will they be together?

468
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,460
It worries me a lot.

469
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,240
This part was over.

470
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,120
You’re to blame. It’s all your fault.

471
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,520
You banished Jin Mi

472
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,540
to the hated Saint Doctors’ Family.

473
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,740
I think

474
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,420
you just envy at

475
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,300
her youth and beauty,

476
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,260
so you don’t want her to have a happy marriage

477
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,860
and arranged her

478
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,140
a fate that is doomed to loneliness.

479
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,900
Damn fox, how can you blame me?

480
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,300
You were there back then.

481
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,540
Recall carefully.

482
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
Who agreed to arrange her to Saint Doctors’ Family?

483
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,980
Who disallowed Jin Mi to experience
separation of lovers in mortal world?

484
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,980
It was your dear Second Nephew.

485
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,860
No one expected he would also
jump down to mortal world with her.

486
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,940
He hurt himself

487
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,240
by his own doing.

488
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,800
He deserves it.

489
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,700
Sui He.

490
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,140
Daddy.

491
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,020
What’s wrong?

492
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,460
Who makes you cry

493
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,700
so sadly?

494
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,660
Tell me.

495
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,540
Cousin.

496
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,940
His Majesty?

497
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,160
What did His Majesty do?

498
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,280
Cousin is…

499
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,360
Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Speak slowly.

500
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,880
Today I saw Cousin

501
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,380
coughed up a handful of blood

502
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,000
and passed out.

503
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,060
Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family
diagnosed His Majesty.

504
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,740
What did she say?

505
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,340
She said Cousin

506
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
was impotent with kidney deficiency
and five taxations and seven damages.

507
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
He has been incurably ill.

508
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,840
Daddy, what can I do?

509
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Find a way to save Cousin.

510
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,180
OK, don’t be afraid.
Don’t be afraid.

511
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,220
I’ll handle everything for you.

512
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,420
Fortunately, His Majesty’s father already passed away.

513
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,900
I’ll manage to cancel your engagement.

514
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,620
Daddy, what do you mean?

515
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,260
Don’t worry.

516
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,020
I won’t push you into the living hell.

517
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,848
You.

518
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,500
You.

519
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,560
You want…

520
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,000
As you see,

521
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
a wedding gown and a mourning gown.

522
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Since I was 12 years old,

523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,300
I’ve preparing a wedding gown for myself every year.

524
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,280
Also when I was 12 years old,

525
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,580
I first saw Cousin

526
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,760
returned from battlefield with wounds

527
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,020
and knew another fate

528
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,700
was waiting for me.

529
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Sui, how stupid you are!

530
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,140
Xu Feng crusaded everywhere,

531
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
so he won’t live long.

532
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,140
I know you’ve loved him passionately since childhood,

533
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,620
but we can’t

534
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,800
go against the heaven’s will.

535
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,680
As your father,

536
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,360
I won’t allow you to marry this autocrat.

537
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,020
It turns out that you think of him
in this way all the time.

538
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,340
You really disappoint me.

539
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,160
But I am afraid that I’ll also disappoint you.

540
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,400
I must marry Cousin this life.

541
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,840
Whether I live in widowhood
or can’t have any child later,

542
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,000
I won’t regret.

543
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,760
If I marry him, it’s my luck
and if not, it’s my fate.

544
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,700
Unless he dies,

545
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,740
no one

546
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,300
can separate us forcibly.

547
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,100
Qi Chong.

548
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,820
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

549
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,480
Go get Saint Girl.

550
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,760
I have something to discuss with her.

551
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,100
Yes.

552
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,140
What’s wrong with you?

553
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,340
I didn’t see you the whole afternoon.

554
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,960
Now you are back,

555
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,480
but you bend the brows.

556
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,600
Taste it now.

557
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,120
His Majesty just asked people
to send sweetmeats to us.

558
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,920
Having some sweet food,
you’ll become happy.

559
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,200
I just went to meet Duke Nanping.

560
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,100
Why did you meet him?

561
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,240
I was afraid that you would worry,

562
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,400
so I didn’t tell you.

563
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,680
But now…

564
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,320
Jin Mi, what actually happened?

565
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,820
I heard His Majesty’s illness condition

566
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,520
from my daughter.

567
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,520
You’ve done a good job.

568
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,160
My Lord, you flatter me.

569
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,980
In your opinion,

570
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,360
how long can King Yi live?

571
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,600
One year at most.

572
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,900
I haven’t told it to Her Highness,
or she may feel sad.

573
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Leave her alone.

574
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,900
Today I meet you

575
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,520
to let you manage

576
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,120
to reduce King Yi’s longevity

577
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,320
into 10 days.

578
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,860
10 days?

579
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,920
Yes.
The plan changes.

580
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,780
I can’t wait that long.

581
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,250
It’ll be the Meeting of Commanding Officers

582
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,376
10 days later

583
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,129
when civil and military officials and
border defending generals of various places

584
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,046
will come.

585
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,720
I’ll depose Xu Feng by then.

586
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,220
You should

587
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,380
exactly make him

588
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
be killed by poison

589
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,280
on the spot that day.

590
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,060
Yes.

591
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,220
Does Duke Nanping think he is the living Hades

592
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,720
who can determine the death time of a person?

593
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,540
Lower your voice.

594
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,700
Sit down.
Lower your voice.

595
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,400
Moreover,

596
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,740
he holds the lives of more than one hundred people

597
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,900
in our family this time.

598
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,840
It’s worse than last time.

599
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,540
Now he has sent killers into the village.

600
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,500
They’ll act according to the news 10 days later.

601
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,240
We can’t let Auntie die.

602
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,300
I know.

603
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,420
But if King Yi dies,

604
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,280
more people will suffer.

605
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,460
Why?

606
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,980
Now there is a state of chaos.

607
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,720
People are destitute.

608
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,720
But as for the places under the rule of King Yi,

609
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,300
wars are pacified and people live and work in peace.

610
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,800
If he dies,

611
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,040
who can save the living in water and fire?

612
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,340
I believe him.

613
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,900
If he can calm down the country,

614
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
he’ll create a peaceful, tranquil and prosperous age

615
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,000
without war and famine.

616
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,940
It sounds reasonable.

617
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
It’s too nerve-racking.

618
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,760
We can’t await our doom

619
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,160
in this way at all.

620
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,420
How about seeking advice from Auntie?

621
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,720
I also think so.

622
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,200
This is a matter of great importance.

623
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,060
We need to discuss with our auntie carefully.
