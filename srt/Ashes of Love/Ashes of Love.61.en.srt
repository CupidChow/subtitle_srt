1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 61"

3
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,440
You take care of yourself.

4
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,140
Long Live my Lord!

5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Our Lord just promised to spare your life,

6
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,180
But I didn't.

7
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,820
I'll have to settle accounts

8
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,740
with you for Mu Ci.

9
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Just come and kill me.

10
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,660
I am the Princess of Heaven Realm
and the leader of Bird Family.

11
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,240
How could I bear such a disgrace?

12
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,360
Forget it.

13
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,560
She's a wreck now.

14
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,680
Being alive

15
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,640
is more painful than death.

16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Just let her go.

17
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,760
You're right. Let her have her wish like this.

18
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,260
It's too kind for her.

19
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,420
What you must suffer should not be a little bit less.

20
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,500
Someone.

21
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
Your Highness.

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,980
Exile her in the wilderness.

23
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,240
She shall never step out of Demon Realm.

24
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,300
Yes.

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,280
You will get retribution!

26
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,100
How beautiful the wedding dress is.

27
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm afraid if I wear it too long

28
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,180
I'll be reluctant to take it off.

29
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,620
You can't even distinguish the colors.

30
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,900
How do you know it's beautiful?

31
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,740
Even I know what color it is,

32
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,120
it doesn't belong to me.

33
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,360
Marrying me

34
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,640
makes you feel so miserable?

35
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,700
You don't even want to wear it for a little bit longer.

36
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,820
That’s phony affection.

37
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,900
It's just a play.

38
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Why do you take it seriously?

39
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,720
What is this?

40
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
It's Hairy Feather.

41
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Run Yu added an extra medicine, cynanchum atratum

42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,460
in your Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir.

43
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,140
Hairy Feather can dissolve the
extreme chill of cynanchum atratum.

44
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
It can cure your countercharge.

45
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,620
Eat it.

46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
I promise,

47
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,320
I'll not bother you any more in the future.

48
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,920
You'll never see me again.

49
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,080
I won't eat it.

50
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,060
It's the last one grown over
the past ten thousand years.

51
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
And it's the last chance to
dissolve the countercharge of the elixir.

52
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,480
It's what I owe you.

53
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,040
I beg you.

54
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,160
Do you think

55
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,740
this can offset your sins?

56
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,160
Stop.

57
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,940
Do you know how I hate you?

58
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,620
I know.

59
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,780
But I hate myself more.

61
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,660
I've prepared for so many years

62
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,320
and stretched myself to hate you.

63
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,120
However, the two drops of blood
shed onto the heart-testing stone

64
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,360
made all of my efforts fall apart.

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,420
I hate myself that

66
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,740
I can't forget you by now.

67
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,840
Phoenix,

68
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
let's not cheat ourselves anymore.

69
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,200
I know what you said

70
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,600
was to let Sui He hear deliberately.

71
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,260
You wanted to force her
to use the Glazed Pure Flame, right?

72
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,700
Tonight,

73
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,500
you should have married another man,

74
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,380
but you came here.

75
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,580
and went through the heart test with me.

76
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,120
I really don't know

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,440
if it's not the will of the Heaven,

78
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,620
how can I explain it?

79
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,000
Phoenix,

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,720
can we

81
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,080
go back to the past?

82
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,860
No, we can't.

83
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,580
We can't anymore.

84
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,660
Perhaps,

85
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,680
we can make a fresh start.

86
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
From now onwards,

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,600
you and I should share the same mind.

88
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,880
Even when the years are chaotic,
and the waves are monstrous,

89
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,780
I'll also hold your hands tightly,

90
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,980
not leaving you till
we go to the primordial world together.

91
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
After all, I still can't

92
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,520
and don't want to let you go.

93
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,120
Just stay by my side

94
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
and don't lie to me again.

95
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,840
Otherwise,

96
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,420
I'll really go to the primordial world with you.

97
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,820
Father,

98
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,020
your lifetime wish

99
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,340
is to unite the six realms.

100
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,840
Otherwise, you would not have
kept Qiongqi alive, right?

101
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,820
This uncompleted work

102
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
will be accomplished by your son.

103
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
In the future,

104
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,020
among the six realms and four seas,

105
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,960
I'm the only lord.

106
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,580
The thunder and rain

107
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,640
will go from the Gate of Heaven;

108
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,940
if the Heavenly Emperor is enraged,

109
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,660
all should die.

110
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
My Majesty, the armies are ready for battle.

111
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Your Majesty, please raise the tent
and take a mass pledge.

112
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,600
When I get the Heavenly Queen back,

113
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,780
the wedding will go on.

114
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,540
Your Majesty, please be careful.

115
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,960
How did I fall asleep?

116
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,380
I,

117
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,540
I should hurry back to see how Floral Realm is.

118
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,600
Why do you dress like this?

119
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,780
You're up.

120
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,100
News to report.

121
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,520
My Lord,

122
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,660
the Heavenly Emperor has led millions of heavenly armies

123
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,500
and deployed them along the Wangchuan River.

124
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
The King of Bian City and Princess Liu Ying
have dispatched troops to fight them.

125
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
My Lord, please take over the reins.

126
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,300
Got it.

127
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,020
You can leave now.

128
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,740
Yes.

129
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,300
Phoenix,

130
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,440
Run Yu,

131
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,440
I don't know...I don't know why he did this.

132
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Please trust me, okay?

133
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,780
The Heavenly Emperor personally leads his soldiers

134
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,660
to save the Water Immortal held by the Demon Lord.

135
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,800
What an altisonant reason!

136
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,060
Today,

137
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,400
he tries to fight me to death.

138
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,400
I also want to see

139
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,680
how he will face me.

140
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,680
Don't go.

141
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,780
Phoenix.

142
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,560
Phoenix.

143
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,900
Halt the troops and wait.

144
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,400
When I pick up the Water Immortal,

145
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,400
you command the army to start attack.

146
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

147
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,980
Bro just removed half of his power yesterday,

148
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,900
and their armies arrive upon the border today.

149
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,500
Did they come after knowing it?

150
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,520
Fight with full force.

151
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:19,520
Demon Lord, Demon Lord...

152
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,520
Today, I don't want to fight,

153
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,520
I only want to pick up the Water Immortal.

154
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
She comes to Demon Realm at her own will,

155
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,300
we regard her as a distinguished guest.

156
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,080
We have no displeasure, and we don’t force her to stay.

157
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,560
Why do you gather so many forces here?

158
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,560
It will make those who don't know the truth

159
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,280
think that you're trying to pick up a fight.

160
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Mi,

161
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,520
come over here.

162
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,260
Your Majesty, I'm fine here.

163
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,640
You can rest assured.

164
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,560
Don't be impetuous!

165
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,240
I won't go back to Heavenly Realm with you.

166
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,580
Well, there is good news.

167
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,580
I think you should have also heard that.

168
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Last night,

169
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,200
I finished the wedding ceremony with the Water Immortal.

170
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,120
So now,

171
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,880
she is the queen of our Demon Realm.

172
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,060
We just get married and
stick together like glue and varnish.

173
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,460
How could she be willing to leave Demon Realm?

174
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Ridiculous!

175
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,140
I and the Water Immortal
have a marriage contract earlier.

176
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,740
People in the six realms all know it.

177
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,060
You've betrayed the Heavenly Realm
and fell into demon world.

178
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,820
How dare you hold the queen of the Heavenly Realm?

179
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,860
You really want to alienate
yourself from the world, don't you?

180
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,940
Let me advise you to turn around early,

181
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,760
and not make a fatal mistake.

182
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
I and Jin Mi see eye to eye with each other.

183
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,660
We're willing to become a couple.

184
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,480
We've gone through the wedding ceremony

185
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,180
and worshipped the heaven and earth and our parents.

186
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,860
Besides, both Demon Realm and
the Bird Family were present to witness it.

187
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,500
I don't think there's anything
inappropriate with the marriage.

188
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,860
Am I right, everyone?

189
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes, yes, yes.

190
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
Yes.

191
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,980
Do you have any good to provoke him?

192
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,900
If I don't do it first,

193
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,300
he will push us around.

194
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,320
In that case, I'm afraid there's
no such a good chance anymore.

195
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,480
The Heavenly Emperor has
sent a troop to destroy Floral Realm.

196
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,860
After all, you still don't trust me.

197
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,160
I don't trust him.

198
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,060
Bro, before our reinforcements arrive,

199
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,480
the Heavenly Emperor has controlled Floral Realm

200
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,260
and ordered to massacre Floral Realm.

201
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,900
As long Jin Mi doesn't return,

202
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
he'll kill a person in Floral Realm every day.

203
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,120
Your Majesty, why do you do this?

204
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,120
The Floral Realm has never offended you.

205
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,220
It was just a matter of expediency.

206
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,220
That’s to persuade you to go back early.

207
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,220
If you come back to me,

208
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,420
everything would be fine.

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,260
If I never let go of her,

210
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,020
what can you do to me?

211
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,440
If so,

212
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,700
I'll not leave any one alive today.

213
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,100
Don't do that.

214
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,720
The Heavenly Emperor is going to slaughter today,

215
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,840
and turn Floral Realm
and Wangchuan River into the Acheron.

216
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll fight to the end.

217
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,980
Go fight!

218
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,120
Fight , fight, fight...

219
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,240
Fight, fight, fight...

220
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,240
Fight, fight.

221
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Can you stop fighting?

222
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,300
Jin Mi,

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,420
the day will come sooner and later.

224
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,420
Protect the Water immortal.

225
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,180
Phoenix.

226
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,360
Stop fighting!

227
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,050
Over and over again,

228
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,020
you tried to kill me.

229
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,480
You've resorted to every conceivable means.

230
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,480
My being alive

231
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,340
makes you so scared?

232
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,650
You were reborn against nature
and fell into the demon world.

233
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,710
As the Heavenly Emperor,

234
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,710
I should obey the nature and eradicate the evil.

235
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,710
It's funny.

236
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
I never give in to the destiny.

237
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Today,

238
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,820
I shall have to reverse the destiny.

239
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,060
Stop fighting!

240
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,570
Stop, stop fighting!

241
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,140
Phoenix!

242
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,028
Phoenix, are you alright?

243
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,028
Let me see.

244
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,857
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

245
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,000
The countercharge got worse.

246
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,914
Let's call a truce, okay?

247
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:21,942
I beg you, Phoenix.

248
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,942
Stop fighting!

249
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:26,685
Stop fighting.

250
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,371
Phoenix!

251
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,457
To strive for victory, the awe-inspiring Heavenly Emperor

252
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:23,542
even breaks the rules and uses the forbidden technique.

253
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,542
That's ironic.

254
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,542
Being the prime demon,

255
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,542
how could you talk about fair and square with me?

256
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:33,200
All the land under the heaven is mine,

257
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:35,200
and the six realms will serve me.

258
00:30:35,942 --> 00:30:36,971
To treat you,

259
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,914
I'll just apply your own way.

260
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,171
She is a dying person

261
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:13,714
There is no difference to unlock the Garan Seal for her.

262
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:16,342
Living a life is not a mercy,

263
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,657
living hundred times is not a mercy, either.

264
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,314
Possessing universal compassion is a real mercy.

265
00:31:24,457 --> 00:31:27,142
In the mountain, there is a fierce tiger
that is dying due to being seriously wounded.

266
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:29,885
Will you save it or not?

267
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:34,685
If it's healed and returns to the mountain,
it will hunt the elks and eat the rabbits.

268
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:38,057
Though its life is saved, it hurts hundreds of other lives.

269
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,057
Being merciful in the wrong way

270
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:42,057
is actually pushing people into an abyss of misery.

271
00:31:42,571 --> 00:31:44,000
A mountain tiger...

272
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:45,485
Yes,

273
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,485
my life

274
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,571
was saved by fighting against nature.

275
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:53,485
I can neither be a soldier in the battlefield,

276
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:56,342
nor a general racking brains in scheming.

277
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:58,800
But I am considered

278
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,714
to be a reason to provoke war.

279
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:03,714
How ridiculous!

280
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:47,771
Jin Mi!

281
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:16,914
Jin Mi.

282
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:18,457
Jin Mi.

283
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,742
Jin Mi.

284
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,742
Stop fighting.

285
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:32,628
For the sake of me,

286
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,228
it's not worth doing it.

287
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:42,857
The entanglement is anyhow

288
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,057
a matter among the three of us,

289
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,342
and has nothing to do with anyone else.

290
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,971
Run Yu...

291
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Your love for me

293
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,314
won't be compensated

294
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:13,657
in my lifetime.

295
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:16,628
I hope

296
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:20,285
you can change back to the Fish Fairy in the past

297
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,085
and let go of old grudge.

298
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,200
Promise me.

299
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,114
Will you?

300
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,371
I promise you.

301
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,800
Phoenix.

302
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm here.

303
00:34:42,057 --> 00:34:43,200
I want,

304
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:46,628
I want to hear you say,

305
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:50,171
I want to hear you say

306
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,028
you already forgive me.

307
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:00,228
I never hated you.

308
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,257
From beginning to end,

309
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,600
the one I hate is myself.

310
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:08,000
I hate myself.

311
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,942
I finally heard you say that.

312
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,342
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

313
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:24,057
You're silly.

314
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:29,885
Fine, fine.

315
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,314
As a fruit,

316
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,685
I'll not argue with birds like you.

317
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:51,485
Phoenix, promise me.

318
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:53,714
Eat it

319
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,228
before the sunset of tomorrow.

320
00:35:57,542 --> 00:36:00,228
You should stay alive.

321
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:02,228
Will you?

322
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:09,885
Phoenix,

323
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:14,000
I love you.

324
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:23,085
I really want to go back to those days.

325
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,340
At that time,

326
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,685
I didn't know what love is,

327
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,600
but I stayed by your side every day.

328
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:33,600
That made me so happy.

329
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
At that time,

330
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I was your page boy,

331
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:39,371
and you

332
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,657
were that superior,

333
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,742
defiant and arrogant Phoenix.

334
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:46,742
While the Fish Fairy

335
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,942
was a gentle and kind boy.

336
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:53,314
And also

337
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,628
the Fox Immortal,

338
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,285
Lord Puchi

339
00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:58,285
dad,

340
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:00,285
and Aunty Lin Xiu.

341
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,971
How good it was!

342
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,171
But it will never be the same again.

343
00:37:17,714 --> 00:37:22,342
Love bears worry, and love creates fear.

344
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:28,114
If leaving the love, you'll have neither worry nor fear.

345
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:34,800
If there is love in your heart,

346
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,371
how will you be afraid of worry and fear?

347
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,228
Jin Mi.

348
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,228
In the rest of my lifetime,

349
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,428
I'll never step into Demon Realm again.

350
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,142
Here shall be the boundary.
