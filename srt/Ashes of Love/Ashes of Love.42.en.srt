00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 42"

3
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,620
Dad

4
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,060
Mi.

5
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Here. Drink it when it is hot.

6
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,580
OK.

7
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,340
Eat some sugar to get rid of the bitter taste.

8
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,000
Mi.

9
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,660
Don’t let me worry about you anymore.

10
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,720
You get injured almost every day.

11
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,840
Sui He closely resembles her Auntie.

12
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,860
I must report it to His Majesty.

13
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,340
Sui He likes Phoenix,

14
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,680
so it’s reasonable for her to hate me.

15
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,500
Who do you

16
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,260
like?

17
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,440
To tell the truth, I don’t know either.

18
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
I always feel empty

19
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,280
and don’t know why.

20
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,820
Dad,

21
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,820
what should I do?

22
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,920
I know you’re thoughtful

23
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,060
and unwilling to put me and others
in an awkward situation.

24
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,500
I also wanted to

25
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,820
make a correct decision for you before,

26
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,380
but what happened recently

27
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,220
reminds me of your mother

28
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,700
and the past events.

29
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,360
I finally understand why

30
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,980
Zi Fen hid your identity

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,980
and hid you in the Water Mirror.

32
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,540
Now

33
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,320
you do suffer a lot due to love.

34
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,840
I won’t get married

35
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,200
and will stay with you all my life.

36
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,640
Then I have no worries.

37
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,180
Silly girl,

38
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,060
it’s useless to avoid it.

39
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,040
Now you’re by my side.

40
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,780
You can choose boldly.

41
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,120
No matter whom you choose,
Fire Immortal or Night Immortal,

42
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,960
I’ll support you

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,580
as long as you really feel happy.

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
Thank you, Dad.

45
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,940
Here you are.

46
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,880
Lin Xiu.

47
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,660
Luo Lin.

48
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,440
How is it possible?

49
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,880
Immortal.

50
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,500
Immortal.

51
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
What happened?

52
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,840
Fire…

53
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,100
Fire…

54
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
What?

55
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,480
Dad.

56
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,680
Dad.

57
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,800
Jin Mi.

58
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,880
Dad.

59
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Jin Mi.

60
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,300
Auntie Lin Xiu.

61
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,380
Dad.

62
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,420
Dad.

63
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,560
Dad.

64
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
Dad, what happened?

65
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:34,980
Dad.

66
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,720
Dad.

67
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,340
Dad, say something. Dad.

68
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
Jin Mi, listen to me.

69
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,560
Auntie Lin Xiu.

70
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,960
Auntie Lin Xiu.

71
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,480
What happened to them?

72
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,460
Dad.

73
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,020
Dad. Jin Mi.

74
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,020
Dad.

75
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,660
Dad.

76
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,780
Dad.

77
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,640
Auntie Lin Xiu.

78
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,220
Dad.

79
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,500
Where are you going?

80
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,320
Jin Mi.

81
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,460
Dad, where are you going?

82
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,060
Jin Mi.

83
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,400
I’m begging you, Phoenix.

84
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,200
I beg you.

85
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,040
I beg you to save them, OK?

86
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,140
I know. I know.

87
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,980
Dad.

88
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,660
Jin Mi. Listen to me, Jin Mi.

89
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,180
I beg you to save them.

90
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Listen to me, Jin Mi.

91
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,300
Dad. Jin Mi.

92
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
I can’t.

93
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,240
It’s too late.

94
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
Jin Mi.

95
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,840
Jin Mi.

96
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,360
Jin Mi.

97
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,560
Jin Mi.

98
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,940
Mi.

99
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,160
Thank you, Dad.

100
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,480
This is so bitter.

101
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,020
Good medicine is bitter.

102
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,700
Here.

103
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,060
Eat some sugar to get rid of the bitter taste.

104
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,400
Thank you, Dad.

105
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Dad.

106
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,180
Dad.

107
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,000
Mi.

108
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,880
I just,

109
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,560
I just dreamed of Dad.

110
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,320
Mi,

111
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,600
if you want to cry, just cry.

112
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,380
They two were killed by someone unknown.

113
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,140
You must pick yourself up

114
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,560
to find out the truth.

115
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,540
Jin Mi,

116
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,200
no matter what happens,

117
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,740
I’ll always be with you.

118
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,480
Mi is my future wife.

119
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,123
I’m here.

120
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:41,458
Why bother you?

121
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,320
You don’t have to provide timely help now.

122
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,320
She’s so miserable now.

123
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,120
Do you have to vie with me
to see who is better now?

124
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
I beg you.

125
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,520
Get out.

126
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,040
Jin Mi.

127
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,520
I beg you.

128
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,660
I beg you to get out.

129
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,163
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

130
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,417
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

131
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,628
<i>The flower in my heart has withered. </i>

132
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,298
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

133
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,580
<i>I hope to wash away…</i>

134
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
Dad.

135
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,140
Dad.

136
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,300
If you didn’t pour

137
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,860
half of your cultivation

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,400
into this ice knife

139
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,100
to protect me,

140
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,820
you wouldn’t…

141
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,040
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

142
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,660
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

143
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,220
<i>The memory haunts me,</i>

144
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,420
<i>making me grieved.</i>

145
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,360
<i>Hope I won’t feel regret in the rest of my life.</i>

146
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,840
<i>Fly away with the fragrance of the flowers.</i>

147
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,440
<i>A pot of clear wine</i>

148
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,100
<i>and the dust on me.</i>

149
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,280
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

150
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,940
Dad.

151
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
Auntie Lin Xiu.

152
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,340
Sorry.

153
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,240
I’ll find out who did it

154
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,740
and avenge your death.

155
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,820
After Water Immortal passed away,

156
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,780
the whole world

157
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,900
was sad and cried for him.

158
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,920
He was kind-hearted

159
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,820
and had sympathy for all things on earth,

160
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,320
so he helped countless people
with his magic power all his life.

161
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,320
I want to confer a posthumous title
of Kindness Immortal on him.

162
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,560
Immortal Jin Mi is the only
daughter of Water Immortal

163
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,973
and should observe mourning for three years by law.

164
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,660
Therefore, the wedding day of
Jin Mi and Night Immortal Run Yu

165
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,820
is extended to three years later after the mourning.

166
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,620
Besides, Immortal Jin Mi succeeds as Water Immortal

167
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
from today on.

168
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,880
I accept the decree.

169
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,060
Stand up.

170
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,860
Jin Mi,

171
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,480
restrain your grief.

172
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,440
I promise you

173
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,900
I’ll find out who killed Water Immortal.

174
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,220
You don’t need to worry about it.

175
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
I’ll find out

176
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,340
who killed Mister Immortal for Mi.

177
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,840
Jin Mi,

178
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,760
I’m deeply sorry to hear that.

179
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,640
Chief Peony,

180
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,580
I have become what I used to be again.

181
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,200
It’s said that

182
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,840
a shadow doesn’t flow along with the running water

183
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,140
and the water always flows to the east
while the shadow still remains.

184
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,160
How come no water disappears,

185
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,060
but dad is gone?

186
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,500
Father,

187
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,140
greetings.

188
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,540
Water Immortal

189
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,960
used to talk about virtue and morality.

190
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,360
I always laughed at him and said he was childish,

191
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,500
but I respected him a lot,

192
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,300
because he could practice

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,240
what he preached

194
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,240
and dared to tell me the truth.

195
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,040
But now he passed away.

196
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,900
Are you also here to investigate into
the case of Water Immortal?

197
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,280
Yes.

198
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,380
You want to find the murderer for Jin Mi.

199
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,900
Jin Mi is my future wife.

200
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,460
It’s my duty to find out the real murderer

201
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,580
who killed her father for her.

202
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,320
The file presented by the Chief of Pixiang Hall

203
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,420
only says that

204
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,360
Water Immortal died of Glazed Pure Fire.

205
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,160
There is no other clue.

206
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,300
How do you think?

207
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,000
There are only two persons

208
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,820
who have high cultivation

209
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,980
and can control Glazed Pure Fire in the six realms.

210
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,480
Mother is detained in Pisuo Jail now.

211
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,840
The other one…

212
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,360
The other one is Xu Feng.

213
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,900
What’s more, he happened to be
Luoxiang Mansion that day.

214
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
It seems so

215
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,020
on the surface.

216
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,140
On the surface?

217
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,660
He was there.

218
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,960
Grass seal script.

219
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,220
Glazed Pure Fire.

220
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
All points to Xu Feng.

221
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,440
But I think

222
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,660
this is too direct.

223
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,480
You don’t think it was done by Xu Feng?

224
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,780
I believe

225
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,020
my brother knows what he should do
and what he shouldn’t do.

226
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,140
Who do you think is the murderer?

227
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,160
The key is that I know well
that Xu Feng isn’t the murderer,

228
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,320
but I don’t know who did it.

229
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,100
Water Immortal enjoyed high prestige
and universal respect

230
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,540
in the Heaven Realm

231
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,380
and had no enemy.

232
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,220
Moreover, you have read the file

233
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,020
and found no clue.

234
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,280
I’m afraid it is very difficult to find out

235
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,860
the real murderer of this case.

236
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,580
But if the file is made public,

237
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
other immortals may not see it like you did.

238
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,920
Exactly.

239
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,300
I know

240
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,500
you place great hopes on Xu Feng

241
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,740
and his reputation can’t be ruined.

242
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,840
I advice you

243
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,540
to seal the file

244
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,180
and not to make it public

245
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,060
before the real murderer

246
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,420
is found.

247
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,580
Yu,

248
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,560
I also place great hopes on you.

249
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,880
I’ll share burdens of you and my brother.

250
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Yu,

251
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,320
sometimes

252
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,280
you’re so considerate.

253
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
Xu Feng needs to avert suspicion.

254
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,500
The matter is entirely in your hands.

255
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,380
Do as you said.

256
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,820
Yes, Father.

257
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,781
"Sweet Spring"

258
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,020
I don’t know why

259
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,769
I feel cool and close

260
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,900
when seeing Water Immortal.

261
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,700
Jin Mi is the daughter of me and Zi Fen.

262
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,140
I won’t abandon you and let you live lonely

263
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,280
in the future again.

264
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,220
You may be thrown out if any higher.

265
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,720
I’m not afraid of it.

266
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,460
If I am thrown out, Dad will protect me.

267
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,260
Impossible.

268
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,220
It can’t be him.

269
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,240
It can’t be him.

270
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,320
Impossible.

271
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,140
Your Highness Fire Immortal,

272
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,580
Jin Mi is always close to you.

273
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,700
Comfort her.

274
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,280
Jin Mi.

275
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,940
May I worship

276
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,640
the two late immortals?

277
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,600
I’ll bring the real murderer to justice

278
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,560
for the two late immortals.

279
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,500
How is everything going?

280
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,860
I have found nothing yet.

281
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,900
It’s strange that

282
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,540
I can’t find any trace on the spot

283
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,520
where they were murdered.

284
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,020
Dad and Auntie Lin Xiu were kind-hearted

285
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,360
and stood aloof from the worldly affairs

286
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,320
before their death.

287
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,380
Why did they die so distressingly?

288
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,120
This is all my fault.

289
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,180
This is not your fault.

290
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,500
Don’t blame yourself.

291
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,160
Let me ask you a question.

292
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,320
Who can freely control

293
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,260
Glazed Pure Fire

294
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,000
in the six realms?

295
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,080
Glazed Pure Fire

296
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,320
is the supreme level of
the Phoenix Bird Family’s magic.

297
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,120
As far as I know, except Mother and me,

298
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,340
no one in the six realms

299
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,180
has really mastered it in thousands of years.

300
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,340
Why do you suddenly ask about that?

301
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,440
Let me ask you another question.

302
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,580
Who can kill Dad and Auntie Lin Xiu

303
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,900
one after another

304
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,760
in the six realms?

305
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,120
Did you find anything?

306
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,180
If you did, you should tell me as soon as possible.

307
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,720
This letter

308
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,320
was found by me when I
cleared up the remains of Dad.

309
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,780
How do you explain it?

310
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,600
Grass seal script.

311
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,280
I hope to meet Mister Immortal

312
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
in the courtyard in the midnight hour today.

313
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,440
It’s about Jin Mi. I’m looking forward to you.

314
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,820
Is there anyone

315
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,620
who uses grass seal script except you?

316
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,000
Do you suspect me?

317
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
This letter isn’t written by me.

318
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,560
It is clear that someone framed me.

319
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,220
Tell me

320
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,260
why you were on the spot

321
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,000
when Dad was murdered.

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,260
Someone of Luoxiang Mansion said

323
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,500
Water Immortal

324
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,040
asked me to come to
Luoxiang Mansion for a chat. I…

325
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,580
We were trapped.

326
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,120
Trapped?

327
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,540
You don’t believe me?

328
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,140
When my dad was dying,

329
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,900
his clothes were burned white.

330
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,960
Answer me.

331
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
What kind of fire

332
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,520
could burn his clothes in that way?

333
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,720
Glazed Pure Fire.

334
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,580
Exactly.

335
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,060
It’s Glazed Pure Fire.

336
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,340
Just as you said,

337
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,460
in six realms,

338
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,320
only you and Heavenly Empress
can use Glazed Pure Fire.

339
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,360
But now Heavenly Empress is imprisoned,

340
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,000
and only you

341
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
can use Glazed Pure Fire.

342
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,880
It’s you.

343
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,960
You killed my dad.

344
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,400
We’ve been together for many years,

345
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,160
but you don’t know me?

346
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,380
Wind Immortal and Water Immortal
are your families.

347
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,280
How could I kill them?

348
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,240
Even if I killed them,

349
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,660
I wouldn’t be so foolish

350
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,420
to leave a letter to keep you suspect.

351
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,480
Think about it.

352
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,660
Now I can’t prove my innocence.

353
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,660
If you really think

354
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,580
I killed them,

355
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,780
just kill me.

356
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,640
I don’t want to kill you.

357
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,380
I just want my dad to be alive.

358
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,180
I just want my dad to be alive.

359
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,240
Jin Mi.

360
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Give me some time.

361
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,700
I must bring the murder to you.

362
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,840
Trust me.

363
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,300
Dad.

364
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,660
I just want my dad.

365
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,540
I just want my dad.

366
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,380
I just want my dad to be still alive.

367
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,240
I just want my dad to be still alive.

368
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,940
Dad, Dad.

369
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,400
Dad, don’t go.

370
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,740
Dad, don’t leave me.

371
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,620
Dad.

372
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Dad.

373
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,600
Phoenix.

374
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,960
Please, don’t kill my dad.

375
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,020
Dad, don’t leave me.

376
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,680
Dad.

377
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,920
Dad.

378
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,760
Phoenix.

379
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,420
Please.

380
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,380
Please.

381
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,740
Dad.

382
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,140
Phoenix, don’t kill my dad.

383
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,640
The First Prince set new rules that

384
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,360
since the last month,

385
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,500
besides the Eight-Direction Heaven Troops,

386
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,740
other immortals and lords

387
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
can’t investigate the military files casually.

388
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,880
His Majesty agreed to it.

389
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,060
Your Highness,

390
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,080
will it be possible for the
First Prince to be the murder?

391
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,680
Impossible!

392
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,820
He is my elder brother.

393
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
Even if there is some misunderstand between us,

394
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,240
he won’t hurt me like this.

395
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,640
Yes. I’ve lost my head.

396
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,600
The First Prince is just

397
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,540
and appraised widely in the Heaven Realm.

398
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,040
He won’t do this.

399
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,040
He is just and appraised widely.

400
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
That’s true.

401
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,520
Run Yu only knows water magic,

402
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,800
so he won’t use Glazed Pure Fire.

403
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,060
In addition, Water Immortal was Run Yu’s backer.

404
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,140
Run Yu is clear.

405
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,320
He wouldn’t kill Water Immortal

406
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,220
to frame me.

407
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
Mother.

408
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,700
Xu.

409
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Xu.

410
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,120
My son. You finally come to see me.

411
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,560
Father stops me seeing you.

412
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,360
How come you are like this?

413
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,580
If Heavenly Emperor stops you coming here,

414
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,080
don’t come here again.

415
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,160
Don’t irritate him again.

416
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Mother, I’m fine.

417
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,820
Once you become the Heavenly Emperor,

418
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,240
I will be released for sure.

419
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,880
Mother.

420
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,660
If that position is mine, it will be mine.

421
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,120
If it’s not mine,
it will be useless for me to strive for it.

422
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,320
Silly boy, you must strive for it.

423
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,240
Mother.

424
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,340
Did you ever fight against Water Immortal?

425
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,060
What’s wrong with him?

426
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,320
He and Wind Immortal were killed.

427
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,660
Did this have something to do with you?

428
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
That’s great.

429
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,300
You did this?

430
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,880
It doesn’t matter who killed them.

431
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,600
Now Run Yu has lost his advantages,

432
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,980
he won’t shake your standing
for the Heavenly Emperor

433
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,580
even if he married Jin Mi.

434
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,700
You’d better think about how to
follow up the victory with hot pursuit.

435
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,700
Even the prison can’t keep your ambition.

436
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,460
You thought you did these for me.

437
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,580
But you just put me in an immoral situation.

438
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,480
Xu Feng.

439
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,100
How can you say this?

440
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,500
Those who want to have great cause
won’t stick to the trifles.

441
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,340
If you want to be Heavenly Emperor,

442
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,480
you can’t be merciful.

443
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Mother,

444
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,740
you gave birth to me.

445
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
But you don’t know me at all.

446
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,040
Son,

447
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,700
I know you too much.

448
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,920
You are simple-minded and merciful.

449
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
I will do what

450
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,680
you don’t want to do.

451
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,200
You are not as shrewd as Run Yu.

452
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,040
He might trap you one day instead.

453
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,640
We are brothers after all.

454
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,620
He won't hurt me.

455
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,000
Your deed will just lead him to a blind alley,

456
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,740
You must be crueler than him.

457
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,000
You must be crueler than others

458
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,680
to convince all people.

459
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,320
Xu Feng, for the sake of me,

460
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,580
you must be the Heavenly Emperor.

461
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,060
Now Water Immortal has been dead,

462
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,020
it’s the golden chance to kill Run Yu.

463
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,780
As long as you marry Sui He,

464
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,200
the Birds’ Family will be your backer.

465
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,720
I won’t marry her.

466
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,000
Silly boy.

467
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,540
How can’t you see the situation through?

468
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,580
If you stick to Jin Mi,

469
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,720
you will regret.

470
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
I just want to see

471
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,080
whether I can live well

472
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,860
without following your words.

473
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,620
Forgive me for disobedience.

474
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,440
Xu Feng.

475
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,780
You must be the Heavenly Emperor.

476
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,760
This is my only wish.

477
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,220
I can die for you.

478
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,160
The sheep has the feeling of filial piety,

479
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,520
the crow has returns nurturing
to parents righteousness.

480
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,100
Even if animals are grateful,

481
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,300
let alone Immortals.

482
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,400
Sacrificing mother for strength

483
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,640
is cruel and unfilial.

484
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,160
Such a ungrateful and fierce one
is the same as a brute.

485
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,820
I can’t do this.

486
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,580
Even if I’m misunderstood by others,

487
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,200
I won’t be the filial son

488
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,820
you want.

489
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,420
Xu Feng.

490
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,140
Xu Feng.

491
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,240
Xu Feng.

492
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,740
Xu Feng.

493
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Take it easy.

494
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
For beginner,

495
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,740
you have done very well.

496
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,800
You have heavy affairs,

497
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,940
I want to learn it as early as possible

498
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,800
to share your burden.

499
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,140
More haste, less speed.

500
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:35,982
Take it easy.

501
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,108
Do it slowly.

502
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,320
With your talent,

503
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,760
I believe you will manage it soon.

504
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,560
Your Highness,

505
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,160
Can we arrange Three Stars mansion?

506
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,327
The Heart mansion hasn’t fell.

507
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:49,787
It’s not the right time.

508
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,680
How many dreams did you eat?

509
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,540
Are you stuffed?

510
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,560
Get Three Stars mansion up.

511
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:37,666
Yes.

512
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,640
Remember.

513
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,964
People can’t always meet

514
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:46,675
like the Three Stars mansion
and the Heart mansion.

515
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,920
Dad.
