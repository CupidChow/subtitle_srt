1
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:15,282
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:18,124
"Episode 9"

3
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,250
If Chief Peony wants
to punish someone,...

4
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:21,962
then punish me.

5
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:23,586
No one can interfere with...

6
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,457
Floral Realm's matters.

7
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:28,545
I hope Fire Immortal
will not interfere.

8
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:30,776
I will not be bothered
about other immortals.

9
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:33,033
As long as it concerns the
fairies of Floral Realm,...

10
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:35,233
Even though you are very powerful,

11
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,169
don't you wish to
meddle in our affairs.

12
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,903
I understand.

13
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,556
I have a clear conscience
that I've never misconducted.

14
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,928
I hope Chief Peony won't
believe in the rumours.

15
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,746
I've really...

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,253
fallen for Fairy Jin Mi.

17
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,241
You!

18
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,608
Your Highness.

19
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
I will bring Jin Mi back.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
Don't think you can bring her.

21
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,793
Let's not meet again in the future.

22
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,877
Chief Peony may have
misunderstood Heaven...

23
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,085
Realm and me.

24
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,295
I will come to visit again next time.

25
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,749
I hope can clear this
misunderstanding by then.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,709
I hope Chief Peony will
understand my sincerity.

27
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,399
When is that?

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,047
Will you thank me too?

29
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:31,356
Jin Mi.

30
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,753
Jin Mi.

31
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,003
I must thank you sincerely.

32
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,600
I still owe you 1000 years
worth of magical prowess.

33
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,966
Don't worry, I haven't forget.

34
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:41,649
You don't need to trouble yourself.

35
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:43,373
Next time,...

36
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,712
I won't let you see Jin Mi.

37
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,230
I still owe you 1000 years
worth of magical prowess.

38
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:57,756
Don't worry.

39
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,503
I haven't forgotten.

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,411
Kneel down.

41
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,295
Floral Immortal passed away
but she will still know.

42
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:16,658
Today, in front of Floral Immortal,

43
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:19,670
answer my questions honestly.

44
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:21,663
Towards Floral Immortal,

45
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,669
I'll answer truthfully.

46
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,963
Where is your Prowess
Suppress Hairpin?

47
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,811
I have kept it.

48
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,378
Other than Fire Immortal,

49
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,877
who else has seen your true form?

50
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,745
There are Moon Immortal and Liao Ting.

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,350
Fei Xu, Sui He, Liu Ying.

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,460
So many people.

53
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,825
So many mouths to shut, it's
impossible to kill all.

54
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,420
It's still better to have prevention.

55
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,846
Is Fire Immortal the one who brought
you away from the Water Mirror?

56
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,631
Yes.

57
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55,552
Then did you stay in Qiwu Palace...

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,511
after you left the Water Mirror?

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes.

60
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:01,154
Were you the one who plant
Night Rattan?

61
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
Yes.

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,376
Another question.

63
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,038
Do you have feelings towards...

64
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,420
Fire Immortal?

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,799
Yes.

66
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,402
Oh, this is all wrong.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,250
Floral Immortal, I'm not
worthy of your trust.

68
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,620
I'll destroy half of my
prowess as punishment.

69
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,212
Chief Peony, what are you doing?

70
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,781
I said wrongly.

71
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,896
Then tell me, was that true?

72
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,670
We are friends.

73
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,321
I didn't fall in love with him.

74
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:35,695
You asked me in a hurry.

75
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,295
I couldn't respond properly.

76
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,503
Then why do you repeatedly
violate the rules?

77
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,217
And work hard to save his life?

78
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,548
And about the invitation
before he left.

79
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,800
What do all these mean?

80
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,366
He saved me before, so I
want to save him too.

81
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:47,874
This is to return the favour.

82
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,228
Furthermore, he promised...

83
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,849
to give me 1000 years
worth of prowess.

84
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,204
He hasn't given to me yet.

85
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:56,712
Is it really because of the prowess?

86
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,253
Of course.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,331
Don't hurt me!

88
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:10,319
The Yun Elixir is still there.

89
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:14,378
Fine, I expected too much from you.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,880
You must remember...

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,682
Heaven Realm and Floral Realm
have huge grudge.

92
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,385
Today, in front of the tomb of Floral Immortal,

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,353
swear that...

94
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:26,961
you won't have anything to do
with Heaven Realm anymore.

95
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:30,634
To Floral Immortal,...

96
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,172
I, Jin Mi, swear that...

97
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,347
I won't have anything to do with...

98
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:38,110
the people of Heaven Realm.

99
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:41,243
If I break this promise,
my prowess will be gone.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,986
I won't be able to achieve
immortality this lifetime.

101
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,313
I'll become a mortal next lifetime.

102
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:49,899
And for the next,

103
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,533
I'll become a carrot...

104
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,670
and is eaten by a rabbit.

105
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:55,698
That's enough for today.

106
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,128
Return with me.

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,057
Thank you, Chief Peony.

108
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,169
Floral Immortal,...

109
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,978
I only said that I
won't have anything...

110
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,376
to do with the people of Heaven Realm.

111
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:14,044
But Phoenix, Fish Fairy
and Moon Immortal...

112
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,360
are immortals and not normal people.

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,665
So they are not considered
in the promise.

114
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:21,572
May Floral Immortal forgive me.

115
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,712
Are you still upset with Jin Mi?

116
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,415
I'm upset with myself.

117
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,793
Why didn't I take good care of Jin Mi?

118
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,877
She is thus able to mix with
those from Heaven Realm.

119
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:52,128
That's a sin.

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,637
This is not your fault.

121
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,335
This is...

122
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:59,628
fate.

123
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:00,919
Fate?

124
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,684
Why must fate fool people?

125
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Floral Immortal lost her life.

126
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:11,629
Why fate must interfere
with Jin Mi's life?

127
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:13,194
No, don't think like that.

128
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:14,587
It's not like that.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,304
Little One has...

130
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,836
eaten Yun Elixir.

131
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,629
She won't fall in love.

132
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:23,670
So she won't be hurt
by love, isn't it?

133
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,419
She won't end up like Floral Immortal.

134
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,149
Furthermore, you take
good care of her.

135
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,035
She will be happy her whole life.

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,640
I hope so.

137
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,943
I hope she understands
what I'm doing for her.

138
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,336
She will.

139
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,098
Maybe...

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,225
if you are not so strict...

141
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,756
and change your way,

142
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,598
be more gentle when guiding her,

143
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:54,208
she will understand you're
trying to help her.

144
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,031
Do you mean that I'm too stern?

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,269
No, I don't mean it.

146
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,564
Look,

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in the whole of Floral Realm,

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,195
who is comparable to you?

149
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,501
You're stern and cute.

150
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:15,215
And is respectable.

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,360
Friendly...

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,057
and cute.

153
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,586
Chief Peony said that everyone
from Heaven Realm are bad.

154
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,628
She won't lie to us.

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,021
I think...

156
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,447
he uses prowess as a bait.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,011
So you will help and save him.

158
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,712
No, we have promised each other.

159
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,852
He will come today.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,930
He will give me 1000
years worth of prowess.

161
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,998
I don't think he will come.

162
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,446
No, he will keep his promise.

163
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,311
He will come here as he said.

164
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:50,599
Should we bet?

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Fine, 10 years worth of
prowess, are you brave enough?

166
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:24,163
Greetings, Chiefs.

167
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,253
The Phoenix actually comes here.

168
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,461
I told you he will.

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,006
Forget it then.

170
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,458
Since I have 1000 years
worth of prowess,

171
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,079
you can keep your 10
years worth of prowess.

172
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:41,295
There was no witness.

173
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:44,712
Why do you come to
Floral Realm's...

174
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,169
forbidden place?

175
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,461
I have promised Jin Mi
that I will come.

176
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,638
I will keep my promise.

177
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:54,387
After all, Jin Mi is someone I love.

178
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,595
Even if it is dangerous,
I will still come.

179
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,128
I hope all of you will...

180
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,580
allow me to meet her.

181
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,169
Ridiculous, it's a sin!

182
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,128
What does he mean?

183
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,980
He means...

184
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,046
Do you like me?

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,252
I like you.

186
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,564
So he means,

187
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:20,018
he likes me as his friend.

188
00:11:20,284 --> 00:11:22,493
He likes to be my friend.

189
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,202
Then why is Chief Magnolia upset?

190
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,759
It is just a friendship.

191
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,919
There are so many women out there.

192
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:34,850
Why won't Heaven Realm let
Floral Realm be?

193
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,961
What's more when it's Jin Mi.

194
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,461
I hope you stop your wistful thinking.

195
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,996
What's more when it involves Jin Mi?

196
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:44,800
I only know that...

197
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:47,553
Jin Mi is a fruit fairy who has been
training for a few thousand years.

198
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,138
According to what you said,

199
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,804
may I know...

200
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:53,332
why Jin Mi is the exceptional
case as stated earlier?

201
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,793
Not all things in the world...

202
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,849
can be known by Fire Immortal.

203
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,021
I sincerely advise you...

204
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,440
to not be fooled by Jin Mi's
appearance.

205
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,573
At the end of the day,
you'll be heartbroken.

206
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,712
And the one heartbroken will be you.

207
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,833
I'm not someone who judges
people by the appearance.

208
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,567
I...

209
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:15,897
loves Jin Mi...

210
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,002
because I like her naivety.

211
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:22,983
It really has nothing to do
with her looks.

212
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,509
All of you from Heaven Realm...

213
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,250
are really cold hearted.

214
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:30,308
Do you know that
millions of years ago,

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,225
an immortal also said
the same words here.

216
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,978
But in the end, it's meaningless.

217
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,784
The sentimentality is useless.

218
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,476
Once you wake up from the dream,

219
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,628
everything is a lie.

220
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,749
I don't know why both realms...

221
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,151
are still holding grudges
against each other.

222
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,818
But the past is in the past.

223
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,711
It's not right to affect
the next generations.

224
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,226
I hope you will...

225
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,986
let me know what had happened.

226
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,664
It may be a misunderstanding.

227
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,836
If you have free time,
don't waste your time in Floral Realm.

228
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,434
Why don't you ask...

229
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,336
your Heavenly Emperor?

230
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,629
We will only say this.

231
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,067
A reminder,

232
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,366
you can have any of the
women in the world.

233
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,312
But definitely not Jin Mi.

234
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:21,836
Father, hug me! Father, hug me!

235
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:23,044
Hug me please.

236
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:26,086
Father, hug me!

237
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,128
Father, the late Floral Immortal.

238
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,893
There are things best left unspoken.

239
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,468
Please return.

240
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,858
Are they playing the guessing game
or using a secret language?

241
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,465
I don't understand at all.

242
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,407
Me too.

243
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:07,461
Phoenix!

244
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:13,425
Where are you going?

245
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,334
He said he wanted to give me 1000
years worth of magical prowess.

246
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:16,584
If he leaves, who will
give me that prowess?

247
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,273
You will be scolded by
Chief Peony if she knows.

248
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,875
It's alright. I'll
come back immediately.

249
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,877
Jin Mi. Jin Mi!

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,765
Phoenix!

251
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,563
Phoenix!

252
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,058
Phoenix!

253
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:38,793
Phoenix, why are you ignoring me?

254
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,308
Phoenix!

255
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:02,865
You...

256
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,929
Why are you ignoring me?

257
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,811
Are you not going to give me 1000
years worth of magical prowess?

258
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,128
You break your promise.

259
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,503
Jin Mi, is that you?

260
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:24,474
If it's not me, who will it be?

261
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,362
You must be under a camouflage spell.

262
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,670
So I can't see you.

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,290
I see.

264
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,513
No wonder you can't see me.

265
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,894
You told me before.

266
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,608
Phoenix Flower only
blooms in two seasons.

267
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,031
One season for when destiny begins,
the other for when destiny ends.

268
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,044
Today,

269
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:57,753
I finally understand the saying,
we are are close yet so far apart.

270
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,086
You're standing in front of me.

271
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,836
But I can't see you.

272
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:09,461
Even if I see you,

273
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:13,979
I can only pretend to not seeing you.

274
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:18,324
It's better that we don't
see each other anymore.

275
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,917
What do you mean?

276
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,392
Are you frightened by Chief Peony?

277
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:30,169
All destinies will cease to an end.

278
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,253
All flowers will wilt in the end.

279
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,650
Maybe all these...

280
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:43,867
have been fated.

281
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:48,420
No one can rebel against it.

282
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:52,295
When I'm not around,

283
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,628
take good care of yourself.

284
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,545
Jin Mi,

285
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:11,378
take care.

286
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,755
<i>Do not wish to interfere the affairs.</i>

287
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,080
What are you saying?

288
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,115
Can you please explain clearly?

289
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:28,586
Phoenix.

290
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Phoenix!

291
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,420
Lord Fire Immortal.

292
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:42,724
May I know why...

293
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,927
you are still here at Floral Realm?

294
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:48,961
Chief Peony.

295
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:52,574
See you, Lord Fire Immortal.

296
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,961
Good bye.

297
00:17:56,793 --> 00:18:02,836
<i>Coming back and forth,
I have no regret.</i>

298
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:10,628
<i>The memory of life and death
has damaged the heart.</i>

299
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:17,461
<i>Returning to taste the aftertaste
of the wine.</i>

300
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:24,670
<i>Wish the moments in this life
will not fade.</i>

301
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,329
<i>Lose myself before the flower blooms.</i>

302
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:38,919
<i>Wish the moments in this life
will not fade.</i>

303
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,659
<i>Returning to taste the aftertaste
of the wine.</i>

304
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,527
<i>A bottle of wine, a body full of dust.</i>

305
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:59,295
<i>Coming back and forth,
I have no regret.</i>

306
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,707
Jin Mi, Jin Mi!

307
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,108
<i>Life and death have damaged the heart.</i>

308
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:13,961
<i>Returning to taste the aftertaste
of the wine.</i>

309
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:05,589
Who are you?

310
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,611
I'm Jin Mi, what's your name?

311
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,499
I'm Frost Blossom.

312
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,737
Frost Blossom?

313
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:36,128
Jin Mi, can you help me out?

314
00:20:37,793 --> 00:20:39,063
Do you want to come out?

315
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:40,946
I love someone.

316
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,812
I want to tell him.

317
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,760
She is the lovestruck woman
in Fox Fairy's story.

318
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:49,461
This is an interesting dream.
I'll help her.

319
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:51,336
Alright, wait for a while.

320
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,820
Jin Mi, Jin Mi!

321
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:14,457
Chief Peony.

322
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:16,197
Here.

323
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,919
Are you alright, Jin Mi?

324
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:24,501
Yes.

325
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,503
I don't know why but just now...

326
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,833
it hurts here.

327
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:32,420
Maybe I have eaten bad food.

328
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,063
You only create trouble every day.

329
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:40,461
This time, you need to
reflect on your wrongdoings.

330
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,753
Without my permission,

331
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:43,651
you cannot leave this compound.

332
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,673
I am sorry.

333
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:48,860
I will listen to you from now onwards.

334
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,725
Good.

335
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,954
All I'm doing is for your own good.

336
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:06,782
So strange.

337
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:08,836
Why does my heart hurt so badly?

338
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,815
And what does my dream mean?

339
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,190
- What are you doing?
- You're a woman!

340
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,498
Don't you know that man
and woman are different?

341
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,958
What do you mean?

342
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,760
Such behaviour is not allowed!

343
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:34,712
Rou Rou, Phoenix...

344
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,336
is temperamental...

345
00:22:38,794 --> 00:22:40,396
and arrogant,

346
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,793
but,

347
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,717
his heart is kind.

348
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,942
He treats me well.

349
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,080
But he is chased away.

350
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,659
I'm now left alone.

351
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,003
Paying respect to father.

352
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:09,834
Both of you must be tired.

353
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:10,939
Run Yu, Xu Feng,

354
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:13,321
hurry and stand.

355
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,497
Thank you, father.

356
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:21,197
Father, Qiong Qi commits evil actions.

357
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,111
To prevent him from
attacking the six realms,

358
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,843
I hope you can personally...

359
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,336
sentence Qiong Qi to death.

360
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,826
I agree.

361
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:32,793
Qiong Qi commits many evil actions.

362
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,559
His spirit should be killed.

363
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,177
As he is...

364
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,948
born from the ancient world's...

365
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,483
yin and yang earthy
and heavenly energy,

366
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,245
his death...

367
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,383
is not among the 5 elements.

368
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:48,628
Both of you have achieved success.

369
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,003
Don't worry about this.

370
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,712
I have my own plan.

371
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,810
We obey your words.

372
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,545
Xu Feng,

373
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:14,549
I heard from Immortal Qi Huang...

374
00:24:14,794 --> 00:24:17,545
that you were hurt by plague needle.

375
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,554
I was not careful.

376
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,231
So Qiong Qi was able to hurt me.

377
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,333
Thanks to Night Immortal
and Princess of Bian City...

378
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:26,043
who brought me to Floral Realm
to obtain Night Rattan.

379
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:28,648
I'm fine now. Please don't worry.

380
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:31,575
Night Rattan is the
sacred relic of Floral Realm.

381
00:24:32,044 --> 00:24:34,086
They are willing to give it out...

382
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,140
means the chiefs are kind.

383
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Father,

384
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,457
it took a lot of troubles
to seek the Night Rattan.

385
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,810
This was helped by a fairy from...

386
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,125
Floral Realm named Jin Mi.

387
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:47,680
She saved his life.

388
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:49,642
Jin Mi has...

389
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,467
saved me many times.

390
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,628
I owe my life to her.

391
00:24:53,904 --> 00:24:55,353
We were able to trap Qiong Qi...

392
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:56,712
was because of her help too.

393
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,698
Where is she now?

394
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,151
I want to reward her.

395
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,047
As she broke the Floral Realm's laws,

396
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,728
she's locked up in the Water Mirror...

397
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,212
by Chief Peony.

398
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,243
This is the internal
matter of Floral Realm.

399
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,260
I cannot interfere.

400
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,967
Let's wait for some time.

401
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
Once Chief Peony is no longer upset,

402
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,751
invite Jin Mi...

403
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,221
to Heaven Realm.

404
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,812
We can then reward her.

405
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,658
I thank you on behalf of Jin Mi.

406
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:31,368
Xu Feng has trapped Qiong
Qi and done a great job.

407
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,608
Father,

408
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:35,571
the sealing of Qiong Qi...

409
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:38,647
was done by Night Immortal,
Jin Mi and Princess of Bian City.

410
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,187
When I was poisoned,

411
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,930
Night Immortal had been
rushing about...

412
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:44,471
even ruined his own cultivation
and gave me his magical prowess.

413
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:46,598
I feel very bad about it.

414
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:51,422
God bless Fire Immortal.

415
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:53,712
I only did what I could.

416
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:57,880
Alright.

417
00:25:58,051 --> 00:25:59,177
Stop pushing around.

418
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:01,416
I'm happy to see both of you...

419
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,266
caring for each other.

420
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:06,373
I will reward you two with
10000 years old fire ginseng,

421
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,226
and 1000 years old snow lotus
to recuperate.

422
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:13,253
Retrieve your rewards at the
Highest Palace 3 days later.

423
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,010
- Thank you, father.
- Thank you, father.

424
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:18,416
Welcome.

425
00:26:38,712 --> 00:26:40,912
I receive the rewards although
I was just doing my duty.

426
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:42,004
Your Highness!

427
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:47,141
Your Highness, you're finally back.

428
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,753
- I'm back.
- Greetings, Princess Sui He.

429
00:26:51,253 --> 00:26:52,533
Greetings, Night Immortal.

430
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,575
Who are you?

431
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,318
She is Princess of Bian City
from the Demon Realm.

432
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,237
Liu Ying, this is the leader of
bird tribe, Princess Sui He.

433
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:05,670
I have heard your name
before, Princess of Bian City.

434
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,753
Nice to meet you, Princess Sui He.

435
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,378
Princess of Bian City
is really different.

436
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,068
From far away,

437
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:15,211
I thought you are one of the
fairies in Heaven Realm.

438
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,044
I have mistaken.

439
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,169
I'm used to being a demon.

440
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:21,670
I have no desire to mix with
those from Heaven Realm.

441
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,247
I invite Liu Ying as my special guest.

442
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,513
Why do you come here today?

443
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,609
Your Highness, after you
went to Demon Realm,

444
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,013
I miss you a lot.

445
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,495
I keep coming over to Qiwu Palace
to get to your news.

446
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:36,958
When I heard you are
coming back today,

447
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,125
I immediately come here.

448
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,656
But both of you went to
Shengjing Court first.

449
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:41,961
And only come back now.

450
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,003
Arresting Qiong Qi is a huge matter.

451
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,177
Naturally, we have to
report to father first.

452
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:47,461
Of course.

453
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:49,128
Congratulations for your success.

454
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,128
Fire Immortal.

455
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:55,614
Fire Immortal, why do you look pale?

456
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,336
Did something happen?

457
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,626
I'm fine.

458
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,193
I pass by...

459
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,960
and noticed that
there's commotion here.

460
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:06,263
I thought what has happened.

461
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,223
Xu Feng has finally come back.

462
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:09,388
Greetings, uncle.

463
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Good.

464
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,798
Greetings, Moon Immortal.

465
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:13,960
Greetings, Moon Immortal.

466
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:15,498
Uncle.

467
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,052
You are disobedient.

468
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,922
Always do things alone
and go out at night.

469
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:20,609
You have never visited me either.

470
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:23,085
Please forgive me, uncle.
I have tasks to do.

471
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,313
I have to be responsible.

472
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,014
I will visit you at House of Marriage
more often.

473
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:29,157
Good.

474
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,955
You... Never mind.

475
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:36,531
Jin Mi, why have you changed...

476
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:38,433
after going to Heaven Realm?

477
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:40,586
Uncle, this is not Jin Mi.

478
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,277
She is Princess of Bian City.

479
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:43,817
Who is King of Bian City?

480
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:46,938
Is he the long eggplant?

481
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,711
Among the kings in the Demon Realm,

482
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,299
his heart is the softest.

483
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,189
He is also very kind.

484
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,793
I helped him with
his marriage back then.

485
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:56,996
Uncle.

486
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,490
Liu Ying, uncle loves to joke.

487
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:01,670
Don't take it to heart.

488
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,101
It's alright. Since he is your uncle,

489
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:05,970
I'll treat him like my own uncle.

490
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,420
Xu Feng, Heaven and Demon Realms
are now a family.

491
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,003
This has never happened before.

492
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,348
You're right, he is the long eggplant.

493
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,011
I'm his daughter.

494
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,315
Thank you, Moon Immortal,

495
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,276
for finding a good
marriage for my father.

496
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:21,373
Thus, I am born.

497
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,083
Whoever thought that
the long eggplant...

498
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:26,731
will have a daughter
akin to hot chilli?

499
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,337
I like you.

500
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,725
Good, it's great.

501
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:32,409
Xu Feng always brings back...

502
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,991
a woman each time he comes back.

503
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,787
Each of them is beautiful and clever.

504
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:38,343
I...

505
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,631
won't need to worry about
your marriage anymore.

506
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:44,190
Where is Jin Mi?

507
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,574
Doesn't she come back with you all?

508
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,203
She returns to Floral Realm.

509
00:29:48,836 --> 00:29:50,356
Why do you let her go?

510
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:51,715
Now that she left,

511
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,087
who will talk with me,
watch performance...

512
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,528
and joke with me?

513
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:56,704
No, this won't do.

514
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,550
Xu Feng, hurry and invite her back.

515
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,699
I want you two to marry.

516
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,545
You work very hard normally.

517
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,548
It's better to take a
break for a while.

518
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:09,496
I help people to marry.

519
00:30:09,605 --> 00:30:10,897
What's the way to relax?

520
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,264
- Run Yu.
- I'm already engaged.

521
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:14,859
You don't need to worry about me.

522
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,446
Silly child,

523
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,308
I know you are engaged.

524
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,792
It's all because of Heavenly Emperor
who simply matched you up with her.

525
00:30:20,794 --> 00:30:23,510
We don't know where is the daughter of
Water Immortal.

526
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,647
Next time,

527
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:26,483
I will invite Immortal Jiyuan
over for a game of chess.

528
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:27,624
I will help you to ask.

529
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,835
If the woman still doesn't show up,

530
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,461
I'll help you to find a
few potential matches.

531
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:35,134
So that you won't be alone...

532
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
in Xuanji Palace.

533
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:43,580
Moon Immortal is kind.

534
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,228
My parents are still grateful to you.

535
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:50,208
Can you help me to find a partner?.

536
00:30:50,286 --> 00:30:52,035
As expected from you,
little hot chilli.

537
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:54,658
I think Xu Feng is perfect.

538
00:30:55,374 --> 00:30:57,123
Why do you always involve me?

539
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,128
Little chilli, this is for you.

540
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,035
You can tie to any man you like.

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,440
Just tie it to the ankle of that man.

542
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,459
He will only love you.

543
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:07,572
Even if he has wings,

544
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:10,435
he won't be able to escape from you.

545
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:12,449
I won't reject an elder's gift.

546
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,462
Thank you, Moon Immortal.

547
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:22,133
But who should I tie this to?

548
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:27,295
Let me think carefully.

549
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,702
Xu Feng, you are injured.

550
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,794
I'm not.

551
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,034
You were poisoned.

552
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:52,189
How are your injuries?

553
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,643
Although the poison is removed,

554
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,503
but you need to recover your health.

555
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,420
But with your ability,

556
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,336
how can Qiong Qi hurt you?

557
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:07,344
His Highness is known as God of Wars,
has gone through countless battles.

558
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,793
How did Qiong Qi hurt you?

559
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,836
Qiong Qi definitely cannot defeat
Xu Feng.

560
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,950
But he's a mystical ancient creature,
he is cunning.

561
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,003
It's difficult to defend effectively.

562
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:19,206
This happened in the Demon Realm.

563
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:20,626
We couldn't protect Xu Feng.

564
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,193
I am sorry.

565
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,028
Fire Immortal is very
important figure.

566
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,862
If he is injured...

567
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,769
and if Heavenly Emperor knows this,

568
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:30,563
it will hurt the relationship
between Heaven and Demon Realms.

569
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,479
I have reported to father.

570
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,887
He won't blame anyone.

571
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:39,877
Liu Ying helped a lot
when we were subduing Qiong Qi.

572
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,336
His Majesty is generous,
Your Highness is kind.

573
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:45,485
Since none of you blame
the Demon Realm,

574
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:47,044
I won't say anything else.

575
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:49,586
But there is a limit to everything.

576
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,545
That's enough, let's put this to rest.

577
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,628
Don't mention this anymore.

578
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:57,545
This must be kept secret from mother.

579
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,836
She always likes to make a big fuss.

580
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,211
Don't let her worry.

581
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,179
How long are you going
to keep it a secret?

582
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,200
Greetings.
- Greetings.

583
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:11,029
- That's enough.
- Mother.

584
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,744
Why did you get up? Have a sit.

585
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,271
What is going on?

586
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,499
It's just a small matter.

587
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,077
How did you know about it?

588
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Is there anything I don't
know in Heaven Realm?

589
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:24,492
When I was at Shengjing Court,

590
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,562
Heavenly Emperor rewarded
you with fire ginseng...

591
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,151
and snow lotus.

592
00:33:29,477 --> 00:33:31,088
I knew there must be
something going on.

593
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,357
I was careless.

594
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:35,041
I was hurt by the plague needle
when I was fighting with Qiong Qi.

595
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,752
I'm fine now. Don't worry, mother.

596
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,821
Why don't you tell me earlier?

597
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,926
The situation is delicate.

598
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,183
If the news of me being
poisoned spread,

599
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,805
those with bad intention might...

600
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,130
manipulate this issue.

601
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:52,175
Fortunately, brother and
Liu Ying were there.

602
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:53,707
They immediately cured me.

603
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,652
It's fortunate that Xu Feng
is back safely today.

604
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,619
If he is hurt,

605
00:34:00,793 --> 00:34:02,875
each of you will not
be able to get away with it.

606
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,187
But I don't understand one thing.

607
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,381
Run Yu and Xu Feng went to
arrest Qiong Qi together.

608
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:12,768
Why is my son the only one injured?

609
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,595
Could it be that someone...

610
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:18,068
waiting to reap the benefits
when my son is in trouble?

611
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:22,044
Mother, it was my careless mistake.

612
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:25,098
It has nothing to do with anyone.
I was set up by Qiong Qi.

613
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:28,044
Don't worry, I'll recover
these few days.

614
00:34:28,628 --> 00:34:30,503
When you were undergoing Nirvana,

615
00:34:30,961 --> 00:34:32,765
you were attacked by a man in black.

616
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:34,364
Have you gotten any clue yet?

617
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Don't worry, mother. I'm
still investigating.

618
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
I'll be fair and won't
accuse any innocent person.

619
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:42,253
It's alright, you must
find out the truth.

620
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,343
After the truth is out,

621
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:45,849
I will make sure...

622
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:48,146
the person receives his punishment.

623
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,114
It's already night.

624
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:53,128
Shouldn't you go to work
for the night shift?

625
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,048
I will leave first then.

626
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,531
I have 2 more marriages
to settle too.

627
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:08,914
I will leave too.

628
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:11,128
Little chilli, do you want
to follow me?

629
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,915
Let's go and play at
House of Marriage.

630
00:35:13,003 --> 00:35:14,043
Sure.

631
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:15,919
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

632
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,310
Let's go.

633
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:23,378
I am also leaving then.

634
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,066
What's wrong?

635
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,966
Are you blaming me for
finding faults with Run Yu?

636
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,565
Mother, I grew up with Run Yu.

637
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:42,965
Our bond is strong.

638
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:45,793
You have raised him since young.

639
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,326
Why must you find his faults?

640
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:49,381
He is like his mother.

641
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,541
His mother is disgraceful.

642
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,005
Run Yu is also not a simple character.

643
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,331
I will not let him...

644
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,982
affect you negatively.

645
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,824
Mother, besides brother and I,

646
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,759
does father have other children?

647
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:11,916
Why? What have you heard?

648
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:14,172
I have seen a drawing in
Shengjing Court before.

649
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:17,211
It depicts the late Floral Immortal.

650
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,275
Don't mention the past.

651
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:29,034
Mother, the late Floral Immortal has
passed away 4000 years ago.

652
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,776
Why are you still troubled by it?

653
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:32,044
You know nothing.

654
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:35,295
Back then, Zi Fen...

655
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:37,836
used her beauty...

656
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:39,336
to seduce your father.

657
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,927
Does this mean...

658
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,712
father was in a relationship
with the late Floral Immortal?

659
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,760
If it was just a normal romance,
it would be alright.

660
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:51,461
But your father wanted to abolish
my crown as Heavenly Empress...

661
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,023
because of her.

662
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:57,545
It's a good thing that
I was able to stop him.

663
00:36:57,753 --> 00:37:00,836
If not, I have no idea...

664
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:02,839
how we would be today.

665
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,197
It's fated that she passed away.

666
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,013
Why did you ask this all of a sudden?

667
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:16,712
Jin Mi, it seems that we cannot be...

668
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:18,169
together in this life.

669
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,282
Xu Feng,

670
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,093
Xu Feng.

671
00:37:23,836 --> 00:37:25,670
You are the successor of your father.

672
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:29,877
I will do my best to protect you.

673
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,501
I will destroy all those
who try to stop you.

674
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,053
Mother, listen to me.

675
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,512
If you really want to help me,

676
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,423
stop saying such words...

677
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,848
in front of me.

678
00:37:41,253 --> 00:37:43,211
And let go of your
resentment towards father.

679
00:37:43,548 --> 00:37:44,632
Stop the dissent.

680
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,859
I have no desire to replace father.

681
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:50,044
I only hope father and you
will live forever.

682
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,732
I want to serve both of you forever.

683
00:37:54,194 --> 00:37:55,695
What are you saying?

684
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:57,873
Never mind.

685
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,744
Take a good rest these few days.

686
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:02,700
Don't go anywhere else. Understand?

687
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:04,130
Yes.

688
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:30,003
Father?

689
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,689
Father.

690
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,461
Run Yu, why are you here?

691
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:42,161
I want to take some books
from Shengjing Court.

692
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,447
So I pass by here.

693
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:46,206
But father seems to be relaxing today,

694
00:38:46,634 --> 00:38:48,342
viewing the flowers here.

695
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,993
They are just fake flowers.

696
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,979
I don't have the mood to view them.

697
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:58,169
I am still worried about
Qiong Qi's matter.

698
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,794
That's why I take a walk here.

699
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:02,311
Oh, right.

700
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:05,378
You have also been to Demon Realm
to handle Qiong Qi's case.

701
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,378
Tell me your opinions.

702
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,293
I don't dare to say anything.

703
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,153
Don't worry, this is not
the Highest Palace.

704
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,723
I think that Qiong Qi...

705
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,877
would not able to escape
from the cauldron.

706
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:21,531
Someone in the Demon Realm...

707
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:23,632
wanted to create chaos.

708
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,666
He wants to destroy the peace
and order of the six realms.

709
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,311
But it's good that...

710
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,165
Qiong Qi is recaptured.

711
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,106
So, the culprit's plan has failed.

712
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:41,044
Then what do you think
is his intention?

713
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,509
The six realms will be affected
each time Qiong Qi appears.

714
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:48,044
No matter what his intention is,

715
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:52,169
he is an enemy of the six realms.

716
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,867
Do you agree that the six
realms need to be unified?

717
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,919
To unite the six realms,
wars are inevitable.

718
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:03,311
I think that...

719
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:07,784
there is no realm having
such strength as for now.

720
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:11,411
Even Heaven Realm may
not be able to do it.

721
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,378
Run Yu, you're right.

722
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:22,753
Oh right, aren't you going
to Shengjing Court?

723
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,371
Hurry and go then.

724
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,223
Then I won't disturb you anymore.

725
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,242
I will leave first.

726
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,960
No chance of winning?
If uniting the six realms...

727
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:46,810
is an easy task,

728
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,253
then it won't be challenging anymore.

729
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,652
If I want to be succeed,

730
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
I still need to wait for a while.

731
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:57,919
Qiong Qi, I let you go this time.

732
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,896
Don't let me down again.

733
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,919
The saying goes, parents know
their children best.

734
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,040
But my son is not on the same boat
with me.

735
00:41:11,877 --> 00:41:14,503
I don't know what for
I'm doing all these.

736
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:16,677
His Highness will understand...

737
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,504
your thoughts one day.

738
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:21,046
But now, the people around him...

739
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,579
are all sceptical.

740
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,521
Princes of Bian City, Liu Ying...

741
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,448
has only met with His
Highness for a few days.

742
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:28,163
But she is already
calling him Brother Feng.

743
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:30,218
She doesn't even care
whether His Highness...

744
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:31,732
will be talked by people.

745
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:34,712
This is not a big issue.

746
00:41:35,545 --> 00:41:38,586
Xu Feng was injured in Demon Realm.

747
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:40,271
What do you think about this?

748
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,240
I think something is
strange about this.
