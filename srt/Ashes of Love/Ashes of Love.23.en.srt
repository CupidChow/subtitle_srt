00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 23"

3
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,060
My respects, Auntie.

4
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,080
King Yi sent someone
with an edict to invite the Saint Girl

5
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,860
It's over. I'm done.

6
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,220
This short-lived ghost will let me
be an immolation, won't he?

7
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,220
I heard that King Yi recently
has a physical malaise,

8
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
and needs to be healed by
Saint Girl of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

9
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,700
King Yi has a physical malaise.

10
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,920
Jin Mi, if anything should go wrong with King Yi,

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,700
how can you be good?

12
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,280
Auntie,

13
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,220
why don't you let me treat King Yi first?

14
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,880
If nothing goes wrong with my body,

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,280
that would mean the Elixir
has been successfully refined.

16
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,880
By then, I will go find another piece of Snow Ginseng,

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,540
and refine the Longevity Qiankun Elixir.

18
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,940
Auntie, please rest assured.

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,380
I will follow the example of the past Saint Girls

20
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,860
and bear in mind the regulations
of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

21
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,220
I won't fail the teachings of Auntie

22
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,100
and the elders.

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,340
By now,

24
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,180
it's useless to focus on the issue of right and wrong.

25
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
You will first go and check

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,660
the physical conditions of King Yi.

27
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,060
Yes, I will first go pick up the imperial edict.

28
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,700
King Yi, you must be fine.

29
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,460
Auntie, I don't know when I’ll return.

30
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,720
If anything happens to me,

31
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,900
the next Saint Girl will be determined by Auntie.

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,900
Don't worry about the Saint Doctors' Family.

33
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,660
I will handle it.

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,580
The Beiyuan Villa has many rituals,

35
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,260
so it's not so free as in the Saint Doctors’ Family.

36
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,100
You should be extremely careful.

37
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,660
Don't go beyond the limits
of your actions nor forget your origin.

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
You should always remember
your duty as the Saint Girl.

39
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes, I will remember the teachings of Auntie.

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,140
Qiang Huo, take care of the Saint Girl.

41
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,900
and report the physical condition
of King Yi at all times.

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,300
Auntie, please rest assured.

43
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,340
Respected Elders and Auntie, take care.

44
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,880
Auntie, the Qiankun Elixir was really eaten by me.

45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,200
If only Qiang Huo returns alive.

46
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,740
Auntie, please don't blame her.

47
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,100
You're good, Qiang Huo.

48
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,360
This time,

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
we had a really good cooperation.

50
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,820
Saint Girl, you're getting more and more daring.

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
How dare you lie with Auntie?

52
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm naively, too.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,540
Qiang Huo, look!

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,540
That looks delicious!

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,000
Stop!

56
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Steamed buns!

57
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,100
Hot steamed buns!

58
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,480
Jin Mi,

59
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,980
let’s have a look at it.

60
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
I want this, this and this.

61
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,560
Okay, I'll wrap it up for you.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,660
Do you think we've bought enough?

63
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,800
Yes, that's enough.

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,220
Thank you.

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
Thank you. And See you.

66
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,860
Slow down! Take it easy! Look at this!

67
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
Pastries!

68
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,460
Jin Mi, I’ve never seen this before.

69
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,380
They look so delicious.

70
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,820
They really are delicious.

71
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,660
Since you think it’s good,
I’ll buy each of them.

72
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,980
Tastes good?

73
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,580
Hey, Lady!

74
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,320
You try it.

75
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,800
"Fortune-telling"

76
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,840
Your veil!

77
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,360
You’re an orphan, right?

78
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
I never tell a fortune for others randomly.

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,100
I only choose the fated ones.

80
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,380
I think you two

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,260
must be good friends since very young.

82
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,860
You can even die for each other.

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,100
And you're charged with an important task.

84
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm afraid this is going to
have an inexorable doom.

85
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,640
Sir,

86
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,720
what inexorable doom do you mean?

87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,200
This is something I cannot divulge!

88
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,700
You’re a fairy who came down to the mortal world.

89
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,680
Looks so alike!

90
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,660
Not a man has ever seen my face in the past.

91
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,300
But the portrait looks so alike me.

92
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,240
Is he really an expert from the outside world?

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,400
This time, your trip to the mortal world

94
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
is to find a man you truly love.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
A man?
You made it wrong!

96
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,000
Our Saint Girl will never get married.

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,260
Who is that man?

98
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,680
His name is

99
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,820
Yan You

100
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,620
Yan You?

101
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,440
This...

102
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,120
what’s written on it?

103
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,700
Sometimes be a man and sometimes be a woman.

104
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,140
And this is my notes taken when I read it,

105
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,700
just to make a memo.

106
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,940
Pictures about the Beauties in the Six Realms

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,480
There they are!

108
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Go quickly!

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,000
Who are you?

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm just a poor fortune-teller.

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,080
Telling from your faces, officers,

112
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
you will hit a bad patch.

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,780
Be careful with your feet.

114
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,660
Lady, please get on the cart.

115
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,900
Let's go.

116
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,780
Move.

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,800
Lady, I'm not done yet.

118
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
Where are you going?

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,300
Officer, where is the lady going?

120
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,520
Forgive me, I have nothing to tell.

121
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,940
I'm on business today.

122
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,540
It’s a pity that I have no time
to ask for your suggestion.

123
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,500
But tomorrow I will handle affairs in the Beiyuan Villa.

124
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Sir, would you please come and meet us there?

125
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,860
You can then tell the fortune for us
and be presented a grand reward.

126
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,720
Yes, yes, Yes.

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Well, that's good.

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,840
-Let's go.
-Move.

129
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,110
"House of Fragrance"

130
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,240
What is this place?

131
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,240
This is the House of Fragrance.

132
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,840
The best teahouse in town.

133
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,140
Lady, you've been through a long trip.

134
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,940
You can have a cup of tea and rest inside.

135
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,240
before heading for the Beiyuan Villa.

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,060
Please!

137
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,304
"House of Fragrance"

138
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,540
My Lord.

139
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,460
You must be the Saint Girl
of the Saint Doctors’ Family?

140
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,240
This is Duck Nanping

141
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,180
Duck, what's his background?

142
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,740
My respects, Duck Nanping.

143
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,620
Take your seat.

144
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
I came to meet you in person today,

145
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,620
because I’m truly worried about
the physical condition of King Yi.

146
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,260
It's a great matter of our country Huaiwu.

147
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,800
Therefore, I would like to have a
deliberate discussion with you.

148
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,900
How to nurse the health of King Yi.

149
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,360
and make him enjoy health and longevity

150
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,080
will bring benefits for the people of Huaiwu

151
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,820
and safeguard the prosperity of our country.

152
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,260
Please rest assured, Duck Nanping.

153
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
The health of King Yi is

154
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,320
the biggest focus of the Saint Doctors’ Family,

155
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,320
and also my duty.

156
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,220
I’ll try my best

157
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,940
to cure his Majesty.

158
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,240
You're wholehearted!

159
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
But...

160
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,600
I still have some details

161
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,700
to discuss with you alone.

162
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,700
Please come with me.

163
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:19,228
"Beiyuan Villa"

164
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,860
That Duck Nanping,

165
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
what did he talk with you just now?

166
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,480
About the physical condition of King Yi,

167
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,680
I hope you can report it to me at all times.

168
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,880
I want to know how serious his illness is.

169
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,500
I see.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,760
The mission of the Saint Doctors’ Family
is to be loyal to King Yi.

171
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,160
But you should think clearly

172
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,760
which is more important,

173
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,060
the single life of King Yi

174
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,680
or the hundred lives of the
Saint Doctors’ Family are more important.

175
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,080
According to the regulations
of the Saint Doctors’ Family,

176
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,540
if His Majesty dies,

177
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,900
the Saint Girl will be buried with him.

178
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,120
However,

179
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,960
if you can do as I said,

180
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
you can save your own life,

181
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,240
and also the safety of all people
in the Saint Doctors’ Family.

182
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,300
Why do you look so dumb?

183
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,300
Won't it be that King Yi

184
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,220
is too sick to be saved?

185
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,420
No.

186
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,840
The Duck asks me

187
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,260
to take good care of the health of King Yi

188
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,600
and nurse him.

189
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,480
That would be great.

190
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,340
The trip is smooth.

191
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,800
But after entering the town,

192
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,560
a fortune teller came out all of a sudden.

193
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,440
He's a mystery.

194
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,800
Later, a person served Duck Nanping

195
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,920
led the Saint Girl to
the House of Fragrance for a rest.

196
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,100
With too many eyes and ears, I stopped following

197
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,100
and didn't enter the House of Fragrance.

198
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,560
Later, the person served Duck Nanping

199
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,840
sent the Saint Girl to the posthouse for a rest.

200
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,980
A fortune teller...

201
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,900
You go check it out.

202
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Yes.

203
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,340
How about the House of Fragrance?

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
Check the fortune-teller first.

205
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,240
About what happened in the House of Fragrance,

206
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,520
I can guess a little bit without checking.

207
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,180
Yes.

208
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,480
Did she move the entire Saint Doctors’ Family here?

209
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,880
Jin Mi, before the court situation becomes steady,

210
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,880
I didn't want you here to take this.

211
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,880
But since you're already here,

212
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,600
I will do whatever I can

213
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,840
to keep you safe in this mess.

214
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,100
It seems King Yi

215
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,260
is not as ill as we thought.

216
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,400
We've already come here for one day.

217
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,600
but he is not eager to ask you to see him.

218
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,900
But...

219
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,700
the foods he sent here

220
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,560
are really delicious, they're all I love to eat.

221
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,740
There's one thing that's so weird about it.

222
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,960
I just heard the servants say that

223
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,860
there is not a consort in the Beiyuan Villa.

224
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,980
But the emperors have always had a big harem since the ancient time.

225
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,560
And I also heard that King Yi has a matchless

226
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
and peerless face.

227
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,840
There are countless girls in town who admire him.

228
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,380
But there is not a consort in the mansion at all.

229
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,740
Jin Mi, do you think
what the reason is supposed to be?

230
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,520
There's only one possibility.

231
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,540
What is it?

232
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,080
Qiang Huo,

233
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,060
do you know what your name means?

234
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,660
It's acrid and warm, and has strong ability
to release things to the surface.

235
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,820
It can mainly release the wind and
cold dampness of the solar channel.

236
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,900
It can also dispel the wind and
cold dampness and relieve pain.

237
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,280
So it can be used for treating exogenous cold
and headache without sweat,

238
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,900
wet and cold stasis, wind-water puffy swelling

239
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
and sore and ulcer.

240
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,668
That's all?

241
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,627
That's all.

242
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Well,

243
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,980
you really don't know how to
seize the key points while reading.

244
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,240
You didn't get the essence when learning.

245
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,480
No wonder you haven't

246
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,740
made any progress over the years.

247
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,940
Then what else is there?

248
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,460
The main effect of Qiang Huo is

249
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,180
to warm the kidney and help enhance yang,
absorb Qi and stop diarrhea.

250
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,260
It's used to reinforce Yang.

251
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,220
Anyway, it's related to male diseases.

252
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,420
Never mind, just forget it.

253
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,540
You can take your time to comprehend it.

254
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,900
Saint Girl, His Majesty asked you to see him.

255
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,020
Lord Qin Tong has been waiting outside.

256
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,180
My respects, your Majesty.

257
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,560
Have a seat.

258
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,440
Thank you, your Majesty.

259
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Your Majesty, please reach your hand out,

260
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,760
so that I can diagnose your pulse.

261
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,020
As I see,

262
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,280
the pulse is not shallow
nor deep but has even rhythm.

263
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,220
It's calm and gentle, fluent and strong.

264
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
There's no problem.

265
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,740
What's there to diagnose?

266
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,040
Your Majesty, do you feel any discomfort these days?

267
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,700
I feel sick both in my heart and liver.

268
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,320
And I often feel dizzy.

269
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,860
I have also lost my appetite, and can't sleep tight.

270
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,860
No.

271
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,240
These symptoms may be only said by His Majesty.

272
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,720
He deliberately did it to confuse others.

273
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
Is it possible that

274
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,180
he really has that kind of disease.

275
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Majesty, there is no need
to be worried and anxious.

276
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,160
Although I'm a woman,

277
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,240
I am first a doctor,

278
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,240
and then a woman.

279
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,000
And a saying goes that
gender is not considered among doctors.

280
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,280
So Your Majesty, you shouldn't
have any burden in this aspect.

281
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,440
To be frank,

282
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,020
I've made great achievements in this field.

283
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,620
I'm proficient in studying it

284
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,060
and I'm afraid I'm unparalleled in this field in the world.

285
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,860
So I suggest

286
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,680
Your Majesty can try a herb, Qiang Huo.

287
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,640
Qiang Huo?

288
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,560
Exactly.

289
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,720
Apart from dispelling coldness,
eliminating wind and cold,

290
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,480
this medicine can also cure

291
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,080
impo...

292
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,740
this medicine can also cure

293
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,740
your kidney deficiency.

294
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,380
You've made great achievements in this field

295
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,920
and you're proficient in studying it?

296
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,760
Is that what a girl supposed to say?

297
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,880
Your Majesty, there is no need to worry.

298
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,260
The Saint Doctors’ Family

299
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,620
itself exists for the health of Your Majesty.

300
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,220
If your Majesty can be healthy,

301
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll exert all my strength and wisdom
without any hesitation.

302
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,320
You thought too much.

303
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,100
You're useless here.

304
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,960
I feel quite good.

305
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,500
Do you know why I asked you to come over here?

306
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
I don't know.

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Aren't they the manuscripts of me and Crow?

308
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,660
How did they fall into the hands of King Yi?

309
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,500
Your Majesty, I...I...

310
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,800
Do you recognize them?

311
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,800
Yes, I...I...recognize them.

312
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,320
Do you have anything to say about them?

313
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,960
Your... your Majesty

314
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm very guilty and deserve death.

315
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,060
What are your sins?

316
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,360
To save

317
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,980
a friend who was seriously wounded,

318
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
I...I…

319
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,380
gave...

320
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,800
gave him the Snow Ginseng, the guiding drug

321
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,960
of the Longevity Qiankun Elixir, to eat.

322
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,700
But...but I really didn't know that

323
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,900
he is an enemy of your Majesty.

324
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,340
When he was healed,
he went away without saying goodbye.

325
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,340
So I have no idea of his whereabouts.

326
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,640
Enemy?

327
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,440
Do you ever regret saving him?

328
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,900
Never.

329
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,580
It's said that doctors should have a merciful heart.

330
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,120
I wonder if a doctor meets a dying man,

331
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,900
how could he do nothing to save him?

332
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,020
Just like a chevalier in the martial world,

333
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,800
how could he not draw a sword
and render help the person in need?

334
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,000
That's why I saved Crow.

335
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,420
I did it all out of instinct.

336
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,420
I have no regrets for that.

337
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,720
Your Majesty,

338
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,100
if you want to grant me a death today,

339
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,460
I have absolutely no complaints for that.

340
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,460
But the safety of all people
in the Saint Doctors’ Family,

341
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,720
they know nothing about it.

342
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,180
Please don't give any penalty to them, Your Majesty.

343
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,800
Your Majesty, if you really want to execute me,

344
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,620
could you just give me a stab for good?

345
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,700
That would be great.

346
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,980
Are you really willing to die for Crow?

347
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,320
Death will come sooner or later.

348
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,740
I just beg your Majesty not blame
on the Saint Doctors’ Family.

349
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,180
Your Highness.

350
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
Your Highness, are you going out?

351
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,120
Kuang Lu, I'm going out for a trip.

352
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,280
You take care of Xuanji Palace.

353
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,640
Yes.

354
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,840
Okay, stand up.

355
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,680
I dare not.

356
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,680
Then lift your head up,

357
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,260
and look who I am?

358
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,750
Your Majesty has a majestic

359
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,400
and noble look as Hess,

360
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,760
and is tall and straight like a pine tree,

361
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
lofty like a jade mountain to be collapsing

362
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Your Majesty

363
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,600
has an overwhelming light that I dare not face it.

364
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,480
So stubborn!

365
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,480
Come on.

366
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,900
- Look who I am?
- I dare not

367
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,840
I dare not.

368
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm Crow.

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,140
Crow!

370
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,860
How could it be you?

371
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,862
You scared the hell out of me?

372
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,520
You can talk now.

373
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,980
You can hear me now.

374
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,360
Why don't you just be a bandit?

375
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,680
What are you doing here?

376
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,100
Your dressing like this

377
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,920
does make you look like a king.

378
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,220
You...

379
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,200
are not the real king, right?

380
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,140
Your Majesty!

381
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,800
I... I admit my sins.

382
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,680
I admit my sins.

383
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,680
Your Majesty, won't you kill me?

384
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,020
When did I say I'll kill you?

385
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,280
It's probably

386
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,960
what the fabled saying,
a blessing in disguise means?

387
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,520
Crow said when he left that he'll repay the favor.

388
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,260
And he asked me to come here.

389
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,260
Won't it be that he will pay his debt of gratitude?

390
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,700
It's good to repay a favor!

391
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,780
But the royal extravagance is totally different

392
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,920
with such a long foreshadowing

393
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,000
Your Majesty

394
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,440
Here is a battle report.

395
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,280
The Saint Girl has finished the diagnosis.

396
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,780
You come to the study with me.

397
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,220
Yes.

398
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,720
I never thought Crow would be King Yi.

399
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,840
Looks like I saved my little life.

400
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,940
But I haven't diagnosed the illness of King Yi.

401
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,760
How will I report to the Duck Nanping?

402
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,980
And who was the person poisoned King Yi?

403
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,900
Chief Peony.

404
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Jin Mi is experiencing hardships
in the mortal world.

405
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,980
How does your Highness
come to the Floral Realm now?

406
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,660
I'm worried about her experiencing
hardships alone in the mortal world.

407
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,780
I want to go look at it.

408
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,780
So I hereby come to notify the Water Immortal.

409
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
You're really considerate!

410
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,520
Jin Mi is ill-fated.

411
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,000
I want to ask Your Highness,
do you truly love her

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,120
without distractions?

413
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,603
I surely do.

414
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:08,600
You don't need to question that, Chief Peony.

415
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,740
In every case, if one gives true love to the other,

416
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,700
he will wait for equal return from the other.

417
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,800
If Jin Mi is like a barren land

418
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,600
which will never bloom

419
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,740
whatever seed you sow
and whatever fertilizer you apply,

420
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,080
and however you water it

421
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,560
And talking about love with her
is like a stone sinking in the sea,

422
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,140
without any response.

423
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,860
If it's so time consuming and troublesome,
will your Highness fear that?

424
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,220
Why should I fear this?

425
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,120
If the time is bound to be wasted,

426
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,980
then I will only be willing to idle away the time with her.

427
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,700
But,

428
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,840
why are you so pessimistic about Jin Mi's love?

429
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,080
Jin Mi is kind by nature,

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,840
it's just that she was born with indifferent feelings.

431
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,560
No one will come into her eyes,

432
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
nor will he go into her heart.

433
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,240
But I should say

434
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,200
faith will move mountains.

435
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,200
If so,

436
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,040
then I hope Your Highness
will have your wish fulfilled.

437
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,640
Your Highness seems to
have something on your mind.

438
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,200
I know that

439
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,440
it's the destiny of Jin Mi to experience hardships,

440
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,500
but I'm still a little worried.

441
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,500
I want to...

442
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,900
You want to go down to the mortal world.

443
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,180
Yes.

444
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,540
Descending to the mortal world privately
is a violation against the heavenly law.

445
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,540
For the sake of Mi,

446
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,940
whatever just comes if
it violates the heavenly rules.

447
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
I’ll take my leave.

448
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,780
I'll come and play chess
with Mister Immortal next time.

449
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,780
Hold on.

450
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,040
Be careful.

451
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,860
Please rest assured, Mister Immortal.

452
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,180
So Crow is King Yi.

453
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,120
And King Yi is Crow.
Things are unpredictable!

454
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,980
But the words that are annotated here

455
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,580
is exactly the same as Crow.

456
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,900
Is it possible that

457
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Crow lied to me.

458
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,360
Like I said,

459
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
taking the prescription I prepared

460
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,020
he must have recovered within three days.

461
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,620
He even lied to me, pretending not to hear me

462
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,740
and wrote down everything I said.

463
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,620
Didn't he do that to embarrass me deliberately?

464
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,660
Well, never mind.

465
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,180
I forgive his rudeness.

466
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,340
As long as Crow is safe and sound,

467
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,100
that would be great.

468
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
The great immortal... the great immortal...

469
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,940
I beg you to show your power.

470
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
Please show your power.

471
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,780
Bless Crow, bless His Majesty,

472
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,500
a good physical health and longevity.

473
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,540
This way,

474
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,960
I'll be buried with him
to the netherworld a little later.

475
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,300
God Bless.

476
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,260
God Bless. God Bless.

477
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,680
Don't be afraid, Jin Mi.

478
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,660
The great immortal really makes its presence!

479
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm not dreaming, right, the great immortal?

480
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm not dreaming!

481
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,000
I've dreamed of you since I was a kid.

482
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I told people but they didn't believe me.

483
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,740
I never thought I'd see an immortal today.

484
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,100
I truly see you.

485
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,020
I had to be with you in the form of
my primordial spirit in your dream.

486
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,460
If I don't show up now,

487
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,020
I'm afraid I can't keep you anymore.

488
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
It's not a dream at this moment.

489
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,460
I...I saw you in my dream before.

490
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,660
You never say a word.

491
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,560
You...you're...

492
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,240
You're the King of Medicine, Sun Zhenren.

493
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,580
You're touched by my diligence and endeavor

494
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,140
and so you show up to encourage me?

495
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,840
No.

496
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,600
So...so what kind of immortal are you?

497
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,020
I'm just a...

498
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,220
an immortal herding the deer

499
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,140
Well, where's your deer?

500
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,540
I didn't take him with me, I just came myself.

501
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,520
An immortal herding the deer
is anyhow an immortal.

502
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,220
To show up for a mortal like me

503
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,220
would have been hard for the great immortal,

504
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,880
but I even embarrassed him.

505
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,720
I really opened up a can of worms.

506
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,920
He must have felt embarrassed.

507
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,760
I think the post of your great immortal

508
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,960
is very promising.

509
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,960
It's said in the story that

510
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,960
in those days, Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven,

511
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,020
stood out from a Supervisor for Heavenly Horses

512
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,960
in the animal husbandry sector.

513
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,820
How amazing he was in his journey to the West later!

514
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,820
The Buddha even granted him

515
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,080
a title, The Monkey King.

516
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
And also Zhang Guolao, one of the Eight Immortals.

517
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,640
He herded a donkey before he became an immortal.

518
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,900
He became glorious and respectable later.

519
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,400
So, I think

520
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,620
the great immortal have
boundless prospects in the future.

521
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,760
Exactly the same.

522
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,220
Exactly the same.
What do you mean by that?

523
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,760
Who am I exactly the same as?

524
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
A friend of mine.

525
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,240
She said the same thing as you did.

526
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,950
It's indeed my great honor

527
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,920
of saying the same thing as your friend did.

528
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,640
Well...well, that friend of yours,

529
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,620
is she an immortal?

530
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,620
Exactly.

531
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,520
I didn't expect I'm really
related to an immortal a little bit.

532
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,120
Not only a little bit.

533
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,100
Jin Mi, you can call me Run Yu.

534
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,680
Can I?

535
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,440
Immortal Run Yu

536
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,531
"Beiyuan Villa"

537
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,340
The scent of the person who saved me that day

538
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,340
finally led me here.

539
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,900
Is it a coincidence or what?

540
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,720
Who are you?

541
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,440
Why did you use your psychic power to save me?

542
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,680
And why do you sneak into the Beiyuan Villa?

543
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,820
Stop!

544
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:44,860
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow!

545
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,320
The moves...

546
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,140
Are you a friend of mine I once knew?

547
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,727
As the Princess of the Demon Realm,

548
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:51,300
shouldn't you only think of
killing me when you see it?

549
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,960
Why do you ask so many questions instead?

550
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,720
I didn't find that

551
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,960
the firmament of our Demon Realm is so beautiful

552
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,560
What is this?

553
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,660
Today is your birthday.

554
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,140
I saw your mansion was covered with gifts.

555
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,900
I hope

556
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,980
Your Highness will not reject my shabby gift.

557
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,800
The gifts from the six realms

558
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,320
are all the same every year.

559
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,160
I've been bored with that.

560
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,080
To save the face of my father,

561
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,000
I had to go through the motions.

562
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,200
I'll punish you if I'm not satisfied.

563
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,500
You'll have to move everything in my storeroom

564
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,580
to your own room.

565
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,940
so as not to take my place.

566
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,620
I wish Your Highness would like it.

567
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,720
What is this treasure?

568
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,460
What's so special about it?

569
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,720
It is a piece of pure brass

570
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,060
I found in the furthest border
in the mortal world.

571
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,800
You've been missing for three months,

572
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,360
and you went find this thing.

573
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,220
I've watched the weapon of Your Highness.

574
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,940
Your Demon Bone Whip

575
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,260
is not easy to inlay with ornaments

576
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,960
like other swords.

577
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,340
So I went find this piece of brass

578
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,960
and will engrave the name of your Highness on it.

579
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,300
It's just going to fit.

580
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,520
How do you know I envy
Xuan Shou's sword tassels?

581
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,760
In that case, let's do the engraving now.

582
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,780
Your Highness, please wait.

583
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,480
If you use spells,

584
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
it would have nothing different

585
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,220
with the other gifts.

586
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,400
What do you mean?

587
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,060
Inside the Qingtian Cave,

588
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,060
the names we engraved together

589
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,060
and the time we spent together

590
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,860
will never disappear even after thousands of years

591
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,660
and will become our memories

592
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,340
we’ll never wipe away.

593
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,400
That is the gift I'm going to give you.

594
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,620
You do have a mind on it.

595
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,580
I will always carry this gift.

596
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,880
It's your voice, Mu Ci.
