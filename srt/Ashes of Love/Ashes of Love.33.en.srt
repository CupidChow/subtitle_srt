"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 33"

3
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,700
Dad, what are you going to do?

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,420
Sui, you may be accidentally injured.

5
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,880
Come over here.

6
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,860
Sui.

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,602
Why are you

8
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,800
so obsessive with someone

9
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,680
who doesn’t love you?

10
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,220
If he really cared about you,

11
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,960
he would have married you.

12
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,060
Ask them to step back or I won’t come there.

13
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Step back.

14
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,600
Come here.

15
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Come to me.

16
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,740
King Yi, see?

17
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
My daughter is…

18
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Sui.

19
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,620
Dad,

20
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,460
you were nice to me this life.

21
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
I’ll keep it in mind.

22
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
You’re a good dad,

23
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,800
but it is a pity that

24
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,220
compared with Xu Feng,

25
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
you’re nothing

26
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,280
but a mere mortal.

27
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,320
My Lord.

28
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,320
My Lord.

29
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,100
Sui. Sui.

30
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,960
My Lord.

31
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,020
My Lord.

32
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,780
My Lord. My Lord.

33
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
Listen up,
everyone from Duke Nanping Mansion,

34
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,040
if you put down your weapons right now

35
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,800
and fight a battle following His Majesty,

36
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,476
you can expiate your crime by good deeds

37
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,320
and won’t be punished

38
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,440
for assassinating His Majesty.

39
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,920
Or your nine clans will be killed.

40
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,420
I didn’t know

41
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,820
my dad would commit regicide.

42
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,620
I…

43
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,680
I…

44
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,020
You have just repelled the army of Liangguo.

45
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,080
Would you like to
rest for a night before you leave?

46
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,360
Cousin.

47
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,360
Go.

48
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,960
Cousin.

49
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
My dad is dead.

50
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,020
Now I can only depend on you.

51
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,260
I know.

52
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,200
I’ll keep what you did for Huaiwu

53
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
in my mind.

54
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,500
If you meet any problems in the future,

55
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,500
I won’t stand idly by.

56
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,660
I have only one problem,

57
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,100
that is, I want you to marry me willingly.

58
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,140
Do you still mind the affair
between Lord Puchi and me?

59
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,700
That was a mistake.

60
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
My love for you is so true.

61
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,040
I’ll marry no one but you this life.

62
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,160
Sui He.

63
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,121
Life is vain and
I’m just a passerby in the world.

64
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,540
If you don’t promise me,

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,000
I don’t want to live anymore.

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Sui He,

67
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,840
I love someone

68
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,780
and can’t love others.

69
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,300
So from today on,

70
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,320
I’ll treat you as my real sister.

71
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
Do you love

72
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,280
Jin Mi?

73
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Yes.

74
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,100
Why?

75
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,720
She’s Saint Girl of Saint Doctors’ Family.

76
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
It’s impossible for you to marry her.

77
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,920
Cousin.

78
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,380
I fell in love with you since I was a child.

79
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,680
I have done so much for you.

80
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:20,666
I even killed dad…

81
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,140
Why are you so cruel to me?

82
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,500
Sui He.

83
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,900
I know your mind.

84
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,380
I’m grateful for

85
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,200
what you’ve done for me,

86
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,680
but

87
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,040
it has also terrified me.

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
I know I’m unable to repay your kindness.

89
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,340
If you’re in danger

90
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,100
in the future,

91
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,040
I’ll protect you with my life.

92
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
But I can by no means

93
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,020
marry you.

94
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,620
Cousin,

95
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,380
what I have done is all for you.

96
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,800
What’s special about Jin Mi?

97
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,380
You chase her both in heaven and earth.

98
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,140
Sui He.

99
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,860
You’re unstable after
so many things happened in these days.

100
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,180
Let’s talk about it another day.

101
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,080
Why haven’t you taken off
your amour yet, Your Majesty?

102
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,260
Is the horse ready?

103
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,060
Yes.

104
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
I chose a team of elite soldiers

105
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,320
to escort you to the Villa.

106
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,460
Send Princess back.

107
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,400
Jin Mi, I won’t let you get what you want.

108
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,120
Your Majesty.

109
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,580
Am I dreaming again?

110
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
No.

111
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,860
You’re back.

112
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,880
I wanted to see you earlier.

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,140
What’s wrong with you?

114
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Qiang Huo said you got inflamed.

115
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,780
You know

116
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,360
I never believe in her medical skill.

117
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,440
Moreover, you’re so weak now.

118
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,280
I don’t believe you just got inflamed.

119
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,920
Is it that you’re poisoned

120
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
when you study those strange herbs?

121
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,180
Jin Mi, you know your symptoms best.

122
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,020
Tell me what happened to you.

123
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,620
Your Majesty,

124
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
although Qiang Huo is not as skilled as me,

125
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,380
she is a member of
Saint Doctors’ Family after all.

126
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,880
I did

127
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,600
get inflamed.

128
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,960
How come

129
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,160
you’re so weak

130
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
and coughed so badly?

131
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,440
I don’t know much about medicine,

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,120
but you can’t lie to me.

133
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
How dare I lie to you?

134
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,200
I actually

135
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,360
have been prone to get inflamed
since I was a child.

136
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,560
I may go faint after eating just one litchi,

137
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,740
but I’m good at pharmacy,

138
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,740
so I have developed

139
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
a kind of medicine

140
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,900
to cure this symptom once and for all.

141
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,940
I just wanted to try it out,

142
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,580
so I ate some longans.

143
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,240
Unexpectedly, I passed out at once.

144
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,860
That’s embarrassing.

145
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,100
Where is the medicine?

146
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,520
How many tablets should you take?

147
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,820
Three ones.

148
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,740
Take them.

149
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,360
Lie down and have a good rest.

150
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,640
Your Majesty, I didn’t lie to you, right?

151
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,060
After taking the medicine,

152
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,640
I feel much better now.

153
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,480
I’m all right.

154
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
How about

155
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,820
taking a walk in the courtyard

156
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,700
or playing chess with you?

157
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,440
Promise me

158
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,660
you can’t scare me like that again.

159
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,860
Your Majesty,

160
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
did you return from the battlefield directly?

161
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,100
So what?

162
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,580
I just heard that you’re God of War before,

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,180
but I have never

164
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,620
seen you in martial attire.

165
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
They’re right.

166
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,140
You look handsome.

167
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,700
Princess Sui He, what can I do for you?

168
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
Send this letter

169
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,120
to the monarch of Liangguo in person.

170
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,400
I promise him that I’ll cooperate
with him in wiping out Huaiwu.

171
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,000
With this letter,

172
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,180
the King of Liangguo will
definitely go out to battle in person.

173
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,800
You must try every means

174
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,440
to make sure that
no mistake is made this time.

175
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,180
I did notice

176
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,300
the smell of Mu Ci.

177
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,960
Yes.

178
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,060
Once the monarch of Liangguo
goes out to battle in person,

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,060
Xu Feng will accept battle in person too.

180
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,280
When he leaves Beiyuan Villa,

181
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,280
you have to kill Jin Mi for me.

182
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
It turns out that his target is Jin Mi.

183
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,880
Even without Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

184
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,640
you should send her back to Heaven Realm
to restart experiencing hardships.

185
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,440
I can hardly wait.

186
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,360
Wait, Your Highness.

187
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,380
Her Majesty ordered me

188
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,380
to recover Spirit-Vanishing Arrow first.

189
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,900
She worries that

190
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,300
someone may harm the second Prince

191
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,640
with this arrow.

192
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,740
So does she know your arrangement?

193
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,540
In this case,

194
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,860
after sending the letter,

195
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
go to protect Xu Feng.

196
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,720
If anyone wants to hurt him
with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

197
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,820
you can take the chance to take the arrow

198
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,280
to kill Jin Mi.

199
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Yes.

200
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,300
It turns out that you left
without saying a word that day

201
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,300
was to kill Jin Mi.

202
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,860
She is my friend.

203
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,520
I won’t allow you to hurt her.

204
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,800
Mu Ci, what has happened
to you all these years?

205
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,420
Why do you want to kill her?

206
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,960
If you have any trouble, you can tell me.

207
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,320
I’ll help you.

208
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,180
If you insist on killing her,

209
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,440
you are my enemy.

210
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,960
That’s better.

211
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,180
Why is there the smell
of my bones and blood here?

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,680
Luckily,

213
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,520
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow is hanging here,

214
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,340
but it doesn’t hurt the second Princess.

215
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,360
Jin Mi, I’m sorry.

216
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,940
It’s my fault.

217
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,660
Jin Mi.

218
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,620
You must be crazy

219
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,800
to take three tablets of Wu Yin.

220
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,040
Only it can suppress

221
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,140
the syndrome of Qing Yue.

222
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,020
But it’s also poisonous.

223
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,400
Taking such a deadly poison, you’ll die.

224
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,340
I have only some time to stay with him.

225
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,040
I don’t want him to see my sickly look

226
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,260
and worry about me

227
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,640
when he is with me.

228
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,800
In the past,

229
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,800
I thought you were
the smartest person in the world,

230
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
but now to me

231
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,060
you’re totally a fool.

232
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,240
Jin Mi.

233
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,620
Jin Mi.

234
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,160
Jin Mi.

235
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,680
Your Majesty.

236
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,860
Your Majesty,

237
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,160
Saint Girl is getting changed.

238
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,140
Please wait for a while in the courtyard.

239
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,140
OK.

240
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,320
Your Majesty,

241
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,520
you’re going to the front line again.

242
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,180
Originally, I thought
after we defeated Liangguo,

243
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,180
they would take no action in a short time.

244
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,180
However, it’s out of expectation that

245
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,580
the King of Liangguo will fight personally,

246
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,560
so I have to accept battle again.

247
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,560
Your Majesty,

248
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,960
I…

249
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,460
I’m afraid I can’t wait for you.

250
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,880
What? You can’t wait for these few days?

251
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Originally, I thought

252
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
as you were so stubborn before,

253
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,240
we had to wait for all this life.

254
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,740
I thought the happiest time in my life

255
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,848
would come after we died

256
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:31,142
and were buried
in the emperor’s tomb together.

257
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,680
But now

258
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,440
you’re willing to wait for me

259
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,100
and create future with me.

260
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,360
Happiness comes so fast

261
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,860
that it’s like a dream.

262
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,120
Jin Mi,

263
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,360
do you really want to be with me

264
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,160
and be my queen forever?

265
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,900
I do.

266
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,020
But how about your promise to the people?

267
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,900
You said you won’t get married

268
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,360
before unifying the state.

269
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,880
This is just nonsense.

270
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,440
It was just because
you were so stubborn back then

271
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,060
that I used it as an excuse

272
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,420
to refuse the officials.

273
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,080
But I really want to

274
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,080
declare to the world

275
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
and let everyone know

276
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,860
you’re my queen now.

277
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,940
Since I’ve promised you,

278
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,400
I’ll always wait for you here.

279
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,860
Aren’t you going to make a plan

280
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,140
to help me get rid of the status of Saint Girl?

281
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,540
We have a whole life,

282
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,640
so don’t be hasty now.

283
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,760
But...

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,160
What?

285
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
It’ll be your greatest honor

286
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,160
to marry me as your queen.

287
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,920
Don’t think of taking consorts afterwards.

288
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,060
You can’t even take a look at other girls.

289
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,060
You know?

290
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,620
Of course, this is my greatest honor.

291
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
I’m unwilling to turn my eyes away from you.

292
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,300
However, you haven’t seen

293
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,520
my face until now.

294
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,980
How do you know
that you won’t turn your eyes away?

295
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,980
What if I am ugly and you regret?

296
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,760
How about

297
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,220
taking it off now?

298
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,700
No need.

299
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,000
Even if you’re ugly,

300
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,220
don’t try to escape from me.

301
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,500
You don’t have to take off the veil now.

302
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
On our wedding night,

303
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,600
after I pick off your red veil,

304
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
you’ll be my ugly wife by then

305
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,880
and you can’t escape even if you want to.

306
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,920
Sorry, I can’t tell you the truth.

307
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
Your Majesty, go to fight without anxiety.

308
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,060
Your Majesty,

309
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,200
it’s time for you to set out.

310
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,920
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

311
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,560
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

312
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,980
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

313
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,780
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

314
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,420
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>

315
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,360
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

316
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,240
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

317
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,960
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

318
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,200
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>

319
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,200
That day I got drunk

320
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,200
and offended you,

321
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,620
but I don’t regret.

322
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,260
<i>I know clearly all these
births and deaths in my memory.</i>

323
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,860
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

324
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>I know clearly all these
births and deaths in my memory.</i>

325
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,880
<i>I look back and taste the
aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

326
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,480
Jin Mi,

327
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,960
I won’t allow Mu Ci to hurt you.

328
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,440
Jin Mi.

329
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,680
Jin Mi.

330
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,640
Jin Mi.

331
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,020
Jin Mi.

332
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,660
I didn’t expect that it’s so hard for Jin Mi

333
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,280
to experience hardships this life.

334
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,120
Liu Ying.

335
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,120
She is here, too.

336
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,880
Presumably, she is also worried about
the safety of the second Prince.

337
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,360
We come for the same reason.

338
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,560
Affectionate people are everywhere in the world.

339
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
In my opinion,

340
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
the one infatuated with the second Prince

341
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,480
should be you.

342
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,160
We’d better solve the problem first.

343
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,640
Get it done quickly.

344
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,880
Qiang Huo,

345
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,560
are these their victory drumbeats?

346
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,700
This time after defeating Liangguo,

347
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,220
His Majesty signed an
armistice agreement with their monarch

348
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,580
that they’ll never fight again.

349
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,940
Good to hear that.

350
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,180
Good to hear that.

351
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,820
Qiang Huo,

352
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,740
when he comes back,

353
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,080
you must tell him personally that

354
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,080
I didn’t go back on my word.

355
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,220
Gosh.

356
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,280
I’m sorry.

357
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,460
Who are you?

358
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,740
Jin Mi.

359
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,360
Jin Mi, stand up.

360
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,120
Mu Ci, do you still
adhere to your wrong deed?

361
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
If I don’t kill her,
Mu Ci will never come back.

362
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,060
Kill her and you’ll never come back.

363
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,820
Jin Mi.

364
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,720
Jin Mi, quickly.

365
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,180
Jin Mi,

366
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,800
I’m sorry.

367
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,420
Forgive me.

368
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,880
I’m very happy to
have your company in this life.

369
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,880
If,

370
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,960
if there is a next life,

371
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,080
we’ll still be friends.

372
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,300
Wind blows gently.

373
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,560
Separated heaven and earth

374
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,620
are far from each other.

375
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,640
Qiang Huo.

376
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,640
Qiang Huo.

377
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,760
<i>Write a love letter as the starting.</i>

378
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,420
<i>A paragraph for ten thousands years
and one line for a thousand years.</i>

379
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,580
I’m very happy to have your company

380
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,140
for thousands of years.

381
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,380
If,

382
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,900
if there is a next life,

383
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,340
we’ll still be friends.

384
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,215
<i>I will wait for you there</i>

385
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:43,051
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>

386
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,470
<i>From the love letter, </i>

387
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:49,223
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>

388
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,809
<i>I will sing there,</i>

389
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:54,729
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

390
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:55,980
Rou Rou.

391
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,401
Rou Rou, is it you?

392
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,020
Rou Rou.

393
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,360
Jin Mi,

394
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,320
I’ve recalled the past, too.

395
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,100
I know

396
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,340
you brought my real body with you
all the time before.

397
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,420
You have done a lot of things.

398
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,280
You gave me

399
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,700
this life.

400
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,460
I have no regrets.

401
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,880
I mean it.

402
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,540
It seems that I really have to go this time.

403
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,560
Promise me.

404
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,640
Don’t be sad for me.

405
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,860
Rou Rou.

406
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:53,410
Rou Rou.

407
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:57,122
Rou Rou.

408
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:58,331
Rou Rou.

409
00:32:58,473 --> 00:32:59,416
Rou Rou.

410
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,000
Rou Rou.

411
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:06,790
<i>I will sing there,</i>

412
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:09,842
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

413
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,303
<i>From the love letter, </i>

414
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:16,182
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>

415
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:19,268
<i>and plant a red lotus...</i>

416
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:20,561
Rou Rou.

417
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,080
Why?

418
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,040
You’ve saved me twice,

419
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,380
but why can I never keep you?

420
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,860
Why?

421
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,220
Rou...

422
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,840
Mu Ci,

423
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,380
I told you if you hurt Jin Mi again,

424
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,240
you’ll be my enemy.

425
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,340
I won’t let you go today.

426
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,040
I will make everything clear.

427
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,500
Your Highness,

428
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,700
just let it go,

429
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,520
or you’ll be in a more dangerous situation.

430
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,820
Do you still care about my safety now?

431
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,420
Whatever.

432
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,420
You met Sui He.

433
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,820
Do you work for the Heavenly Empress?

434
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,820
Let me go,

435
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,600
or

436
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,600
kill me.

437
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,600
How did you become such a person?

438
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,580
Is our past

439
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,200
meaningless to you?

440
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,860
It seems that
it’s impossible for us to be together.

441
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,220
I shouldn’t have wild wishes any more.

442
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,280
Your Highness, since I knew that

443
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,860
the Demon Family is my swore enemy,

444
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,100
our memories

445
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,780
became meaningless to me long ago.

446
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,860
Are our feelings

447
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,640
really inferior to your blood feud?

448
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,980
Can’t we get away to a faraway place?

449
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,760
We just leave

450
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,620
other matters behind

451
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,240
and start all over, OK?

452
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,700
There are only you and me

453
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,540
in heaven and earth.

454
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,700
Your Highness,

455
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,640
under such a circumstance,

456
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,140
do you really think that I love you?

457
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,820
I can tell you now.

458
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,820
From the past to the present,

459
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,780
when you threw yourself at me
time and again,

460
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,180
I didn’t dare to refuse you

461
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,540
as I was just a bodyguard.

462
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,391
It’s worthwhile to exchange

463
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
a pleasure night with a princess

464
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,260
with a slap.

465
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,580
When we meet again some day,

466
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,300
if you still harm Jin Mi
and the Demon Family,

467
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,800
you’ll be my enemy

468
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,480
and I’ll show no mercy.

469
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,260
I have no choice,

470
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,500
but you can choose to

471
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,360
forget me.

472
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,960
It’s fine if I can
really let it go and forget you.

473
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,860
However, you know it well

474
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,880
I can never do it at all.

475
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,000
Cousin.

476
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Cousin.

477
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,380
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

478
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,680
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

479
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,820
<i>The flower in my heart has withered.</i>

480
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,800
<i>Time can’t go back.</i>

481
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,400
<i>I hope to wash away the vanity,</i>

482
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,920
<i>wipe the dust on me</i>

483
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,400
<i>and get drunk with you again</i>

484
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,100
<i>with a pot of clear wine.</i>

485
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,000
<i>Unwilling to get involved in troubles,</i>

486
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
<i>but things go contrary to the wish.</i>

487
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,860
Who killed her?

488
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,420
Immortals or demons
from somewhere who I don’t know

489
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,440
killed Saint Girl.

490
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,440
Originally, I wanted to fight back,

491
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,320
but they disappeared suddenly before me.

492
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,480
Investigate it.

493
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,960
Death can’t be reversed.

495
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,900
Please take care, Your Majesty.

496
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,800
Cousin.

497
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,680
Get out.

498
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,580
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

499
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,820
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

500
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,760
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

501
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:31,160
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

502
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,800
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

503
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,320
<i>I hope that time of all lives won’t wither again.</i>

504
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:52,100
<i>I look back and taste
the aftertaste of the wine in my heart.</i>

505
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,060
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>
