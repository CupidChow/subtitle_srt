1
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,120
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:18,160
"Episode 8"

3
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
Xuan Shou!

4
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,660
My son...

5
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:26,533
what has happened to you?

6
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,295
The Fire Immortal.

7
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,080
My sons had followed you
to fight with Qiong Qi.

8
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,950
When Chi Shou was back,

9
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,870
he became mentally unstable.

10
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,162
Xuan Shou has come back now,

11
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,861
he is also in a coma.

12
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,200
Yet, you remained unhurt.

13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,500
I believe in Supreme Immortals,

14
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,750
that's why I entrusted
my sons with you.

15
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,500
I can't believe you used
the chance to harm them.

16
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,035
Calm down, King of Yan City.

17
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,910
Xuan Shou is fine now.

18
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,838
I've transferred 500 years
of magical prowess to him yesterday...

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,600
and fed him a Golden Reinvigorating
Elixir from Supreme Lord Lao.

20
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,920
It'll put him to sleep...

21
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,087
for 3 days and 3 nights.

22
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,330
He'll wake up once he
regains his energy.

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,910
Fire Immortal,

24
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:10,096
you are indeed Heavenly Emperor's son.

25
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,750
You've inherited your silver tongue...

26
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,040
from your father,

27
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,727
passing the buck...

28
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,197
and regarding yourself
as a savior now.

29
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:21,723
What I said is true,

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,342
I never meant to pass the buck.

31
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,950
It is you who need to behave.

32
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,776
Heavenly Emperor is of noble status.

33
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,341
You can't blaspheme against him.

34
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,950
- You...
- Please don't be angry,

35
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,607
Demon Lord and the Fire Immortal.

36
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,790
With all due respect,

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,983
Demon Lord, it is unfair of you...

38
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,779
to keep pointing finger
at The Fire Immortal.

39
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,313
After all, he isn't the
one who hurt your sons,

40
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,611
but Qiong Qi is.

41
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,450
I think...

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,224
if you want to hold
someone accountable,

43
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,366
you should blame...

44
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,826
the one who let Qiong Qi off.

45
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,910
Qiong Qi was released by someone.

46
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,452
It is true?

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,440
Did you find any proof?

48
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,750
I did.

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,160
I noticed on the day
that Qiong Qi escaped,

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,710
the guards' duty roster of
Soul Suppress Palace...

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,300
was changed by someone.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
During guard mounting,

53
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,092
Soul Suppress Palace
was left unattended...

54
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:11,376
for half an hour.

55
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,580
Later, on the ground
of Soul Suppress Palace,

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,914
I discovered...

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,313
a trail which was left by dragging
the Melding Soul Cauldron.

58
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,117
The Melding Soul Cauldron
is a treasure of Heaven.

59
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:22,200
Only supreme immortals
from the Heaven Realm...

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,910
like the Fire Immortal is able to...

61
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,251
shrink it as wish...

62
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,428
for carrying.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,330
As Demon, we have no such power.

64
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,990
Moving the heavy cauldron
will surely leave...

65
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,731
a noticeable trail...

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,700
on the ground.

67
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:39,536
If Qiong Qi escaped by himself,

68
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,728
The Melding Soul Cauldron should have
been tipped over...

69
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:44,765
and hit the ground,
leaving only a mark...

70
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,619
and not a trail of dragging it.

71
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,207
So I'm sure...

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,150
that this disaster was caused...

73
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,095
by a distinguished person...

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,250
from the Demon Realm...

75
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,752
in order to provoke a dispute
among the six realms..

76
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,750
Did you...

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,240
release Qiong Qi?

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,180
Didn't your palms attack...

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,540
show that you'd affirmed...

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,370
it was done by me?

81
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,120
Why bother asking?

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,568
The Cauldron is protected
by the Demon Realm.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,470
Everyone in the six realms. knows it.

84
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,016
Tell me...

85
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,299
why did you abuse your power?

86
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,370
Doing such unrighteous
thing behind my back.

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,952
And making everyone think I'm evil.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,750
You and I are not unrighteous,

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
but the Heavenly Emperor is.

90
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,290
Since the beginning of the world,

91
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,921
the six realms, have been autonomous...

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,200
and working on the principle
of check and balance.

93
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,290
But after the war between the
Heaven and demon,

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,500
the Heaven Realm has risen to power...

95
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,477
and kept bullying us.

96
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,322
How could you...

97
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,250
put up with it?

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,370
The Heaven Realm is having
great standing now,

99
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,620
showing the tendency of
ruling the six realms..

100
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,104
Whereas we lead...

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,240
a carefree life...

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,730
without any restriction.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,116
Why do we have to...

104
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,460
take orders from
the supreme immortals...

105
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,790
of the Heaven Realm?

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,840
Even the small Floral Realm...

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,210
dares to challenge them.

108
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,550
We are not...

109
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,735
inferior to the Heaven Realm.

110
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,950
But why do we...

111
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,620
have to restrain ourselves...

112
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,700
and be blamed for everything?

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,120
I really can't...

114
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,250
swallow my anger.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,770
So I purposely released Qiong Qi.

116
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,654
Firstly, I want to...

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,120
take revenge for what has happened
at River of Unmindfulness.

118
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,795
Secondly, I want to find out the
real situation of the Heaven Realm.

119
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,687
It is a paper tiger now,

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,080
not as strong as before.

121
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,990
Except for the Fire Immortal, Xu Feng,

122
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,376
no one else can...

123
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,650
take charge.

124
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:23,928
Although Xu Feng is very powerful,

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,700
it is hard to achieve anything
without support.

126
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,000
As long as we get rid of him,

127
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,330
the Heaven Realm is
nothing to be feared.

128
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,620
I swear by my life that
I'll follow Demon Lord...

129
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,640
and help you to wipe
up the Heaven Realm...

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
to unite the six realms..

131
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,200
This needs further deliberation.

132
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,060
I'll have to plan it well.

133
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,022
Right.

134
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:07,875
"Palace of Gu City "

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,281
My lord,

136
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,290
how's it?

137
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,120
Everything is done as you instructed.

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,910
The demon doctor taking care of
the two princes is our people.

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,330
Chishou will be crazy forever.

140
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
As for Xuan Shou,

141
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,231
I'm afraid that he won't recover.

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Good.

143
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,030
You used a borrowed knife to kill,

144
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,611
stirring up conflict...

145
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,287
between the Heaven and Demon Realms,

146
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,789
and also eliminating the 2 silly sons
of Demon Lord.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,370
You killed 2 birds with a stone.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,020
Brilliant.

149
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
My lord,

150
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,000
did you hurt by Demon
Lord's palms attack?

151
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,650
I'll go and find the doctor now
to check for you.

152
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,950
There is no need.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,490
He won't sit on his throne...

154
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,500
as Demon Lord for long anyway.

155
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,490
Let him be arrogant for few more days.

156
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,660
Wait until...

157
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,660
I become the ruler of the six realms..

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,540
All the insults that I've received...

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,580
I'll definitely pay them back double.

160
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,580
The medicine is ready.

161
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,706
Come, drink it.

162
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,620
It is so bitter.

163
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,040
I know that it tastes bitter.

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,567
But the doctor has said,
good medicine always tastes bitter.

165
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,290
You'll get well after drinking it.

166
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,990
I've been cooking it all morning.

167
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,828
I don't want to drink.

168
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,705
Alright.

169
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,890
I'll have to grow a
Lingzhi for you then.

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
Don't move.

171
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:48,053
You're so well-behaved,

172
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,079
let me reward you with
a little red flower.

173
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,922
Come.

174
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,410
Come.

175
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,400
You've made such a mess of yourself...

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
cooking the medicine.

177
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,027
Don't ever go out...

178
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,603
with unkempt appearance...

179
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,165
and embarrass me.

180
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
I really think...

181
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,910
you've owed me...

182
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,990
a lot of food in previous life.

183
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
The first time we met,

184
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,120
you already fed me
with many weird things...

185
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,830
like honey,

186
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,160
Six Auspicious Treasures soup,
Lingzhi soup,

187
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:36,549
and that medicine just now...

188
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:38,500
which is bitter than
Chinese gold thread.

189
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,890
It tastes terribly bitter.

190
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
What?

191
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Raisin.

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,370
You made great contribution
in subduing Qiong Qi.

193
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,890
I'll ask my father to
give you credit for it.

194
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,659
Do you want to give me
something as reward?

195
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
Tell me.

196
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,040
How much magical prowess you want?

197
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,196
Eight hundred years?

198
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,017
Is 1000 years enough?

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,370
I'll transfer it to
you when we go back.

200
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:16,758
One thousand years.

201
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,854
Phoenix looks a bit stern...

202
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,290
but he is very nice.

203
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,515
What's wrong?

204
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,967
Are you too excited to say anything?

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,830
Do you know what you were doing?

206
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,830
I know.

207
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,118
Fox Fairy  said it‘s a "hug gratitude".
Hug gratitude.

208
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,767
How can I thank you without a hug?

209
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,080
What have I done wrong?

210
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,700
Uncle is always very light-minded.

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,580
It is true.

212
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,290
Princess.

213
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
You look good.

214
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,580
I guess you're better now.

215
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,160
Thank you, Princess.

216
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,370
I am fine.

217
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,830
I heard that you'll go back
to the Heaven Realm tomorrow.

218
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,450
Since Qiong Qi was captured,

219
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,889
I should go back and report it
to my father as soon as possible.

220
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:42,398
As for the kings of
Yancheng and Gucheng,

221
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,998
I'll have to trouble you
and King of Bian City...

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,172
to pay attention to them.

223
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,450
Don't worry.

224
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:49,117
If anyone wants to break
the truce pact...

225
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
and start a new war.

226
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,500
My father and I won't stand aside.

227
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Thank you.

228
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,150
I will go to your place
to pay my gratitude tomorrow morning.

229
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,746
Who told you to do so?

230
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,193
If you really want to thank us,

231
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:00,996
you should go back to
get some good rest.

232
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,170
After you recover,
we shall feast together...

233
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:06,289
and fight for 3000 rounds.

234
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,477
I dare not disobey your order.

235
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
We'll find a day to do it.

236
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,513
Rou Rou,

237
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,365
Don't worry.

238
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,540
I've avenged for you.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,660
I've locked up Qiong Qi.

240
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,600
Aren't I amazing?

241
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
Don't worry.

242
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,189
When I have enough magical prowess,

243
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,914
I'll go to Supreme Clarity Heaven
to find those Great Immortals...

244
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:38,203
and beg them to bring you back to life

245
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,727
Wait for me.

246
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,340
Jin Mi.

247
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,979
Jin Mi.

248
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,580
Rou Rou.

249
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,660
Is that you, Rou Rou?

250
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,990
Jin Mi.

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Jin Mi.

252
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm here.

253
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,177
Rou Rou.

254
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,462
Rou Rou.

255
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,950
Where are you, Rou Rou?

256
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,410
I'm here.

257
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,080
Jin Mi.

258
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,293
Jin Mi.

259
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,790
I'm here.

260
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,910
The Melding Soul Cauldron?

261
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,620
Rou Rou.

262
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,290
You...

263
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,200
Are you in the cauldron?

264
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,450
Jin Mi, I'm in the cauldron.

265
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,520
Let me out quickly.

266
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,360
Jin Mi.

267
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,830
Save me.

268
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,660
I'm in pain.

269
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,450
Jin Mi, save me

270
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,660
I'm in pain.

271
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,904
Jin Mi.

272
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,120
Save me.

273
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:08,144
Save me

274
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Jin Mi.

275
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,870
Hurry up and save me.

276
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,330
Rou Rou.

277
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Jin Mi.

278
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Can you help me to
remove the fire seal?

279
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,580
The heat puts me in pain.

280
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,429
I can't see anything.

281
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:23,770
It is burning me.

282
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,910
Let me help you.

283
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,869
Jin Mi.

284
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,072
Help me.

285
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,388
Let me help you.

286
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Jin Mi.

287
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,001
Are you okay?

288
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm sorry, Phoenix.

289
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,500
I didn't mean it.

290
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,580
I heard Rou Rou was
calling me just now.

291
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,000
I...

292
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,080
Rou Rou?

293
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,990
- Who is Rou Rou?
- The girl who was here just now.

294
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,750
She is my best friend.

295
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,410
I really heard her
calling me from the cauldron.

296
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,000
I also don't know...

297
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,950
how did I open it.

298
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,120
I have no idea what happened next.

299
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,450
Why Rou Rou was in there?

300
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,715
There is no one else in the cauldron.

301
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,344
It is Qiong Qi's mind-tricking spell.

302
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,500
It can bewitch you...

303
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,689
and transform into something
you desire the most.

304
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
Your haven't reached high attainments.

305
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,160
It is normal that you were fooled.

306
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,390
Luckily I put a fire seal on him.

307
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,284
Half of his power is sealed.

308
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able
to hold on until I came in.

309
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
So it is an illusion,

310
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,746
not Rou Rou.

311
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,990
I am so useless.

312
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,330
What's wrong, Phoenix?

313
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,870
What happened to your hand?

314
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,406
Probably hurt by Qiong
Qi's plague needles.

315
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,620
Plague needles?

316
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,947
Phoenix.

317
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,122
Phoenix.

318
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,680
Phoenix.

319
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,370
Plague needles.

320
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,080
Back then Rou Rou was also
hurt by it.

321
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,790
How can I save you?

322
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,213
Will growing a Lingzhi help?

323
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:08,842
What should I do, Phoenix?

324
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,668
It's alright.

325
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,870
Don't worry.

326
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,360
My cultivation can stop the
plague needles from hurting me...

327
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,050
for a while.

328
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,363
As long as you can find night...

329
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,606
Night, what?

330
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,750
What is it, Phoenix?

331
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Phoenix.

332
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,153
Phoenix.

333
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,405
Phoenix. Phoenix, what night?

334
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,700
Phoenix, what night?

335
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,200
You really fall for her.

336
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,580
I think you must have
read too many novels.

337
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm right.

338
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,580
You have feelings for her.

339
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,500
If not, why do you always
keep her by your side..

340
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,120
And order her to do this and that.

341
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,840
I think Jin Mi is not bad.

342
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,530
She is pretty and quite interesting.

343
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,540
Why don't you...

344
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,617
Even if you don't want to admit it,

345
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,220
you will realize one day...

346
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,920
that you can't live without her.

347
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,080
And you are willing to
do anything for her.

348
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,250
Even sacrifice your life.

349
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,680
This is what the mortals say,

350
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,500
"you miss a step...

351
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,450
and fall deeply in love".

352
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,250
Uncle was right.

353
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,170
What? Phoenix.

354
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,450
Phoenix!

355
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,790
How's he?

356
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,288
This is the initial symptoms
of plague needle poisoning

357
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,410
I am unable to cure him.

358
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,840
- Alright, you may leave.
- Okay.

359
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
Night Immortal.

360
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:48,217
King of Bian City.

361
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,408
- Night Immortal.
- Princess of Bian City.

362
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,580
How's Xu Feng?

363
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,160
I've asked Immortal Qi Huang here
to give him treatment.

364
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,748
It doesn't matter if
it is inner injury.

365
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,000
But the Fire Immortal was hurt...

366
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,607
by Qiong Qi's plague needles.

367
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,140
- Plague needles?
- Plague needles?

368
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,078
It's the deadliest poison
in the world.

369
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,540
Immortal, how is he?

370
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,659
The poison is under his skin.

371
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,870
A day later, it'll
enter his blood veins.

372
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,160
The next day his bone marrow.

373
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,533
And his lungs the day after.

374
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,302
If we don't have the
antidote after 3 days.

375
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,393
The second prince will lose
all his magical prowess.

376
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,590
Your Highness,
this is very serous.

377
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,910
Please inform Heavenly Emperor
as soon as possible.

378
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,040
I will tell him myself.

379
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,830
The priority now is to save Xu Feng.

380
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
Immortal, do you have any remedy?

381
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,910
Qiong Qi has been locked
up for very long.

382
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,960
There isn't much records
about the antidote in medical books.

383
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Oh right,

384
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,017
Phoenix told me this
before he fainted.

385
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,950
He said night...

386
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,120
Night... I don't really get it.

387
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,584
Night...

388
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:03,595
Night...

389
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,580
Is it the Night Rattan?

390
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,604
Yes.

391
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,910
I read it in an ancient book before.

392
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,038
It says that the Night Rattan is
an antidote to plague needle.

393
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,086
Great.

394
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,370
But where to find this Night Rattan?

395
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,300
The Night Rattan you said
does it grow in the Pure Fountain...

396
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,369
and 1 Night Rattan takes
10000 years to grow?

397
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,980
That's right. It is a sacred
plant of the Floral Realm.

398
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,040
But the flora and Heaven Realm
have long-standing feud.

399
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,466
If we want to persuade them...

400
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:31,348
to give the Night Rattan
to the second prince.

401
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:33,815
It won't be easy.

402
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,097
You know how to grow a Lingzhi.

403
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,253
Do you also know how to
grow the Night Rattan?

404
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,900
The Night Rattan has been hidden...

405
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,620
at Chuying Court in Floral Palace.

406
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,949
I've never seen it before.

407
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,250
No matter what,

408
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,040
we have to try our best.

409
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:48,780
I will go to the Floral Realm now.

410
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:50,894
No.
Fish Fairy, you don't know about this.

411
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:53,870
The chiefs of Floral Realm
are all very stubborn.

412
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,540
If you go there in a haste，
they won't give it to you.

413
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,620
What about you?
You are from the Floral Realm.

414
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,117
They'll listen to you, right?

415
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:01,362
I...

416
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,040
I'll get scolded if I go back.

417
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,574
I don't care.

418
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,200
Alright.

419
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:08,198
I'll go.

420
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,142
I'll get it no matter how.

421
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,660
I trust Fairy Jin Mi.

422
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,198
Let me go with you.
So that you have a backup.

423
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,204
Alright.

424
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,745
Immortal Qi Huang,

425
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:18,436
bring Kuang Lu back
to the Heaven Realm.

426
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,083
Xu Feng's life is tied to the peace
of the six realms..

427
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,500
To avoid causing an upheaval,

428
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,260
please don't tell anyone about it

429
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,450
I'll bear all consequences.

430
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,648
Alright.

431
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,094
I will obey your order...

432
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,700
and keep my lips sealed.

433
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,989
King of Bian City,

434
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,356
in order to maintain
long-term peace of the two realms,

435
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:43,238
I hope you will conceal it.

436
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

437
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,660
I know what is right to do.

438
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,309
Thank you, King of Bian City.

439
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,234
There's no time to lose.
You go first.

440
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,120
I'll bring Xu Feng along and wait
for you outside the Floral Realm.

441
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,447
Phoenix, you can rest assured...

442
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,123
that I'll definitely save you.

443
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,440
Wait for me.

444
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,170
Little One.

445
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Mr. Hu.

446
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,000
You still know to come back.

447
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,830
I miss you so much.

448
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,359
You also bring a pretty lady with you.

449
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,631
She is the Princess of Bian City
from the Demon Realm.

450
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Demon Realm?

451
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,340
Come.

452
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,070
- Come.
- What's it?

453
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,870
I've heard that those demons...

454
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:27,702
have long mouths and sharp fangs.

455
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,760
They eat the mortals...

456
00:24:29,877 --> 00:24:32,692
and the fairy-to-be like you.

457
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,050
They are even scarier than rabbits.

458
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,330
Are you sure
you are not eaten by them?

459
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:38,255
No.

460
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,990
You still have your nose, eyes,
arms and legs with you?

461
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,816
Yes, they are here.

462
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,290
Don't talk nonsense.

463
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:45,509
Old man,

464
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,990
Where did you hear these gossips?

465
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,879
Have you been to the Demon Realm?

466
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,079
Don't be angry.

467
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:53,376
We are here for something important.
Please ignore him.

468
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:55,322
I want to ask you.

469
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,450
Is Chief Peony in Floral Palace now?

470
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,260
You still want to see her?

471
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,036
She is still angry with you
for running away from the Water Mirror.

472
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:04,857
She is still angry?

473
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,870
Looks like she won't give
me the Night Rattan.

474
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,990
The Night Rattan?

475
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,450
You still dare to ask her for it?

476
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,670
I think you've lost your mind...

477
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,200
after going to the Demon Realm.

478
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,575
Why would Chief Peony
give you the Night Rattan?

479
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,040
Right.
There is no way she'll give it to me.

480
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,990
The Night Rattan.

481
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,250
It is a sacred plant
of the Floral Realm

482
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,669
For 1000 years,

483
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:33,951
I've only seen it once.

484
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,290
What do you want it for?

485
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,790
Oh right,

486
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,730
my transformation skills
have improved a lot.

487
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:42,765
I can transform into a table,
chair or water tank.

488
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:45,262
Maybe I can slip in there
and steal one.

489
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,836
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

490
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Little One,
don't do stupid thing.

491
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:53,337
"Chuying Court"

492
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,085
It is here.

493
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,330
Let me look for it.

494
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,311
There are so many.

495
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,473
How to find it?

496
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,790
Jin Mi.

497
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,990
Chief... Floral Fairy.

498
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,232
Jin Mi.

499
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,291
You left the Water Mirror
without permission.

500
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,885
And now trespass to Chuying Court.

501
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,451
Do you admit your wrongdoings?

502
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,330
Chief Peony.

503
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,350
I'm Liu Ying, the Princess of Bian City.

504
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,000
Nice to meet you, Chief Peony.

505
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,690
I wonder what brings
the Princess of Bian City here?

506
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:02,484
I came here...

507
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,870
to borrow your sacred plant,

508
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
the Night Rattan.

509
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,775
The Night Rattan?

510
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:09,774
The Fire Immortal
was hurt by plague needles...

511
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,230
when he was fighting with Qiong Qi.

512
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,078
Without the Night Rattan
acting as an antidote,

513
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,170
he'll lose all his magical
prowess in 3 days.

514
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,370
I beg you to give me
the Night Rattan...

515
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,894
to save the Fire Immortal's life.

516
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,021
I'll surely repay your
kindness in future.

517
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,570
The Fire Immortal is the supreme immortal
from the Heaven Realm.

518
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:26,335
Plague needles can only engulf
his magical prowess.

519
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:27,507
It won't take his life.

520
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,170
How to save his life then?

521
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,399
With the help of Heavenly
Emperor and Empress,

522
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,908
he'll only need to practise for few
thousand years to regain his prowess.

523
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,910
Furthermore, we has vowed..

524
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,290
That in million years,

525
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,120
we won't grow a plant
in the Heaven Realm...

526
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:40,945
or borrow a single herb to them..

527
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
So the Princess of Bian City,

528
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:44,008
you should leave now.

529
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,830
- You...
- Chief Peony,

530
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,370
Phoenix was hurt by plague needles
because of me.

531
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,650
Shut up.

532
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,160
We will talk about
your business later.

533
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,981
But Phoenix's business is my business.

534
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Chief Peony,

535
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,837
since I left the Floral Realm,

536
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,340
Phoenix has been taking care of me,
It is true.

537
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,408
Not only has he taught
me mental cultivation,

538
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,731
he has also saved me for three times.

539
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,760
The first time, at
Southern Heavenly Gate,

540
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,858
I would have devoured by Qiong Qi
if it weren't for him.

541
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,512
The second time, at Chiren Mountain,

542
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:10,885
he took a palm attack for me.

543
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,174
Now is the third time.

544
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,580
Qiong Qi's plague needles
were aimed at me...

545
00:28:14,617 --> 00:28:17,011
Enough! You ran away from
The Water Mirror Barrier...

546
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,410
and caused so much trouble.

547
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,005
Maids,

548
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,316
take her to the Water Mirror.

549
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,700
Ask Mr. Hu to watch over her.

550
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,500
Let her reflect on herself in there.

551
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,672
Chief Peony, just punish me,

552
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,078
it has nothing to do with Phoenix.

553
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,405
Please save him.

554
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:30,516
What are you doing here?

555
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,890
Take her away.

556
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,040
How senseless you are.
Quickly go away.

557
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,410
Chief Peony is so mad now.

558
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,675
Wait until she cools off.

559
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,420
- But...
- Jin Mi.

560
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't worry, Liu Ying.

561
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,335
I'll definitely find the Night Rattan.

562
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:42,457
Wait for me.

563
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,308
You are such a old fogy.

564
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:50,622
You're the leader of the Floral Realm,

565
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:52,164
yet you show no compassion at all.

566
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,870
Since there's no use begging you,

567
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,160
don't blame me for being rude.

568
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,200
I have to get the night
rattan today at all cost.

569
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,160
Chief Peony,
pardon me.

570
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,160
Don't push us too far, Princess.

571
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,160
We don't allow others
to act wildly here.

572
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,108
Let me go.
You're bullying the minority.

573
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:21,055
Have a one-on-one fight
with me if you dare.

574
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,520
Chief Peony is so hateful.

575
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:34,528
She set a barrier all of a sudden.

576
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,700
Jin Mi, where are you?

577
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,280
You have to get the Night Rattan.

578
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,465
Jin Min, have you
realized your mistakes?

579
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:46,981
Chief Peony, I know
that I am at fault.

580
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,898
I shouldn't break the rules
of the Floral Realm...

581
00:29:50,174 --> 00:29:52,254
and run away from the Water Mirror.

582
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,890
But you are also at fault in this.

583
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:57,618
You shouldn't vent your
anger at others...

584
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,790
because of my mistakes.

585
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,502
Have you not been teaching us...

586
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,810
to be kind?

587
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,000
I know.

588
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,790
The Flora and Heaven Realm
have conflicts.

589
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,240
But as the saying goes,

590
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:10,809
"Saving a life is better than building
a 7-storey pagoda."

591
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,250
Can you just watch
Phoenix lose his power?

592
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:15,064
Won't you feel shame?

593
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,060
Seems like you still don't know
what you've done wrong.

594
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
I...

595
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,080
It is my fault.

596
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,990
- I...
- Don't say this.

597
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
Since you've realized your mistake,

598
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,125
just correct what you've done wrong.

599
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,603
Give me the Night Rattan.

600
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,270
Saving Phoenix is more important.

601
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,660
Looks like I've spoiled you too much.

602
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,700
That's why you've become
so ill-mannered and willful.

603
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,342
From today onward,

604
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,320
you're grounded here
to repent for 1 month.

605
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,580
Chief Peony, please don't...

606
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,660
Chief Peony.

607
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,660
Save Phoenix,
ground me later.

608
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,587
It is fine if you
ground me for 2 months.

609
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,630
Who can save Phoenix?

610
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,840
Little One, meal time.

611
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,290
Jin Mi,

612
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,260
you didn't even touch your lunch.

613
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,760
Little One,

614
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,920
you want to go on a hunger strike?

615
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,260
I thought Chief Peony...

616
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,860
has a sharp tongue and soft heart.

617
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,231
Never have I expected...

618
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,700
that her heart is made of iron.

619
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,370
She just won't give it to me.

620
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,660
At worse...

621
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,376
at worse, I grow it myself.

622
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:42,172
Mr. Hu,

623
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,990
you're the oldest here.

624
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,970
Have you seen the Night Rattan before?

625
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,920
How does it look like?
Can you tell me?

626
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:51,015
Why do you care so much
about the Fire Immortal?

627
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,129
Do you have an ulterior
motive for him?

628
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,280
Right. I do.

629
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:58,778
What's wrong?

630
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,971
He has saved me for three times.

631
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,464
Without him,

632
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,340
I would have died long time ago.

633
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,730
You also know...

634
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,986
Rou Rou was killed by Qiong Qi...

635
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,740
because of me.

636
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,160
I don't want another friend of mine
die like this.

637
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,820
And also...

638
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,540
And also what?

639
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,240
Phoenix has promised...

640
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:22,487
to give me 1000 years
of magical prowess.

641
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:24,430
If he loses all his magical prowess,

642
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:26,283
I'll get nothing.

643
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,290
A thousand years.

644
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:30,944
Forget about it.

645
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,900
Since this lad has saved you three times,

646
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,020
I'll help you this time.

647
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,580
Thank you, Mr. Hu.

648
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:47,476
It is roughly like this.

649
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,870
The leaves are in green colour.

650
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,540
The flower is blue in colour.

651
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,930
It is on the northern
side of a mountain.

652
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,160
It only blooms once a millennium.

653
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,274
Jin Mi,

654
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,452
I've brought the water
of Pure Pond for you.

655
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
This..

656
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,544
Mr. Hu,
did you paint it wrongly?

657
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,750
I...

658
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,640
It is unlikely for me
to paint it wrongly.

659
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,990
Impossible.

660
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,310
I... I only saw it once.

661
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,309
- Once?
- Right.

662
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,450
Isn't there any record on books?

663
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,148
Right.

664
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,010
Jin Mi only said...

665
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,971
she will definitely
get the Night Rattan.

666
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,700
But she didn't say...

667
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,370
how to take it out.

668
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,410
Do you think she can make it?

669
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:21,234
Jin Mi is from the Floral Realm.

670
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,870
She is so smart.

671
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,780
She must have her way.

672
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,460
I think Jin Mi alone can't fight
Chief Peony's bad temper.

673
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,520
Why is his body temperature
decreasing so quickly?

674
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,870
His magical prowess is vanishing.

675
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:55,005
Please shield me.

676
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,132
Ice and fire are of different nature.

677
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,190
I can't transfer my
magical prowess to him.

678
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Therefore,

679
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,720
I use part of my magical prowess...

680
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,536
to heat up the aquatic
magical prowess.

681
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:23,614
And transfer the evaporated energy
to Xu Feng's body.

682
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,750
Going against the nature
will do you massive harm.

683
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,828
If your mind wanders,
it will take you over...

684
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,950
and backfire on you.

685
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,290
It is so urgent.

686
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,954
Xu Feng's life is more critical.

687
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,290
I can't care so much.

688
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,929
The Fire Immortal will be fine.

689
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
He will be fine.

690
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,660
Don't worry, Phoenix.

691
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,890
I'll save you.

692
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,127
Wait for me.

693
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,070
I will grow the Night Rattan for you.

694
00:37:06,544 --> 00:37:07,754
It is dawn already.

695
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,500
Today is the last day.

696
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,940
If I can't grow the plant...

697
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,870
No.

698
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,580
If I can't grow it, Phoenix...

699
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,300
Who can help Phoenix?

700
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,620
This is the Night Rattan.

701
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,285
I've made it.

702
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,130
Mr. Hu, Lian Qiao, I've made it!

703
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,920
Mr. Hu, come and take a look.
Is this the Night Rattan?

704
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,856
Right, it is.

705
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,590
Great!
I need to take it out at once.

706
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:03,792
I want to save Phoenix.

707
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
Hold on.

708
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,120
But Chief Peony has set
a barrier outside.

709
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,500
You're unable to go out.

710
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,870
- What should I do?
- Then...

711
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,410
Fine, I will just help you.

712
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,590
Alright...

713
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,580
You show up in your
true form later.

714
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,406
I'll take you out.

715
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,740
Mr. Hu, I knew it.

716
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,489
You're the one who treats me the best.

717
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,253
I'm back.

718
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,040
Jin Mi, you're finally back.

719
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,361
It's great.
We can save the Fire Immortal now.

720
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:42,578
Last night, the Night Immortal said...

721
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,198
that you'd definitely
get the Night Rattan.

722
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
I didn't believe him.

723
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,160
Thank you, Fairy Jin Mi.

724
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,290
Let him eat the Night Rattan now.

725
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,424
Phoenix.

726
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,960
It is great.
His magical prowess is coming back.

727
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:29,103
Really?

728
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,798
Come.

729
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,388
Phoenix.

730
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,080
Phoenix.

731
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,613
Phoenix.

732
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:53,290
Didn't I tell you?

733
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,250
My Page Boy
can't look unkempt.

734
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,080
You are awake.
It is so great, Phoenix!

735
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,700
You are finally awake.

736
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,160
What are you doing?

737
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,950
Chief Peony.

738
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,450
Nice to meet you, Chief Peony.

739
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,710
Thank you for saving my life.

740
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,010
You're wrong.

741
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,440
I didn't save you,
you don't have to thank me.

742
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,970
Jin Mi, come over here.

743
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,410
It is my fault, Chief Peony.

744
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,900
I shouldn't leave the Water Mirror
without permission.

745
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,307
It has nothing to do
with Lian Qiao and Mr. Hu.

746
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,190
You can just punish me.

747
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,700
Don't punish them.

748
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,760
Chief Peony, please don't
blame Fairy Jin Mi.

749
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:01,663
Don't blame her for this.

750
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,542
When I attained nirvana,

751
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,270
There was an accident and I entered
the Floral Realm by accident.

752
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,190
We ran into each other
so we got together.

753
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,120
I took her out of the Water Mirror.

754
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,740
And it led to all the
misunderstandings later.

755
00:41:14,937 --> 00:41:16,517
If you want to blame someone,

756
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,310
please just blame me.

757
00:41:18,663 --> 00:41:19,953
This is our business.

758
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,790
Outsiders are not
allowed to interfere.

759
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,830
Please behave yourself
and mind your speech.

760
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,990
I don't have any say
for other fairies,

761
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:29,167
only the fairies of the Floral Realm.

762
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,642
Even though you are very powerful,

763
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,630
don't you wish to
meddle in our affairs.

764
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,410
I have a clear conscience...

765
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,607
that I've never misconducted.

766
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,750
Please don't listen to the gossips.

767
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,180
I've really fallen...

768
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,542
for Fairy Jin Mi.
