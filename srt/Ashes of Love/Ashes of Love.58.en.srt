2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 58"

3
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:43,025
Mi,

4
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,925
I have an idea.

5
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,225
The floral chiefs treat you like their own daughter.

6
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,625
I want to invite them

7
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,475
to participate in our wedding ceremony

8
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,900
as the witnesses of our wedding.

9
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,875
It’s also sort of a way of repaying
them for their care and upbringing.

10
00:02:58,725 --> 00:02:59,625
What do you think?

11
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,875
It’s up to you.

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,550
Mi, I have something to show you.

13
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,075
Mi,

14
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,375
pick one piece of paper that is best-looking

15
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,275
for making wedding invitation cards.

16
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,000
You are Floral Immortal’s daughter.

17
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,075
So the floral chiefs

18
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,125
must like the paper you select.

19
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,775
Actually it’s all the same

20
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
to me.

21
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,575
Pick any one you like.

22
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,700
I think it’s more proper that you decide.

23
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,850
Since it’s for the wedding,

24
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,200
let’s select the red one,

25
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,275
which is for joyous events.

26
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,175
Go ahead.

27
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,325
This one.

28
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,425
I’m wondering whether I picked the right one.

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,850
As long as you like it,

30
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,325
it’s the best one.

31
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,675
It seems that

32
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,275
I picked the right one by luck.

33
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:31,900
My Lord.

34
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,000
How is Liu Ying?

35
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,975
She has been staying in the room
for three days without coming out

36
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,500
and drinking water.

37
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,600
I don't know how to persuade her.

38
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,050
I’ll check whether she is OK.

39
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,625
Xu Feng. Father.

40
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,100
Sorry to have made you worry about me.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,900
Don’t worry.

42
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,820
I won’t hurt myself,

43
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,775
because

44
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,075
I’m pregnant with Mu Ci’ s baby.

45
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,775
I will pass on this love.

46
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,575
Father, could you get me some food?

47
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,525
OK. OK.

48
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,100
I’ll go to ask the chefs

49
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,675
to prepare some of your favorite dishes right now.

50
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:24,620
Xu Feng,

51
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,420
this time King of Gu City must
be working in collusion with Run Yu.

52
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,060
That’s why he took away Mu Ci

53
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,380
and forced him to make
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow to kill you.

54
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,525
The battle between us
and Heaven Realm is inevitable.

55
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,400
Promise me that

56
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,600
you will let me take revenge for Mu Ci.

57
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,100
Xu Feng, eat some snacks.

58
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,375
What happened to you?

59
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,000
I am fine. You may leave.

60
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,175
If you are fine, why are you
hiding your hands behind your back?

61
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me check.

62
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,025
I told you. I’m fine.

63
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,950
What’s wrong with your ear?

64
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:52,875
It’s because of Jin Mi.

65
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,350
Last time she was determined
to kill me at the Cave of Jiu Ying.

66
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,400
If you hadn’t arrived in time,

67
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,350
my condition would be much worse now.

68
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,550
Xu Feng,

69
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,475
I have this ugly scar on my ear.

70
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,975
Will you dislike me for this?

71
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,700
Absolutely not.

72
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:14,825
That's good.

73
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:17,225
You have no idea.

74
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,850
I have always had nightmares since that day.

75
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,275
You must take revenge for me.

76
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,425
Alright. You may leave first.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,275
I have some official affairs to deal with.

78
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,900
OK then.

79
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,100
I’m going back now.

80
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,740
Go to bed early.

81
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,050
Glazed Pure Fire.

82
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,275
Xu Feng, you suspect that Sui He lied to you?

83
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,675
Last time, seeing that uncle was so serious,

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,150
actually I kind of believed what he said.

85
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:46,900
Yesterday

86
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,700
I accidentally found there was a scar on Sui He’s ear

87
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:51,600
caused by a Water Ripple Palm.

88
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,125
She said it was caused

89
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,200
by Jin Mi at the Cave of Jiu Ying.

90
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,375
But that scar

91
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,900
doesn’t seem new.

92
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
It’s very suspicious.

93
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,950
Water Ripple Palm.

94
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,100
It is the magic of which the
past Water Immortal was most proud

95
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,300
when he was alive, isn’t it?

96
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:08,475
If

97
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,425
the murderer who killed
Water Immortal and Wind Immortal

98
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,850
is really Sui He,

99
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,150
then can she use Glazed Pure Fire?

100
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,825
I went to the Cave of Jiu Ying just now.

101
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,775
And I found there were
some traces of Glazed Pure Fire.

102
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,525
The power is no worse than mine.

103
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,575
But Sui He has always been very delicate.

104
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,600
In addition, she spent a lot of
power nourishing my body.

105
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,550
How is it possible that

106
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,000
she has such pure power?

107
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,450
I do want to find out the
murderer who killed Water Immortal

108
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,750
and framed me.

109
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,425
But I don’t want to wrong the innocent people.

110
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,150
Let’s check it out.

111
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,050
No! What kind of person I will be if I do so?

112
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,375
It’s unfair for Mu Ci.

113
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,875
Xu Feng, don’t worry.

114
00:09:58,425 --> 00:09:59,625
No matter how good you are to Sui He,

115
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,175
Mu Ci is the best to me.

116
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,575
I have never cared about
other people’s gossip about me.

117
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,700
So you won’t do anyone wrong.

118
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,100
Stop.

119
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,750
Why are you stopping me?

120
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,425
I am a friend of Water Immortal.

121
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,475
His Majesty has issued the order that

122
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,550
outsiders should be forbidden to enter Xuanji Palace.

123
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:26,275
I am not an outsider. I’m...

124
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,900
Mi,

125
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,200
these two guys don’t let me in.

126
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,125
Don’t be rude to Immortal.

127
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:31,900
Stop.

128
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,325
Immortal.

129
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,350
He is my friend. Let him in.

130
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,500
But what about His Majesty’s order?

131
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,225
If His Majesty blames you,

132
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,275
let him come to me.

133
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,700
Yes.

134
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,125
Let's go.

135
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,180
"Xuanji Palace"

136
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,300
Run Yu is really getting
more and more narrow-minded.

137
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:03,775
He even forbids me to see you.

138
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,500
I think he is afraid that you may run away with me.

139
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,650
Mi,

140
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,250
are you really so crazy that you are
going to become the Heavenly Empress?

141
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,050
Let me remind you.

142
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,850
To be a Heavenly Empress,

143
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,925
one has to be particularly talented.

144
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,750
You are kind of mediocre.

145
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,775
Not that I underestimate you.

146
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,800
Mediocre?

147
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,350
I got it.

148
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,425
You are suggesting that

149
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:32,650
my power is weak.

150
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,825
No. No.

151
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,350
I know

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,125
your power is much stronger than before.

153
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,400
But think about it.

154
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,250
Among all the previous Heavenly Empresses,

155
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:47,750
which one is not ruthless and sinister?

156
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,650
And which one is not a wolf in sheep's clothing?

157
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,250
I don’t think you have any of these features.

158
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,450
Not to mention being the future Heavenly Empress,

159
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,125
you can’t even compare with Sui He

160
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,825
in terms of these features.

161
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,650
Don't be sad.

162
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,125
I didn’t mean to belittle you.

163
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:10,800
I mean

164
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,625
you can’t bear comparison with her

165
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,000
in terms of being sinister and adept at scheming.

166
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,700
You are right.

167
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,925
Compared with Sui He,

168
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,625
I’m too stupid.

169
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,150
I’m so stupid that

170
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:28,675
I took revenge for my father on the wrong person.

171
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,225
I’m so stupid. Right?

172
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,425
The sea of suffering is boundless,
but you can see the bank when you turn back.

173
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,200
How about running away?

174
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:40,200
If you would like to have affairs,

175
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,300
I will take you away.

176
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Again.

177
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,350
Don’t talk nonsense.

178
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:47,975
Run Yu has also done much for me.

179
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,650
I won't change my mind anymore.

180
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,725
Then here’s a question.

181
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,600
Do you love him?

182
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,425
If you really marry him,

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
then there will be no way back.

184
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:21,525
Your Majesty.

185
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,950
Why did she pick the green one?

186
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,550
She shouldn’t be color-blinded like this.

187
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,700
Is it because she is absent-minded?

188
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,850
Or is it because she bears a grudge against me

189
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,700
that she deliberately picked
this paper to satirize me?

190
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,775
Or is there some implied meaning?

191
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,425
Your Majesty, after hearing what you said,

192
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,700
I realize that Water Immortal has indeed been

193
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,000
a little bit strange these days.

194
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:50,625
What happened?

195
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Not long ago, Water Immortal

196
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,775
planted phoenix flowers at Qiwu Palace.

197
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,375
But those flowers were gray.

198
00:13:58,925 --> 00:13:59,650
Really?

199
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:01,825
I saw that with my own eyes.

200
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,350
How come she can’t distinguish colors?

201
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,175
I see.

202
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:10,525
Kuang Lu, you may leave.

203
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,675
Yes, Your Majesty.

204
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,650
Mi, you came just at the right moment.

205
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,400
Kuang Lu brought a dish of
pomegranate cake just now.

206
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,975
I have had breakfast.

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,050
So you may try it for me.

208
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,575
Your Majesty,

209
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,025
Kuang Lu prepared it for you.

210
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,900
So enjoy it yourself, Your Majesty.

211
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,575
Actually,

212
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:50,475
Kuang Lu

213
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
has been with you for a long time.

214
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,150
She

215
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,100
is really very nice.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,550
I won’t say no if you take concubines.

217
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,075
You can take concubines as many as you like.

218
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,450
Thank you for being so considerate to me.

219
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:07,125
Mi,

220
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,100
frankly speaking,

221
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,875
I’m not afraid that you don’t care about me.

222
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,125
I’m afraid that you care about
me like this occasionally.

223
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,225
Xu Feng.

224
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,875
Xu Feng,

225
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,125
what happened to you?

226
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,325
Why is your body so cold?

227
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,550
Get out.

228
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,925
What happened, Xu Feng?

229
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,775
Don’t tell anyone else about this.

230
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,180
Our wedding day is around the corner.

231
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,940
But your condition...

232
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,825
What happened exactly?

233
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:10,025
Tell me, okay?

234
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,820
There is nothing wrong with me.

235
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
I will be OK soon.

236
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,975
The Golden Elixir.

237
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,100
Someone must have played
a trick in the Golden Elixir.

238
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:22,875
Wait a moment.

239
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,125
Kuang Lu,

240
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,275
you came just at the right moment.

241
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I just recalled that Immortal Tai Si

242
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,875
had mentioned your marriage on that day.

243
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:44,450
I’m thinking about...

244
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,000
I have made my attitude toward this clear that day.

245
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,575
Why did you mention this matter again, Your Majesty?

246
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,400
There are many outstanding fairies in Heaven Realm.

247
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,400
No matter who you like,

248
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,350
I will definitely arrange a wonderful marriage for you.

249
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:05,700
Your Majesty, why do you insist on this matter?

250
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Are you going to drive me away?

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,475
I know what you want, Your Majesty.

252
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:18,775
I also know clearly the result.

253
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,200
But I don’t want anything else.

254
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,800
I just want to stay with you all the time, Your Majesty.

255
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:26,925
Kuang Lu.

256
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:27,625
Your Majesty,

257
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,450
I will assume that I have never heard

258
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,575
what you said today.

259
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:38,950
After I step out of this room,

260
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,225
I will forget everything about this matter.

261
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,700
Do you agree, Your Majesty?

262
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:56,675
I will regard your silence as permission.

263
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:04,875
Good night,

264
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:06,650
Your Majesty.

265
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,925
I’m leaving now.

266
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,625
It seems

267
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,500
I can't never forget you.

268
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,380
Why did you trespass Heaven Realm at this time?

269
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,780
What do you want?

270
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,600
A straightforward person
does not resort to insinuations.

271
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,700
You must know clearly why I’m here.

272
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,060
Your mind is hard to read.

273
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,940
I really don’t know why you are here.

274
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,275
If you haven’t done anything that makes you guilty,

275
00:20:32,975 --> 00:20:34,550
why did you close the door and the windows.

276
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,950
I just want to save your face.

277
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,675
I have only one question.

278
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,775
Did you play a trick

279
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:42,400
in the Golden Elixir of Lord Lao?

280
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,725
I was wondering what it is about.

281
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:00,800
It turns out to be this trivial matter.

282
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:11,675
I just removed a herb that can
provide internal heat from that elixir.

283
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,025
Just as I expected.

284
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
In the outside world, people say

285
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,900
the Heavenly Emperor is
deep in love with Water Immortal.

286
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,150
But they don’t know

287
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,625
the Heavenly Emperor even lies to
his loved one and makes use of her.

288
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,850
You knew that Xu Feng still had one piece of soul.

289
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,220
You also knew that Jin Mi would
definitely use the Golden Elixir

290
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,540
to save Xu Feng’s life after she got it.

291
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,550
You know his body constitution is fire
by nature and he’s afraid of coldness.

292
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:35,800
So you deliberately removed the heat of the medicine,

293
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:40,000
making him suffer from
the autophagy caused by the elixir.

294
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,400
I guess Water Immortal still does not know

295
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,350
how perfectly she is made use of by you.

296
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,650
If someone mentions this to her at this time...

297
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,450
You spoke in a such a frank way.

298
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,625
Have you told that demon

299
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,725
that you are the murderer
who killed the past Water Immortal,

300
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:11,350
and that his life was not saved by you?

301
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,900
Nowadays,

302
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:16,500
Xu Feng’s power is getting
stronger and stronger day by day.

303
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Even he himself doesn’t care about

304
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,050
this trivial pain of autophagy.

305
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,950
You are just wasting your
energy in unnecessary worry.

306
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,925
What if Xu Feng knows his life was saved by Jin Mi?

307
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,450
If Jin Mi hadn’t killed him with one deathly stab,

308
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,525
how would his soul have been destroyed?

309
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,750
If Jin Mi knows that

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,875
you had already known

311
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,500
Xu Feng was not the murderer

312
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,475
who killed Water Immortal,

313
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,925
but you kept this from her and misled her,

314
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
what will she do?

315
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,250
I advise you not to be silly.

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
You are finally going to marry him soon.

317
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,250
If this fact is made public,

318
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,200
aren’t you afraid that your dream will be shattered?

319
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,400
If you tell me which herb you removed from that elixir,

320
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:01,775
I will forget everything

321
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:05,100
that happened today the moment I leave.

322
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,975
Would you dare to believe me

323
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:09,525
if I tell you?

324
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:11,525
If you still refuse to tell me,

325
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,125
then I will take a risk

326
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,250
and fight against you to the end.

327
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,775
You are much more confident

328
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:20,825
after getting the power of
the abandoned Heavenly Empress.

329
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,650
How do you know that?

330
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,550
When I saw the scar that is caused
by the Water Ripple Palm on your ear,

331
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:30,850
I became suspicious of you.

332
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,800
After that, Tu Yao lost all her power overnight.

333
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:37,750
So I realize almost the whole truth.

334
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,100
Now

335
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,700
Jin Mi and her fellows have also known

336
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,700
you are the real murderer
who killed Luo Lin and Lin Xiu.

337
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,650
But I guess

338
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,125
Xu Feng didn’t believe Jin Mi’s words at that time.

339
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,175
If now

340
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,125
I submit the evidence to Xu Feng,

341
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,825
what will he do?

342
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,750
You...

343
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,600
I have an advice for you.

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,125
Keep silent about this

345
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,475
and marry him without bringing any troubles.
It’s the right choice for you.

346
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,175
With his protection,

347
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:14,825
you can still be alive for the time being.

348
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,850
If someday you are at my control...

349
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,200
Everyone knows

350
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,000
I have swore with the name of immortal

351
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:25,450
to take revenge on the one
who killed Water Immortal’s father.

352
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,775
It turns out that you want to
make use of me to hold Xu Feng

353
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,000
so as to make it impossible
for them to be together again.

354
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:35,150
You are really good at taking
all means that are available.

355
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:36,900
You, too.

356
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,575
Bye. I’m not seeing you off.

357
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:57,850
Come here.

358
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,175
Burn the incense and sweep the floor.

359
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,925
Mi.

360
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,500
Mi,

361
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,325
it’s very late now.

362
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,000
Why haven’t you gone to bed?

363
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,575
Your Majesty,

364
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,325
what else do you want me to do for you?

365
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,425
Mi, what are you talking about?

366
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:30,925
I don’t get it.

367
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,225
I heard the whole conversation

368
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:35,725
between you and Sui He just now.

369
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,450
What else do you want me to do for you?

370
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:41,025
Or

371
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,800
who else do you want me to kill for you?

372
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:48,875
Mi,

373
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,050
Listen.

374
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,050
Don't talk to me like this.

375
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,900
I’m scared.

376
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,600
The one who should be scared is me.

377
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,775
I have been made full use of.

378
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,100
Every inch of me

379
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
has been made use of by you.

380
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,175
I’m worthless now.

381
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,225
Now let me go.

382
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,475
Really,

383
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,025
I beg you.

384
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,850
Please let me go, OK?

385
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:21,950
Mi,

386
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,780
look at me.

387
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,380
Look at me carefully.

388
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,850
I love you.

389
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,325
I really love you.

390
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,475
Don't be scared of me. Don't leave me.

391
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:32,050
You don't love me at all.

392
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,525
From the very beginning,

393
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,075
you only love yourself.

394
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,750
You lied to me, saying that you love me.

395
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:40,250
You lied to my daddy, saying that you love me.

396
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,550
You lied to the floral chiefs, saying that you love me.

397
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,150
You lie to all the people in the world,
saying that you love me.

398
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:46,700
You keep lying,

399
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
and then you even make yourself believe it’s true.

400
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,825
But you don't love me at all.

401
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
You don't love me at all.

402
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,975
It’s not true.

403
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:56,600
Listen.

404
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,300
You can feel it.

405
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,875
You feel it, right?

406
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:02,250
You can feel that I love you. Right?

407
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,275
Even if I am stupid,

408
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:05,075
I’m not so stupid as to believe you.

409
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,625
At the beginning, you approached me

410
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
just because I was a close friend of Xu Feng.

411
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,150
You wanted to know your enemy’s situation.

412
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,125
Later,

413
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,525
you suspected that I was Water Immortal’s daughter.

414
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,975
When you saw I created hailstorm

415
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,075
at the birthday banquet of Heavenly Empress,

416
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,825
you were more certain that
I was Water Immortal’s daughter.

417
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,225
And on that day,

418
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,275
when my daddy took me
outside the Northern Heavenly Gate,

419
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,850
you saw my daddy.

420
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,475
But you pretended not to see him. Why?

421
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,050
You took advantage of my
ignorance about love at that time,

422
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:45,700
and induce me to say that I like you.

423
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,075
Your purpose was to make my daddy believe that

424
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,275
I like you.

425
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:51,450
For you were afraid that

426
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,400
my daddy may cancel our engagement.

427
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,675
You were afraid that you may lose

428
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,200
the support from my daddy.

429
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,500
You wanted my daddy to fight
together with you against Xu Feng.

430
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,475
Am I right?

431
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,525
You let me go to the Qiwu Palace.

432
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,125
You let Xu Feng come to see me.

433
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:11,650
You just wanted me to pin down him.

434
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,250
You gave me Beast of Dreams,
because you wanted to spy on me.

435
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:21,525
You have already known who killed my daddy.

436
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,550
But you,

437
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:26,375
you are not only a master of chess playing.

438
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,400
You are more of a gambler.

439
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,275
On our wedding day,

440
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,925
you made a bet.

441
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:35,975
You bet

442
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,600
that Xu Feng would break in.

443
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,250
You bet that I would kill Xu Feng.

444
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,975
Right?

445
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:46,975
There were no one hundred thousand troops at all.

446
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:49,025
You had only one stake.

447
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,675
And the stake was me.

448
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,575
I was just one of your chips.

449
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,675
I was just one of your chips.

450
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,750
You are too horrible.

451
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,025
How did you make it?

452
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,180
You advance gradually and entrench yourself
at every step without making any mistake.

453
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:13,100
You can make use of people all over the world.

454
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,875
But

455
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:17,250
you can also make them think

456
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,850
you are the most innocent and

457
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,225
the kindest person in the world.

458
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,525
It's you

459
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:26,250
who made me kill the person I love most.

460
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,200
It’s you who made me kill phoenix.

461
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,875
It's you who made me kill the person

462
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,650
who loved me most.

463
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:40,200
Now you are the Heavenly Emperor.

464
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,775
You have got everything you want.

465
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,875
All the people in the six realms admire you.

466
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,150
What else do you want?

467
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,225
All I want is phoenix.

468
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,925
Why don’t you allow me to be with him?

469
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,350
Nowadays phoenix doesn’t love me anymore.

470
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,125
He hates me.

471
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,050
Now he is going to marry the person

472
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,875
who killed my father.

473
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:09,750
Congratulations!

474
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,150
You have got everything you want.

475
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,550
Please.

476
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,500
Let me go, please.

477
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,375
Please let me go, okay?

478
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:20,750
Mi,

479
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:22,950
how can I let you go?

480
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,525
Mi, how can I let you go?

481
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,625
I love you.

482
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,100
I love you so much.

483
00:30:32,175 --> 00:30:33,475
I love you so much that I can’t control myself.

484
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,275
I did all these just for you.

485
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,550
I have changed like this because of you.

486
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,575
I saw your dream,

487
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,000
in which you and he,

488
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:53,300
you two were making love.

489
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,525
Do you know I felt at that time?

490
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,600
I was anxious to destroy my own soul at that time.

491
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,225
I had never asked for anything

492
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,450
until I met you.

493
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:09,900
It's you

494
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,000
who made me put off all defenses.

495
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,875
You make me feel the long-desired warmth.

496
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,575
You are the only one.

497
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,075
You are the only one of whom I will never let go.

498
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,900
According to all those experiences,

499
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,350
if I want to protect my loved ones,

500
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:29,600
I have to be patient

501
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:32,150
and I have to be strong enough

502
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,175
so that all people submit themself to the rule of me.

503
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:36,475
I made it.

504
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,600
Mi,

505
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:40,300
you are with me finally.

506
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,725
Although you went to Demon Realm
to meet him many times,

507
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,400
I can ignore this fact

508
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
as long as you stay with me.

509
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:49,400
Later,

510
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,225
you went there less frequently.

511
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:54,475
You even,

512
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,125
you even agree to marry me.

513
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:00,850
Do you know how happy I was at that time?

514
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,225
I was even thinking that

515
00:32:04,175 --> 00:32:05,775
I would even be willing to

516
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,200
quit being the Heavenly Emperor

517
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,575
as long as you marry me

518
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:11,750
and we can be together all our life.

519
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,575
Enough.

520
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:15,675
You don’t know

521
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:16,700
what is love at all.

522
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,575
You never deserve to be loved.

523
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:24,475
Please don't defile love anymore.

524
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,575
From now on,

525
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,575
I will never believe

526
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:33,150
what you say again.

527
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,125
Mi,

528
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,250
I know I did wrong.

529
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,125
I really know I did wrong.

530
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,150
It’s OK that you don’t believe me.

531
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:45,200
It’s OK that you don’t love me.

532
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,000
It’s also OK that you hate me.

533
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,425
But

534
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:53,375
you can never leave me.

535
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,800
You didn’t do anything wrong.

536
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:57,325
I was wrong.

537
00:32:59,275 --> 00:33:00,025
I was wrong.

538
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,075
I was way too wrong.

539
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,825
This fish scale is so beautiful and unique.

540
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,900
It is the loong scale.

541
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,550
Fairy Run Yu, you

542
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,075
gave me such a precious gift.

543
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,650
I will definitely keep it safe.

544
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,700
I will keep it safe.

545
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:27,850
In the future,

546
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,975
if you marry me,

547
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,350
you will have to suffer from some unjust treatments.

548
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,650
Would you mind, Fairy Jin Mi?

549
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,750
Not at all.

550
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,925
I think it’s quite cost-effective.

551
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,050
Fish Fairy, you are really an exceptional
man of tremendous promise in Heaven Realm.

552
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,650
I think your future is very promising.

553
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,325
Mi likes playing about.

554
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,500
So I used the mist to make a rainbow bridge.

555
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,250
Whenever and wherever Mi is,

556
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,625
she can always see the way home

557
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,200
when she looks up.

558
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:53,625
I ask for few things in my life.

559
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,625
I just want you to love me a little bit more every day,

560
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,425
day by day, month by month

561
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:59,125
and year by year,

562
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,300
till the end of my life.

563
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay?

564
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:46,700
Mi,

565
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:49,375
I was wrong,

566
00:34:51,775 --> 00:34:53,400
but I don't regret for what I have done.

567
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,975
Immortal.

568
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,500
-Get out of my way.
-No, Immortal.

569
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,650
Immortal. Immortal.

570
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,750
I will give you the last chance.

571
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,575
Tell me or not?

572
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,575
You can’t throw this.

573
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:16,800
It is the Bayi Pill that Supreme Lord Lao

574
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
has refined for eighty-one days.

575
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,750
Hurry.

576
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,325
Water Immortal,

577
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,375
please don’t throw it.

578
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:24,925
Keep cool.

579
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,475
Don’t be impulsive. Don’t be impulsive.

580
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:27,325
OK. Lord Lao,

581
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:28,275
I have questions for you.

582
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,875
Don’t lie to me again.

583
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,900
What trick did you play
in the Jiuzhuan Golden Elixir?

584
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,775
Which herb was removed from that elixir?

585
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,700
Well,

586
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:36,750
I...

587
00:35:36,975 --> 00:35:37,400
Alright.

588
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,025
No, please.

589
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:39,875
Alright. Alright.

590
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,325
Please don’t.

591
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:42,025
I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you.

592
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,000
There was no herb missing in the Golden Elixir.

593
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,275
Instead, there was a herb named
cynanchum atratum added to it.

594
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,575
Cynanchum atratum is loaded with cold yin energy,

595
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,125
which is in conflict with
Fire Immortal’s body constitution.

596
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:58,325
Therefore, Fire Immortal suffers from
the autophagy caused by the Golden Elixir

597
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,200
after eating it.

598
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,750
Lord Lao, I didn’t expect that

599
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:05,750
you had also been also involved in this matter.

600
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:08,625
I feel ashamed.

601
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,300
I really feel ashamed.

602
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:14,325
It was Heavenly Emperor’s idea,

603
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,525
but you worked in collusion with him.

604
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,700
If this thing is made public,

605
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,525
how can you keep your authority in Heaven Realm?

606
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,150
You are right, Water Immortal.

607
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,850
To be honest,

608
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,875
I have been in unease these days.

609
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,400
It’s not too late to make up for it.

610
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,450
Lord Lao, I hope

611
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,275
you can tell me what’s the remedy.

612
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:40,250
Don’t let His Majesty

613
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,725
hold on to his wrong course anymore.

614
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,375
Hairy Feather can remove the
cold yin energy of cynanchum atratum.

615
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,375
Hairy Feather?

616
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,225
Is it the herb named Hairy Feather of Floral Realm,

617
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:48,900
which grows once in ten thousand years?

618
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes, it is.

619
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,625
Hairy Feather is very delicate.

620
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:53,750
If it leaves the place where it grows,

621
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:57,750
it will be spoiled within three days.

622
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,400
Why are you here?

623
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:08,575
Let me go.

624
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:10,425
Don’t hold on to the wrong course anymore.

625
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,550
Let go of me.

626
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,075
Let go of me.

627
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,075
Let go of me.

628
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:19,000
Let go of me.

629
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,225
What are you doing?

630
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,800
Don’t move.

631
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,275
What?

632
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:25,025
What do you want?

633
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:26,325
Let go of me.

634
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,450
Mi,

635
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,575
listen.

636
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,750
I will never let go of you.

637
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,800
The wedding ceremony will be held

638
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,775
as scheduled.

639
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,850
Are you crazy? You...
