00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 59"

3
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,800
Let go of me.

4
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,970
Let go of me.

5
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,070
What are you doing?

6
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,620
Don’t move.

7
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,050
What?

8
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,900
What do you want?

9
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,150
Let go of me.

10
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,400
Mi, listen.

11
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,600
I will never let go of you.

12
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,470
The wedding ceremony will be held

13
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,720
as scheduled.

14
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,920
Are you crazy? You...

15
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,350
Mi,

16
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,420
I will never ever let you leave me.

17
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,720
Xu Feng, you are in low spirit.

18
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Haven’t you made the decision?

19
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,620
So many years have passed.

20
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,970
Xu Feng, don’t you want to

21
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,670
find out the truth?

22
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,220
Don’t you want to know

23
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,620
who is the culprit

24
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,270
who killed Water Immortal
and cast the blame on you,

25
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,775
making you suffer a lot?

26
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,300
Sometimes the closer you are to the truth,

27
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,050
the more dreadful you will feel.

28
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:37,550
Xu Feng, so you are clear in your mind.

29
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,575
In Heaven Realm,

30
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,900
I used to hate injustice like poison

31
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:48,300
and distinguish things as either black or white.

32
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,025
In order to find out the
assassin who intended to kill me

33
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
and cast the blame on Run Yu,

34
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,500
I also took some means.

35
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:58,175
But I didn’t expect that

36
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,075
behind that case,

37
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,650
there were so many people involved.

38
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:06,325
Yan You,

39
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:07,875
Rat Fairy,

40
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,025
Su Li, Water Immortal

41
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,825
and even the entire Water
Family in the Dongting Lake,

42
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:14,650
they all were involved.

43
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,025
Even my father and my mother were also involved.

44
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,575
Even if I find out the truth,

45
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,450
what benefit will it bring about?

46
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,075
Thee husband and the wife quarreled.

47
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,250
Brothers fought against each other.

48
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,780
The father and the son became enemies.

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,860
Endless revenges...

50
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,075
In that shocking gamble in Heaven Realm,

51
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,725
nobody is the winner.

52
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,300
But the misdeed is the misdeed.

53
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,725
Someone must pay for his or her misdeeds.

54
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:52,500
Water Immortal and Wind Immortal were killed.

55
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,200
And you are wronged.

56
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,825
If you let the real murderer get away,

57
00:05:57,575 --> 00:05:59,950
I am afraid that she will take chances

58
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,200
and kill more innocent people.

59
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,775
You are right.

60
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,550
I’m too soft-hearted.

61
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:08,675
No.

62
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,550
you can’t see it clearly because
you are involved in this matter.

63
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,725
She has always been affectionate to you.

64
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,650
I know it’s really hard

65
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,950
to make the decision.

66
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,025
But I’m really very sorry to ask you for this favor,

67
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,100
which may bring you troubles and inconvenience.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,000
I really feel guilty in front of
Mu Ci and King of Bian City.

69
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,500
You regarded me as an outsider again.

70
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,575
Mu Ci and my father
have always been open-minded.

71
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,375
They don’t see things at superficial level.

72
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:35,725
Xu Feng, don’t worry.

73
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,540
What's more,

74
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,740
the fake one can't turn into the true one.

75
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,925
This is a golden rule especially in Demon Realm.

76
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:42,775
Not everyone can pass the test

77
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,175
of the heart-testing stone.

78
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,325
Xu Feng,

79
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:55,625
after our wedding,

80
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,620
I will manage to cure your
autophagy pain caused by the Golden Elixir

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,725
even if I have to fight against
all the people of Heaven Realm.

82
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,975
Your Highness, you are so beautiful.

83
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:04,625
Nobody can compare with you.

84
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,400
Tomorrow you must pass the heart-testing stone,

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,325
proving that you and my Lord are a perfect match.

86
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,525
What heart-testing stone?

87
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,025
Xu Feng,

88
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,300
don’t blame me.

89
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,250
I believe that we love each other.

90
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,300
But love

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,900
can't stand any test.

92
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,325
Lord Puchi.

93
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,900
How come even the summon spell
doesn’t work now?

94
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,775
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

95
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,025
You got the wrong person.

96
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,650
There is no Heavenly Empress here.

97
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,675
Today is the wedding day of His Majesty and you.

98
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,500
You deserve this title.

99
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,900
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

100
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,875
In all over the six realms,

101
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,975
people like His Majesty who is
so loving and faithful are really rare.

102
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,250
I agree.

103
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:56,075
How can there be such a man in this world

104
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:00,700
who is so good to a girl?

105
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,125
If any,

106
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,425
it’s just an illusion.

107
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,000
The so-called infatuation

108
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,500
is just fake.

109
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,875
If you don’t have that experience in person,

110
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,700
how can you know the bloodiness

111
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,075
behind the gentleness?

112
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,075
The auspicious moment is coming.

113
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,500
Please dress up, Your Majesty.

114
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,200
If you want to be the Heavenly Empress

115
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,875
then go ahead.

116
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,525
In short,

117
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:31,650
I won't be the Heavenly Empress.

118
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,725
Your Majesty.

119
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,600
What's going on here?

120
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:42,800
Your Majesty.

121
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,025
It’s OK.

122
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,300
You may leave.

123
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,800
I want to talk to Water Immortal alone.

124
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:50,900
Yes, Your Majesty

125
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,000
Everything is OK. You may go.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go. Go. Go.

127
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,375
I’m here now.

128
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,775
Why don’t you welcome me yourself?

129
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:19,500
My beauty,

130
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,025
you shouldn’t be so indifferent to me

131
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:28,025
by taking advantage of my love for you.

132
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,550
My beauty,

133
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,775
you should know that

134
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,075
Heavenly Emperor can take many concubines

135
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,750
except the Heavenly Empress

136
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,325
My beauty,

137
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,575
look at me carefully.

138
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:45,375
Is there any differences?

139
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,125
You are so stubborn.

140
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,325
Then let me train you,

141
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,225
My beauty.

142
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,050
Okay.

143
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,725
Your Majesty,

144
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,075
let me serve you well.

145
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,200
Have you played enough, Your Majesty?

146
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,425
So you have already found it’s me.

147
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,375
Of course.

148
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,850
Do you think your acting performance is good?

149
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:28,825
Jin Mi,

150
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,375
I was summoned

151
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,950
by your grievance last night.

152
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,075
I have been wakeful all night because of you .

153
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:38,450
You have no idea how sly Run Yu is.

154
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,075
Alright.

155
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,200
Even Dan Zhu’s instrument doesn’t work anymore.

156
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,600
I have risked my life to save you.

157
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you going to keep treating me like this?

158
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
Alright. Alright.

159
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,625
You really have no conscience.

160
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,925
Lord Puchi,

161
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:52,775
I will never ever forget

162
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:53,750
the big favor you did me.

163
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you satisfied now?

164
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,375
I’m sad now.

165
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,575
Enough.

166
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,225
I haven't asked you yet.

167
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:01,500
How did you manage to slip in?

168
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,175
He’s smart,

169
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,275
but I’m smarter than him.

170
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,325
Did you steal this under his nose?

171
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,350
It took me so much effort.

172
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,725
Run Yu is still a night owl

173
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,525
even though he has become Heavenly Emperor.

174
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,750
I had no solution

175
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,975
but to wait until he fell asleep.

176
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,075
I almost fell asleep when I was waiting.

177
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,575
When the dawn broke,

178
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,775
he finally fell asleep,

179
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:28,850
which providing a chance for me to take it.

180
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Can you change back and then talk to me?

181
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,400
You are wearing this face talking to me.

182
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,000
It’s very awkward.

183
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,950
Really?

184
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,050
I also think so.

185
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,650
I’m the most handsome
man in all over the six realms.

186
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,025
Enough?

187
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:44,100
I have you remind you.

188
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,350
Kuang Lu is very clever.

189
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,300
No more delay.

190
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:47,725
Let's hurry back to Floral Realm.

191
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,325
Jin Mi, wait a moment.

192
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:50,150
Where are you going?

193
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,125
What are you doing?

194
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,475
Hurry up.

195
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:06,700
No.

196
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,450
What a nuisance!

197
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,700
Let’s go.

198
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,400
Your Majesty,

199
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:39,850
Why are you here?

200
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,325
Has everything at the Empyrean Cloud Palace

201
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,200
been arranged in order?

202
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,150
You,

203
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,000
you have gone back to the Xuanji Palace

204
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,450
to see Water Immortal, haven’t you?

205
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,975
Why are you here now, Your Majesty?

206
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,475
Today’s big His Majesty’s wedding day.

207
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,925
Keep your spirit high, brothers.

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,475
Yes.

209
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:03,950
Yes.

210
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,950
Hello, bros.

211
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,525
Hi. Hi. Hi.

212
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:09,675
Happy wedding day, Your Majesty and Miss Immortal.

213
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:10,700
May you guys share my happiness.

214
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:15,250
Today's my wedding day.

215
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,550
May you guys share my happiness.

216
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,900
Here are the red packets for you.

217
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,575
One for each.

218
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:20,775
One for each. Take it.

219
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,250
There is much power inside.

220
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,800
Keep it safe.

221
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:23,650
Take it. Take it.

222
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,225
Thank you, Your Majesty.

223
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,150
Take it.

224
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,625
Thank you, Your Majesty.

225
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:26,975
Help me give out these red packets.

226
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,050
What trick are you playing?

227
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,125
What?

228
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,275
Today is our wedding day.

229
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,575
I’m happy.

230
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,650
Well,

231
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,950
Today is my wedding day.

232
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,125
Why do you guys look so upset?

233
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,700
I’m happy.

234
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,250
And you have to be happy, too.

235
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:42,575
If I’m in good mood,

236
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,775
I’ll give rewards to you all.

237
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,575
It’s the wedding convention of our Floral Realm.

238
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,075
Just take it.

239
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:54,975
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Miss Immortal.

240
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,575
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Miss Immortal.

241
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,750
The wedding ceremony of me and
Water Immortal is going to be held tonight.

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,400
Please work your shifts carefully.

243
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,750
I definitely won’t treat you badly.

244
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:09,525
Please be assured, Your Majesty.

245
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:11,550
We will do our best

246
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:12,900
to guarantee the peace and safety in Heaven Realm.

247
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:16,675
lord Po Jun,

248
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,600
those bad guys of Demon Realm

249
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,150
can take all means available
in order to get what they want.

250
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,650
Someone may change their shape into mine

251
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,750
and come here

252
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,250
to deceive you guys.

253
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,900
Yes, Your Majesty. I got it.

254
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:30,900
Your Majesty,

255
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,600
are you okay?

256
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,250
You hit me so hard.

257
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,700
It’s a flirting trick.

258
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,925
The fool is coming.

259
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,100
He’s coming.

260
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,175
I borrowed Water Immortal

261
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,350
to explore the essence of spiritual practice.

262
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,125
Yan You!

263
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,550
I’m dead!

264
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:14,650
Where is Water Immortal?

265
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,200
How dare you!

266
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,700
How dare you pretend to be His Majesty.

267
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:18,925
Take him down.

268
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,625
How dare you!

269
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,225
Can’t you even recognize me?

270
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:27,325
His Majesty has the natural treasure, mermen tears.

271
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:28,575
How do you prove that
you are the real Heavenly Emperor?

272
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,500
Can you only recognize the merman tears?

273
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,550
Can’t you recognize my Red Clouds Sword?

274
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,575
I’m guilty, Your Majesty.

275
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,025
A villain pretended to be you

276
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:45,300
and took away Water Immortal.

277
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:48,650
I didn’t notice it. I’m guilty.

278
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,525
How long has it been since they left?

279
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:52,850
About one hour.

280
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,400
Come with me.

281
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,375
I won’t marry him.

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,100
That's the whole story.

284
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,900
What?

285
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,675
It’s really hard to judge a person’s
true nature from his or her appearance.

286
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,825
A bad bamboo can’t produce good bamboo shoots.

287
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,775
The new Heavenly Emperor

288
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,175
is even better at scheming than
the past Heavenly Emperor Tai Wei.

289
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,900
Jin Mi,

290
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
we will definitely try our best to protect you.

291
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,550
But I’m afraid that the news about
your running away won’t be kept for long.

292
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,450
We must make plans early.

293
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,575
Run Yu won't hurt me.

294
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,975
Now the most urgent matter

295
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:31,975
is to find Hairy Feather

296
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:34,475
to cure Xu Feng’s autophagy pain
caused by the Golden Elixir.

297
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,450
Hairy Feather grows near the lake.

298
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,700
Let Mr. Hu take you there.

299
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,100
Bad news!

300
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,300
The Heavenly Emperor and the soldiers

301
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,375
are coming.

302
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:44,775
So early.

303
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,550
We should never let Jin Mi
be at his control again.

304
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,400
Take Jin Mi,

305
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,650
and run away through the back hall.

306
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,850
I will deal with things outside.

307
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,900
OK.

308
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,550
Let’s go.

309
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:54,250
Go.

310
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,500
Go. Go.

311
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,675
Go.

312
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,100
I didn’t know you were coming here, Your Majesty.

313
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:17,400
Sorry for not having welcome you in time.

314
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:20,375
Chief Peony, you have been safe and sound.

315
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:24,400
How come you are here now, Your Majesty?

316
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,450
Today I’m here for two things.

317
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,375
One is

318
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,475
to take Mi back to finish our wedding ceremony.

319
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,550
The other

320
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,550
is to invite the floral chiefs

321
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,075
to go to the Empyrean Heaven and
attend our wedding ceremony as the witnesses.

322
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,475
What?

323
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,300
Jin Mi is not in Heaven Realm?

324
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,575
Mi is tempted by someone.

325
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,575
She came here to get the herb Hairy Feather

326
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,825
for that demon, Xu Feng.

327
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,950
What?

328
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,575
Haven’t you seen her, Chief Peony?

329
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,525
Our young master is missing
because of your poor supervision.

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,725
We haven’t accused you yet.

331
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:04,150
How come you are here
to ask us to give you Jin Mi.

332
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,600
You don’t know the twists and turns
and misunderstandings

333
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,600
in this matter.

334
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:12,475
But I don't want this trivial matter

335
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,675
to affect our relationship.

336
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:15,675
Misunderstanding?

337
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,400
Your Majesty, you led this well-armed soldiers

338
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,225
and came here directly

339
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,075
to disturb the peace of our Floral Realm.

340
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,900
I’m terrified.

341
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't know what is the
misunderstanding in this matter.

342
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,400
It’s a matter of expediency.

343
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,225
Sorry for having been rude.

344
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,875
The wedding today

345
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,275
has been proclaimed in all over the six realms.

346
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,325
Jin Mi

347
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,100
is the Heavenly Empress
recognized by people all over the world.

348
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:42,200
I hope that you will take
the overall interests into account

349
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,025
and look for Jin Mi with us.

350
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,820
This is just the story from your side,

351
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,425
Your Majesty.

352
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,675
Jin Mi is not an ignorant child.

353
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:51,250
If she leaves,

354
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,100
there must be some reason for it.

355
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,550
If you

356
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:55,800
insist on siding with Jin Mi regardless of her mistake,

357
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,925
then don’t blame me for being rude.

358
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:03,425
You!

359
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:06,675
How dare you!

360
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,925
Your Majesty,

361
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,675
this is Floral Realm.

362
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,400
Floral Realm has always been

363
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,225
an indispensable part of Heaven Realm

364
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,700
since the very beginning of this world.

365
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,150
The past Heavenly Emperor was lenient,
and the past Floral Immortal died early

366
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,425
so that the power has been
transferred into others’ hands.

367
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,275
You have intervened in the affairs
beyond your duties for several thousand years.

368
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:26,500
Have you forgot the rule
of superiority and inferiority?

369
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,025
We are just doing what is required
by the past Floral Immortal.

370
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:29,725
We didn’t...

371
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:30,875
Your Majesty,

372
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,025
then what do you want us to do?

373
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:39,075
You should learn how to be a subordinate.

374
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:41,825
You’d better pray that Jin Mi

375
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:43,200
will become the Heavenly Empress smoothly.

376
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:44,450
Only in this way

377
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,075
can you guarantee the peace in Floral Realm.

378
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,125
-Don’t get inside.
-Don’t get inside.

379
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,950
Show up.

380
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,650
You have crossed me in everything.

381
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,500
Don’t you feel guilty in front of
our mother who has passed away?

382
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,175
Run Yu,

383
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,900
I really don't want you

384
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,100
to keep doing wrong anymore.

385
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,625
Where is Jin Mi?

386
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,275
She has left Flower Realm.

387
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,075
She’s gone.

388
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,625
Don’t you believe me?

389
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,250
If she had left,

390
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,000
she wouldn’t have left you here to stop me.

391
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:05,725
Give it to me.

392
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:07,325
What?

393
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:08,975
What did you steal from me?

394
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,475
Whether you can get it or not

395
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,675
depends on your ability, Your Majesty.

396
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,000
Fairy Shangyuan,

397
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:50,725
I heard that Water Immortal
had run away this morning.

398
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:51,825
Is the wedding ceremony
going to be held as scheduled?

399
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,475
As scheduled.

400
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:55,675
Yes.

401
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,500
Jin Mi.

402
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:06,650
Lian Qiao.

403
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,650
How come you are here?

404
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,750
I am looking for Hairy Feather.

405
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,825
I can’t find it anywhere. Why?

406
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:12,700
Hairy Feather?

407
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,450
Is it that?

408
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,600
What?

409
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:18,950
Are you looking for the thing

410
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,625
that looks like a small umbrella

411
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:22,025
and also kind of look like feathers?

412
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:22,900
Yes. Yes. That’s it.

413
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,750
Have you seen it? Where is it?

414
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,225
Jin Mi,

415
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:27,260
a few days ago,

416
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,575
my mother picked all the herbs

417
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,175
to make mutton dumplings for me.

418
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,300
What?

419
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,975
Do you know that it can save people’s life?

420
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,825
If you wants to eat mutton dumplings,

421
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:37,625
you can put spring onions

422
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,575
or carrots in the dumplings.

423
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:40,625
Why did you put Hairy Feather?

424
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:42,775
I don’t like spring onions.

425
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,950
And Mr. Hu wouldn’t let me eat carrots.

426
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,675
It’s a reckless waste.

427
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:47,600
I’m anxious to...

428
00:26:49,425 --> 00:26:51,100
What should we do now, Jin Mi?

429
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:51,850
Don't touch me.

430
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:53,925
Don't blame her.

431
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,325
It’s not late to plant it now.

432
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:56,900
Mr. Hu.

433
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,650
How?

434
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:10,350
Mi. Mi.

435
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,675
Mr. Hu, where is the Hairy Feather?

436
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,000
It hasn’t been planted yet.

437
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,450
You...

438
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,375
Well, you guys protect me.

439
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,325
I’ll plant it now.

440
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,200
OK.

441
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,725
Come.

442
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,175
Honghong,

443
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,025
I heard that the Heavenly Emperor

444
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,600
had cast an escape proof net in Floral Realm

445
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,625
to look for Little one.

446
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,675
Don't panic. Yan You is stopping him.

447
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,100
I couldn’t stop him.

448
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:35,050
You!

449
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:38,850
Mi,

450
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:41,300
it seems that he is determined

451
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,175
to take you back this time.

452
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,050
Can you buy one hour for me?

453
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:45,975
Yes, we can.

454
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:48,125
We’ll try our best to stop him.

455
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:49,050
Honghong,

456
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:50,875
we all count on you this time.

457
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:53,575
I haven’t shown my real power for long time.

458
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,875
Let me have a try.

459
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,575
OK. Try it.

460
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:18,450
It’s Attached Love.

461
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Honghong,

462
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,025
I haven’t seen this amazing magic
of yours for six thousand years.

463
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
The best steel should be
used to make the knife’s edge.

464
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,800
You are still very powerful.

465
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,600
Run Yu can’t break this ward

466
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,050
within three hours with his present power.

467
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,800
Mi, don’t worry. Just focus on planting the herb.

468
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,575
OK.

469
00:28:34,975 --> 00:28:36,125
Lord Puchi,

470
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:38,475
you stay here protecting Jin Mi.

471
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,050
We three are to distract
the attention of those soldiers.

472
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,980
No more delay.

473
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,540
Let’s go.

474
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,325
Go.

475
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,625
Hurry.

476
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:06,625
General, I didn’t find her.

477
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:20,625
Go get him.

478
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:22,675
Stop.

479
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,850
Your Majesty,

480
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,900
Water Immortal is not here.

481
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:30,875
You may go.

482
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:31,725
Yes, Your Majesty.

483
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,150
Set up the battle formations.

484
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,900
It’s just a small trick.

485
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:39,475
Uncle.

486
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,700
Your Majesty,

487
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,925
if you still regard me as your uncle,

488
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:46,300
then listen to me.

489
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:47,650
Let go of her.

490
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:48,850
Uncle,

491
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,250
if you still regard me as the Heavenly Emperor,

492
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:51,700
then don't intervene in this matter.

493
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,300
Mi,

494
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,375
actually, I owe you an apology.

495
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,625
Why?

496
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:19,400
To be honest,

497
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
I am the adopted son of

498
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,350
Run Yu’s biological mother, Lord Dongting.

499
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,100
No wonder,

500
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:37,900
no wonder I always feel that

501
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
there is some connection that is hard to explain

502
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,675
between you and Run Yu.

503
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:44,675
Now I see.

504
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:49,550
I was raised up by my foster mother.

505
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:52,800
The time when I stayed with her

506
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,900
is much longer than the
time when Run Yu stayed with her.

507
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,820
At the beginning,

508
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,100
in order to take revenge on the Heavenly Empress,

509
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,000
she attempted to hurt Xu Feng many times.

510
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,825
In order to repay her,

511
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,525
I had to do many misdeeds against my conscience.

512
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,225
I did make use of you at the beginning.

513
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,450
I induced you to attend the
birthday banquet of Heavenly Empress.

514
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,175
But I really didn't expect that

515
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:21,125
it would get you involved in
such a dangerous situation.

516
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,150
The terrible things that happened later,

517
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:26,700
no mater those are artificial or destined,

518
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,375
are not what I want.

519
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,050
Sorry, Mi.

520
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,475
I guess it’s too late for my apology.

521
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,225
If it were in the past,

522
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
I definitely wouldn’t forgive you.

523
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,825
But after going through all these things,

524
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,025
I gradually find that

525
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,675
things are not simply black or white.

526
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:50,775
And nothing is constant.

527
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,180
I'll never forget

528
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,425
how you protect me and Rou Rou from Qiong Qi.

529
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:01,350
You are always my benefactor.

530
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,675
You are my friend.

531
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,500
You were my friend.

532
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,425
You are my friend.

533
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:11,725
And in the future you will still be my friend.

534
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,350
Mi,

535
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,375
now that we have confessed to each other,

536
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,325
can our relationship be closer now?

537
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I have made matches

538
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,325
for people for several thousand years.

539
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,175
I come to realize

540
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,050
that nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

541
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,275
Why are you so stubborn?

542
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,950
The most unreliable thing in the world

543
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,000
is people’s mind.

544
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,725
It changes.

545
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,600
Why should I give up?

546
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:43,025
People can’t stand being made use of.

547
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,300
Jin Mi doesn’t love you,

548
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,675
not because you can’t compare with Xu Feng,

549
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,860
but because all the
deliberate actions and scheming

550
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,700
can't compare with a pure heart.

551
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,700
Ask yourself.

552
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,250
Throughout your life,

553
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,350
who have you treated with sincerity?

554
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:03,625
Others may not know my situation at that time.

555
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,175
Don’t you even know that, uncle?

556
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,925
If I had treated others with sincerity,

557
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:09,750
I would have been doomed
once I made any mistake.

558
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,825
There are not many people like Tu Yao.

559
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,400
If you don’t treat others with sincerity,

560
00:35:13,575 --> 00:35:14,450
how can you expect

561
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,525
others would treat you with sincerity?

562
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:16,775
Put yourself in my shoes.

563
00:35:17,225 --> 00:35:18,300
Over all these years,

564
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,225
who has really put himself in my shoes?

565
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,525
When I was perplexed and helpless,

566
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,275
who stood out and spoke for me?

567
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:28,075
Now

568
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:30,775
none of you has the right

569
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,000
to tell me what to do

570
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,475
and judge me.

571
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:49,850
Jin Mi,

572
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,000
bad news.

573
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,550
What happened, Lian Qiao?

574
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:55,625
Heavenly Emperor and Moon immortal

575
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,275
are fighting.

576
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,800
It seems Moon Immortal

577
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,900
can’t hold on for long.

578
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,825
Jin Mi.

579
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:09,075
Lord Puchi,

580
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,700
give this to phoenix.

581
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:11,900
It’s planted by you.

582
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,300
You should give it to him yourself.

583
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,125
I can't leave.

584
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:15,850
If I leave,

585
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,050
Floral Realm will be in trouble.

586
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,125
Please.

587
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,200
You!

588
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,475
You are block-headed.

589
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:43,075
Why do you give up all the snakes for a bird

590
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,800
and then throw yourself into a loong’s arms?

591
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:46,175
Let me tell you something.

592
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:49,350
He looks very innocent.

593
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,600
But actually his heart

594
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,875
is darker and more turbid than

595
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,000
the mire in the Taihu Lake.

596
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:56,250
He is wicked, narrow-minded and skeptical.

597
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,200
He always bears grudge against others. He is shrew.

598
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,075
Let me tell you something.

599
00:36:59,075 --> 00:36:59,875
If you go on like this,

600
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:00,925
you will be at his full control sooner or later.

601
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,350
He will make full use of you.

602
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,225
Go on.

603
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,000
Why don’t you go on?

604
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:23,625
I’m wondering how vicious I am.

605
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,700
By the way,

606
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,000
mom’s death day is around the corner.

607
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,350
I’m going to prepare some sacrificial offerings for her.

608
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:30,750
See you.

609
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,550
If you have cooled down
and horsed around long enough,

610
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,475
then go back with me.

611
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:05,750
As long as I we get married tonight,

612
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:08,175
everything will be OK.

613
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:09,925
And I will let bygones be bygones.

614
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:26,625
Where is she?

615
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,650
My mother called me home for dinner.

616
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,150
You!

617
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:50,900
I’m exhausted.

618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,550
Are you older than me?

619
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,950
Why do you dally so much every time?

620
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:57,450
You wasted much time.

621
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,950
Run Yu is hard to deal with.

622
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,025
I had a hard time getting rid of him.

623
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:03,400
Before I got here,

624
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,425
I had to use cover-up magic along the way

625
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,150
and got rid of several troops of soldiers.

626
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:05,975
It’s really a hard time.

627
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,000
You said you had a hard time.

628
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,125
You are empty-handed.

629
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,425
I had a harder time than you.

630
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,575
I carried her here from Floral Realm.

631
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:14,925
I’m so tired. My waist almost gave in.

632
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:17,050
My legs are trembling.

633
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,225
I have never seen a frost flower
that is so heavy before.

634
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,650
What did she eat growing up?

635
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,200
Is she heavy? Let me have a try.

636
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:25,300
Behave yourself.

637
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:27,750
Do you want her to marry that devil man or not?

638
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,075
If you delay any longer,

639
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:29,925
it will be too late.

640
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:30,350
You are right.

641
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,800
-Boatman, we need to cross the river.
-Okay.

642
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,575
Your Majesty,

643
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:04,500
we have searched all over the Floral Realm

644
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,400
but we couldn’t find Water Immortal.

645
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,550
Make it proclaimed all over the six realms that

646
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:35,875
Floral Realm will be blocked from now on.

647
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:38,825
I will destroy one kind of plant every day

648
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:39,925
until Jin Mi comes back.

649
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,750
Don’t put any hope into it.

650
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,475
Chief Peony! Chief Peony!

651
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,325
-Chief Peony!
-Peony!

652
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,175
Even if you are gonna to destroy the entire Floral Realm,

653
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,450
we will not let Jin Mi

654
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,575
be at your control.

655
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:03,900
You attacked me, the Heavenly Emperor.

656
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:05,500
It’s a capital offense.

657
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,575
Let's start from you tomorrow.
