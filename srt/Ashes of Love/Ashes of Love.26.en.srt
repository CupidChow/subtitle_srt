"Episode 26"

3
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,900
Jin Mi,

4
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,140
here is a letter from Auntie.

5
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
Dear Jin Mi,

6
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
I have read your letter and learned everything.

7
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,098
The kings have been caring for us through the ages,

8
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:50,517
and in return, our family has been
working for them for generations.

9
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,480
We vow to live or die with King Yi.

10
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,860
Duke Nanping is a traitor.

11
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,444
He is steeped in crime, wanting to replace King Yi.

12
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:03,940
Evildoers will not live.

13
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,120
You should observe the rules of our family

14
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,440
and assist King Yi in saving the people.

15
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Don’t just care about our survival,

16
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,200
so that King Yi can bring order out of chaos.

17
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,180
When the crooked ministers are eliminated,

18
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,120
our family can smile in the underworld.

19
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,540
Jin Mi, what to do?

20
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,580
What to do?

21
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,580
My Lord, the Saint Girl wishes to meet you.

22
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,100
Let her in.

23
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,620
Yes.

24
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,780
Duke Nanping.

25
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,840
You’ve been working very hard.

26
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,040
His Majesty spat blood and fainted this morning.

27
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,060
You’re a genius.

28
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,940
I come to

29
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,780
ask about the prescription.

30
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,780
You ask me about prescription?

31
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,020
What a surprise.

32
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,700
Go ahead.

33
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,740
Recently,

34
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,940
I dispense medicines as your order,

35
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,980
but

36
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,860
if you want the poison to take effect ten days later,

37
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,300
I have to consider the dosage
of each medicinal herb accurately.

38
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,340
I heard that His Majesty
has the habit of taking medicated diet,

39
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,440
so I need

40
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
a list of his meals

41
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,260
in the past year.

42
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,720
It must specify the amounts of
the main and supplementary ingredients

43
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,600
and the food intake of each meal.

44
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,940
It’s easy.

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,620
The Food Supervisor is responsible for this.

46
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,680
I’ll order him to make such a list

47
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,400
and send it to you.

48
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,520
Thank you.

49
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,175
"With a heavenly mandate, be everlasting and mighty."

50
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,380
Duke Nanping, it’s the mandate of heaven.

51
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,040
Hope you can be triumphant at one stroke.

52
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,260
Then I’ll expect quietly for the good news.

53
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,980
Okay.

54
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,700
He changes his mind constantly.
I can’t work for him.

55
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,735
Saint Girl, please stop.

56
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,153
Princess Sui He wants to talk to you.

57
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,060
Princess Sui He.

58
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,020
You’ve been working very hard.

59
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,120
Have a seat.

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,880
Thank you.

61
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,540
Sibin Stone Needles?

62
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,040
You have good taste.

63
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,260
They were made by
the King of Medicine, Immortal Sun

64
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,480
before his death.

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,700
They were lost for nearly 100 years

66
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,980
and didn’t appear in the city until some time ago.

67
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,860
Princess Sui He bought it
at an auction for a high price.

68
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,240
Hope you like them.

69
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,700
Thank you so much.

70
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,080
As the saying goes, no gains without pains.

71
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,600
They’re very precious.

72
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,340
You can use them or hand them down in your family.

73
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,280
A hero deserves a treasured sword,
and a famous doctor needs jade needles.

74
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,820
You have been loyal to my father.

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,740
Just accept them.

76
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,260
Oddly enough,

77
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,580
today she is different from

78
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
the girl I met last time.

79
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,940
These girls serve her

80
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,860
or keep watch on her?

81
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,160
How about having a walk with me?

82
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,800
Okay.

83
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,700
What do you want?

84
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,360
Don’t pretend.

85
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,260
I didn’t know until today that

86
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
my father planted you

87
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,020
by the side of His Majesty.

88
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,380
We’re

89
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,220
on the same side.

90
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,860
You and my father are birds of a feather.

91
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,700
You want to kill His Majesty.

92
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,580
Don’t get me involved.

93
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,540
We’re different.

94
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,220
It’s not that easy.

95
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,460
Your family observes strict rules.

96
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,520
Once His Majesty dies,

97
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,740
you’ll die as well.

98
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Even if you succeed in escaping,

99
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,660
I won’t let you go.

100
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,760
Duke Nanping may

101
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
ask her to sound me out.

102
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,180
I have to be careful.

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
You’re right.

104
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,520
But I’m just a nobody.

105
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,720
I’m too humble

106
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,860
to compare myself with His Majesty.

107
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,380
What’ll you do

108
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,480
if you have to be responsible for

109
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,140
the survival of your family?

110
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,500
I just know that

111
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,140
if His Majesty is alive,

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,980
my father can live an easy life in old age.

113
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,440
If my father succeeds,

114
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,880
His Majesty will die definitely.

115
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,480
She is different from her father.

116
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,660
She likes His Majesty.

117
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,400
At such harsh times,

118
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,080
forget it, I can’t tell her my real intentions.

119
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,340
Aren’t you afraid that

120
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,160
your father heard what you said?

121
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
So what?

122
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,740
He’ll just lock me up

123
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,160
as he does these days

124
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,260
to make me blind, deaf and dumb

125
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,560
and prevent me from

126
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,800
hearing of His Majesty.

127
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,280
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

128
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,820
I’m his daughter.

129
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,260
What else can he do to me?

130
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,720
I can do nothing to him either.

131
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,580
If he succeeds one day,

132
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
I can do nothing to him.

133
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,100
But I’ll torture

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,020
you traitors

135
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,960
to avenge His Majesty.

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,780
I show great admiration  for you.

137
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,380
You just said

138
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,880
you would avenge His Majesty,

139
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,160
but you don’t dare to turn to your father.

140
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,160
Instead, you transfer your anger on us.

141
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,500
As the saying goes,

142
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,300
well,

143
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,580
he who only stole a hook is to be beheaded,

144
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,580
while he who manipulated his country
is to become a seigneur.

145
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,940
Princess Sui He, I have to leave.

146
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,960
It’s Princess Sui He.

147
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,280
Go. Go.

148
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,400
Help.

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,060
Snake.

150
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,300
Help.

151
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,100
Princess Sui He.

152
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,720
Don’t move.

153
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,680
It’s of severe toxicity,

154
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,060
but don’t worry.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,960
It’s Liuyeqing.
It won’t bite you.

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
Don’t move.

157
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,940
Hurry up. Take it away.

158
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,980
Hurry up.

159
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,260
What did you spread?

160
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,060
Realgar powder.

161
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,720
It can expel snakes and insects.

162
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,300
Your Highness

163
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,900
What did you do to Princess Sui He?

164
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,240
Your Highness

165
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,420
Snake.

166
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,580
Leave.

167
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,060
Your Highness

168
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,140
Are you alright?
Are you hurt?

169
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,300
Burn this bamboo forest.

170
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,620
I don’t want to see that disgusting thing any more.

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,840
I’ll order to do that.

172
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,720
Well,

173
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,480
I almost forgot the medicinal liquor of Immortal Run Yu.

174
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait, Princess Sui He.

175
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,300
I just saw that the snake is complete and strong.

176
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,120
Could you give it to me?

177
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,620
That is a good material for making wine.

178
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Besides, you order to burn

179
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,400
all the green bamboos in order to kill a snake.

180
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,620
What a pity.

181
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,560
They’re valueless bamboos.

182
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,220
They’re not worth mentioning at all compared with Princess Sui He’s health.

183
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,200
Forget it.
Catch it quickly.

184
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,000
I don’t want to see it again.

185
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Thank you.

186
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,660
It’s realgar.

187
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,220
It runs that way.

188
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,080
Fortune-teller,

189
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,080
why do you sleep here?

190
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,340
I recall the sages

191
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
and feel the wind of the bamboo forest here.

192
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
Beauty, what are you doing here?

193
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,060
I come to catch a snake.

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,460
Snake? Where is it?

195
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,760
Maybe it’s not here.

196
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,880
You scared me.

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,040
Fortune-teller, you walk haltingly

198
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,280
and your feet are puffy.

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
You may be poisoned.

200
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,480
Were you bitten by the snake?

201
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,520
Moreover, why do you
have a strong smell of realgar?

202
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,140
Did that snake

203
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,760
run over you?

204
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,520
Was I bitten by the snake?

205
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,820
Hurry up.
Feel my pulse.

206
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,000
I feel dizzy.
Am I poisoned?

207
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,580
I have felt it.

208
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,060
You have a strong pulse and sufficient blood and qi.

209
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,300
It’s like

210
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,240
that of a woman who has been pregnant for four months.

211
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,920
You’re fine.

212
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,140
Beauty, we should take pleasure
in the welfare of living things.

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,100
Why do you

214
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,980
want to catch the snake?

215
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,080
I’ll use it to make wine.

216
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,580
Don’t you know?

217
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,780
It can dissipate cold, dispel dampness

218
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,260
and promote blood circulation to arrest pain.

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,760
Pitifully, it has run away, or…

220
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,400
Well,

221
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,360
it’s the most beautiful snake

222
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,820
I have ever met since childhood.

223
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,000
Really?

224
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,900
Beauty, you have excellent medical skills

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,540
and good taste.

226
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,800
You can’t do that.

227
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,800
You have to leave a way out

228
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,520
for the common women in the world.

229
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,660
I’m flattered.

230
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,220
In fact, my medical skills...

231
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,460
Her memory has been erased?

232
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,660
She was so sacred

233
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,960
when seeing my real body just now.

234
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
And she is confused

235
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,180
at the sight of me now.

236
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,340
I’ll try.

237
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,700
Princess Sui He, hope that you are well.

238
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,160
She doesn’t recognize me?

239
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,340
How dare you.

240
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
You can’t address Princess disrespectfully by name.

241
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,040
Why do you trespass on our backyard?

242
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,580
Calm down.

243
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,320
In fact, he is a fortune-teller.

244
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,020
He knows the previous life and the future life.

245
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,080
He is half an immortal.

246
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,400
I’m Puchi Jun,

247
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,000
a new hanger-on.

248
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,700
Sorry to

249
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,540
offend you just now.

250
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,500
What a strange name.

251
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,140
She really becomes an ordinary person?

252
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,060
Sorry, I dominate the mortal world.

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,940
You’re noble and beautiful.

254
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,980
You must be famous and
go through ups and downs in this life.

255
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,340
Don’t be glib-tongued.

256
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,380
Why does my father recruit

257
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,800
people from all walks of life?

258
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,806
"Hongchang Restaurant"

259
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,380
Puchi Jun.

260
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,900
What a funny name.

261
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,720
It’s not a name given by your parents, right?

262
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,400
Yes. To be honest,

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,500
it was given

264
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,220
by my wife.

265
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,500
What do you think? Is it pleasant to hear?

266
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,980
It’s funny but suitable.

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,580
You must love

268
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,920
your wife dearly.

269
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,120
Yes.

270
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,200
Why do you

271
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,880
work for Duke Nanping?

272
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
I idle away my time.

273
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,080
Duke Nanping has over 3,000 hangers-on.

274
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
He doesn’t personally

275
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
recruit all of them.

276
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,720
After we said goodbye to each other last time,

277
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,780
I lived a miserable life.

278
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,280
His men asked me

279
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,960
to tell their fortunes.

280
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,960
Alas.

281
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,760
Since you’re a fortune-teller,

282
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,000
tell my fortune.

283
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,820
Nine out of ten divination practice are wrong.
It’s a trick.

284
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,780
What do you want to know?

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,460
I, I want…

286
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,460
Beauty,

287
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
your frown

288
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,920
almost pokes your veil.

289
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,180
What worries you?

290
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,780
What’ll you do

291
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,220
if someone threats you with your weakness

292
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,000
and forces you

293
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,600
to do something against your will with a knife?

294
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,280
I’m the ruler of my destiny.
Ignore him.

295
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,340
He threats me with my weakness.

296
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,740
If I obey, I’ll make a mistake.
If I disobey, I’ll suffer.

297
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,480
We are in the same boat.

298
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,500
We are in the same boat?

299
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,600
Puchi Jun, you know fates well

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,620
and foretell things accurately.
What worries you?

301
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,760
Come on.
Forget all these.

302
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,080
Drink until drunk when you can

303
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,780
and lift the problems until you can’t lift it.

304
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,760
Come on. Cheers.

305
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,140
Cheers.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,932
"Peace reigns over the land"

307
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,520
Your Majesty, you’re seriously ill.
As the chancellor,

308
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
I can’t share your worries.

309
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,240
I let you and the people down.

310
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,220
I feel guilty.

311
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,900
Don’t say that.
Stand up.

312
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,713
I’m not a qualified king, so I get sick.

313
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,060
It has nothing to do with you.

314
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,400
Do you have something important?
Why do you come personally?

315
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,380
Your Majesty, I want to submit a memorial.

316
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,980
Get married?

317
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,460
Why do you always ask me to get married

318
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,520
but not pay attention

319
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,500
to the state affairs?

320
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,380
Please pardon me for my boldness.

321
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,160
Now you’re in poor health, but still have no child.

322
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,040
I worry it’ll endanger our state,

323
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,960
so it’s time to get married.

324
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,440
It can remove the evils,

325
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,900
and you will have sons

326
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,460
to govern our state.

327
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,560
You’re right,

328
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,900
but now I’m in poor health.

329
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,940
I worry I’ll waste those girls’ youth,

330
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,740
so I’ll think about it after recovery.

331
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,540
It’s very glorious and meritorious

332
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,540
to be your consorts and
give birth to children for you.

333
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,060
Nobody will refuse such a good thing.

334
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,420
You mean,

335
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,460
I won’t recover?

336
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,300
I don’t mean that.

337
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,880
If you refuse to get married,

338
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,040
please read another memorial.

339
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,900
You’re really considerate.

340
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,620
I’m flattered.
All the ministers jointly submit the memorial

341
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,720
to beg you to select someone
with good quality and super talent

342
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,780
from the royal family as the crown prince

343
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,380
to consolidate the state.

344
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,780
It’s your real intention.

345
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,960
You say so much,

346
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,160
but your real intention is to
ask me to select the crown prince.

347
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,320
It’s not my idea,

348
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,460
but all the ministers

349
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,020
actively ask me to do it.

350
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,580
Stop talking about it.
I’ll think about it.

351
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,500
I hope you can recover early.

352
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,940
I’m leaving.

353
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,350
"Beiyuan Villa"

354
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,580
Your trick

355
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,480
really makes trouble for me,

356
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,520
but it’s also a good thing.

357
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,920
Their anxiety will make Duke Nanping slack.

358
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,780
As “The Art of War” describes,

359
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,991
When we are able to attack, we must seem unable;

360
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,494
when using our forces, we must appear inactive;

361
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,704
when we are near, we must
make the enemy believe we are far away;

362
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,831
when far away, we must
make him believe we are near.

363
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,820
It’s a truth.

364
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
I don’t understand.

365
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,160
Duke Nanping

366
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,260
sent you

367
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,460
to kill me,

368
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,182
but he didn’t expect

369
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:45,320
you’d be my helper and save me.

370
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,820
You help me a lot.

371
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,300
Am I right?

372
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,860
Chancellor Fu and other ministers worry I’ll die

373
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,240
and result in the turbulence,

374
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,680
so they want me to
get married to remove the evils.

375
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,460
By then I’ll try my best

376
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,120
to offer you

377
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,020
prescriptions of enriching yin and nourishing kidney

378
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,400
to have many babies.

379
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
You’re so foolish.

380
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,820
In fact,

381
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,180
I don’t like those women.

382
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,000
I mean, I don’t like those women outside the palace.

383
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,940
You had always lived in Saint Doctors’ Family
since your childhood.

384
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,300
Do you want to change your life?

385
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
For example,

386
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,100
for example, be an ordinary girl,

387
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,740
or,

388
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,900
or, be my wife.

389
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,920
I daren’t.

390
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
I grew up in the mountains.

391
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,900
What’s more, I’m boring and know nothing

392
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,680
except treating illnesses and make pills.

393
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,300
I don’t know how to serve as your wife.

394
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,140
In your heart, am I shallow

395
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,600
and not worth marrying?

396
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,440
I

397
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,740
don’t need to marry anyone.

398
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,060
I can live alone.

399
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,980
Your Majesty, your robe.

400
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,240
Jin Mi,

401
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,940
His Majesty falls in love with you?

402
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,220
No.

403
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,400
You fall in love with him?

404
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,360
No.

405
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,360
I won’t fall in love with him.

406
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,000
Jin Mi, keep the rules of our family in mind.

407
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,800
Auntie Jing Jie and presbyters
won’t allow you to do that.

408
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,940
I see.

409
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,660
I won’t fall in love with him.
Don’t worry.

410
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,620
Jin Mi.

411
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,420
Immortal Run Yu,

412
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,860
you, you startle me.

413
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,420
But I’m summoned by you.

414
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,120
Oh, yes.

415
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Immortal Run Yu, Look.

416
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,320
What’s this?

417
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,320
This is the wine I present to you.

418
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,680
I have brewed the wine you want

419
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,920
for you.

420
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,440
Jin Mi, thank you.

421
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,940
Does your epiphyllum bloom?

422
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,180
Yes.

423
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,220
So beautiful.

424
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,620
This yard looks like a fairyland now.

425
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,840
So fragrant.

426
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,900
Immortal Run Yu,

427
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,940
what’s the Heavenly Palace like?

428
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,660
It’s cold and cheerless.
Only some epiphyllum,

429
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,340
an innocent deer

430
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,020
and a young immortal maid accompany me.

431
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,080
He looks sad.

432
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,540
Am I wrong?

433
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,880
It’s so hard to know immortals’ thoughts.

434
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,080
Stop talking about it.

435
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,500
Immortal Run Yu, is there some unique scenery

436
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,240
in the Heavenly Palace?

437
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,980
Can you tell me to widen my horizon?

438
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,700
OK.

439
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,520
There is a rainbow bridge outside my palace,

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,900
and I can see the boundless Milky Way

441
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,660
full of bright stars on it.

442
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,620
It’s very beautiful.

443
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,700
Whenever I miss someone,

444
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,960
I’ll go there.

445
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,520
No wonder,

446
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,020
no wonder whenever I meet you

447
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,460
in my dream,

448
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,360
I always see the rainbow bridge.

449
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,600
You seem to miss that fairy

450
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,040
very much.

451
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,220
Well, Immortal Run Yu,

452
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,420
you told me

453
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,440
that fairy promised to admire the beauty
of epiphyllum with you at night.

454
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,660
Did she do that?

455
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,720
She failed to do it.

456
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,820
It’s really a pity.

457
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,720
No,

458
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,740
because I can do it

459
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,380
with you tonight.

460
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,160
Your Majesty.

461
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,700
Your Majesty.

462
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,940
Who’s he?

463
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,780
He, he’s my friend.

464
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,300
Maybe you don’t believe me.

465
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,100
In fact, he’s an immortal

466
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,260
in the Heavenly Palace.

467
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,160
An immortal?

468
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,080
Xu Feng,

469
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,720
you look so majestic after
being the king in the mortal world.

470
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,331
You’re so bold.

471
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:39,000
You can’t address His Majesty disrespectfully by name.

472
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,780
Wait a minute.

473
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,380
I can guarantee he’s really my friend.

474
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,360
He’s really an immortal.
Believe me.

475
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,880
He’ll catch up with us.

476
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,780
Hurry up. Kill Fire Immortal
and then ask King of Gu City for reward.

477
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,500
Tell me whether you’re Mu Ci or not.

478
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,480
Who do you want to kill with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

479
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,400
He’s not injured. I just freeze him,

480
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,960
and he can move after one hour.

481
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Jin Mi, let’s go out to get some air

482
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,080
to get rid of such a embarrassing night.

483
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,466
I disagree.

484
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,160
No, you can’t defeat him as he is an immortal.

485
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,140
Immortal Run Yu,

486
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,820
please forgive us.

487
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,100
Are you busy?

488
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,560
If so, you can leave first.

489
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,820
I seldom meet such an opponent like him.

490
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,260
I’m loath to leave.

491
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,260
OK, I can also take this opportunity
to limber up my muscles and joints.

492
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,840
Well,

493
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,031
I won’t conjure.

494
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,060
Let’s fight hand to hand

495
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,880
and stop at where we should, OK?

496
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,460
OK.

497
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,620
No, you can’t.

498
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,560
You’re so busy.

499
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,200
There is a fight everywhere.

500
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,920
Puchi Jun,

501
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,720
it’s very late. Why are you here?

502
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,160
I ate too much at night,

503
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,620
so I’m here to help digestion.

504
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,020
I’m very thirsty after going for a walk.

505
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,520
Can you give me some water to drink?

506
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,840
Yan You, why are you here?

507
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,040
Yan You?

508
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,660
I remember you told me

509
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,660
Puchi Jun was the name given by your wife.

510
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,820
A name given by his wife?

511
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,200
Immortal Run Yu, you, you know each other?

512
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,720
He is an immortal, and I’m half an immortal,

513
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,960
so I know him.

514
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,860
No wonder you can tell fortune.

515
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,500
What’s your relationship with Jin Mi?

516
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,260
He,

517
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,660
he’s,

518
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,520
also my friend.

519
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,440
You were reserved in the Heavenly Palace,

520
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,620
but now you’re

521
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,960
a jealous man.

522
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,100
What?

523
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,720
What do you mean?

524
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,400
Yan You, shut up.

525
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,820
I, I defeat Fire Immortal.

526
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,140
Your Highness, I revenge you.

527
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,340
Are you happy?

528
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,220
Jin Mi,

529
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,780
I planned to admire the beauty of epiphyllum

530
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,200
with you quietly

531
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,240
and carelessly tonight,

532
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,140
but I fail to

533
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,860
realize such a small wish.

534
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,060
Immortal Run Yu, faith moves mountains.

535
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,800
The fairy you wait

536
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,620
will come back to you sooner or later.

537
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,280
OK, I’ll wait for her in the Heavenly Palace.

538
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,120
But, he…

539
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,640
Don’t worry. He is fine.

540
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,460
Tonight we cause a sensation.

541
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,760
Sorry, Jin Mi.

542
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,180
I must remove

543
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,360
all your memories about tonight.

544
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,820
Lord Yan You, you have so many enemies.

545
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,080
Why do you offend the demons of Demon Realm?

546
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,960
Because we want

547
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,560
the same treasure.

548
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,140
Because of this arrow?

549
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,960
Where do you get it?

550
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,800
It’s also a good thing if you know it.

551
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,240
Maybe only you can stop my foster mother.

552
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,720
Well, don’t you know this is Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

553
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,940
A lot of money is not more precious
than a professional skill.

554
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,860
It’s not easy for me to get it.

555
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,220
You go to admire the beauty of epiphyllum
in the moonlight again?

556
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,220
Can you do something special?

557
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,300
It won’t be always attractive after repeated admiration.

558
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,440
I’m experienced in it.

559
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,880
Your Highness, how about having a fight?

560
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,560
I haven’t forgiven you

561
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,240
for damaging my epiphyllum before.

562
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,300
You shouldn’t blame me,

563
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,800
because your epiphyllum
was damaged by the Fire Immortal

564
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,060
Is the name “Lord Puchi”

565
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,240
really given by your wife?

566
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,380
You really believe Jin Mi will be your wife?

567
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,280
It’s just a joke.

568
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,660
The one who wants your fiancee

569
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,960
is in Beiyuan Villa now.

570
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,220
He goes after your fiancee aboveboard,

571
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,180
and everyone knows it in the six realms.

572
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,660
Should I teach him a lesson for you?

573
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,146
I should be to blame for it.

574
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:19,107
I was so tolerant before,

575
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,480
so you always covet my fiancee.

576
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,400
You finally exercise your rights as her fiance?

577
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,360
If so, you will be my first enemy.

578
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Jin, Jin Mi.

579
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,420
Jin Mi, wake up.

580
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,560
Jin Mi.

581
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,460
Qiang Huo.

582
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,120
You…

583
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,320
Your Majesty.

584
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,960
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, wake up.

585
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,960
Your Majesty.

586
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,460
What’s going on?

587
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,240
The snake venom in the wine
hasn’t been removed?

588
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,860
All of you drank this jar of wine?

589
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
Your Highness, you’re back.

590
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,500
Let’s go.

591
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,620
Your Highness.

592
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,440
"Shengjing Court"

593
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Search the information about
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow for me.

594
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,480
OK, Your Highness.

595
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,660
A mermaid suddenly shed red tears,

596
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,700
let’s be together forever after this meeting.

597
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,500
Lord Beichen.

598
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,940
Is it a pen name

599
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,880
Father no longer uses?

600
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
Is it painted by Father?

601
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,340
Are these Magic fireballs?

602
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,460
Why does she have Magic fireballs?

603
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,640
Who’s she?

604
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,120
Your Highness, I find it.

605
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,500
Your Highness.

606
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,220
Your Highness.

607
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,880
Do we go back to Xuanji Palace?

608
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,654
I want to walk alone.

609
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,530
Go back first.

610
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,440
Mu Ci.

611
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,960
Mu Ci.

612
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:23,215
Mu Ci.

613
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,040
I have told you Mu Ci is dead.

614
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,040
Xu Feng is my adopted brother,
and Jin Mi is my good friend,

615
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,520
so you can’t hurt them.

616
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,480
If you hurt them

617
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,900
with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow again,

618
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,040
I won’t forgive you.

619
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,080
Now Spirit-Vanishing Arrow is missing.

620
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,100
I can’t find it, either,

621
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,900
so you don’t need to follow me.

622
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,380
Good.

623
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,300
If so, nobody can find it and will be hurt.

624
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,860
Return the brass strip to me.

625
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,180
No.

626
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,720
You…

627
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,520
Your Highness, stop pretending.

628
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,360
Your Highness.

629
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,240
Your Highness.

630
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,700
Your Highness, are you OK?
