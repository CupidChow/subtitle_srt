1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 41"

3
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,400
Now Heavenly Empress is in jail,

4
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,560
while the effect of Autopsy
Wild Silkworms is getting stronger.

5
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,220
What should I do?

6
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Am I doomed to die?

7
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,060
Thank you for saving me.

8
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,220
Follow me.

9
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

10
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,040
is made with bones and blood

11
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,060
of the Spirit-Vanishing Family.

12
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
It has taken almost all my bones and blood

13
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
to make it all these years.

14
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,440
Although I’m barely supported
by the magic power of Heavenly Empress,

15
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
I’m already useless.

16
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,280
I’m afraid I can’t assist you

17
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,320
in doing a great cause.

18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,220
Please allow me to live in seclusion

19
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,080
for the rest of my life.

20
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,420
Auntie and the Bird Family

21
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,800
just lose influence for the time being,

22
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,440
are you going to leave us

23
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,700
like other snobbish immortals?

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,320
I dare not do this.

25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
If Her Majesty didn’t save me back then,

26
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
I wouldn’t be here now.

27
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,620
I’m really grateful

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,000
for her help.

29
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,820
I’ll repay her favor next life.

30
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you going to find your old flame

31
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,380
Princess of Bian City?

32
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,280
Liu Ying and I...

33
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,840
No.

34
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,740
Princess of Bian City and I

35
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,380
have been strangers long before

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,120
and our love is gone.

37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
Make

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow for me

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,460
and I’ll eliminate Autopsy Wild Silkworms for you.

40
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
Thus you’ll be free

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,940
to find your Princess of Bian City

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
to continue your former love.

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,380
OK?

44
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,900
You don’t believe me?

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,740
I’ve transferred all my cultivation this life to you.

46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,840
With the help of Glazed Pure Fire,

47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,380
you must rejuvenate the Bird Family

48
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,080
and help Xu Feng to be the Heavenly Emperor.

49
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,380
I see.

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Take good care of both Xu Feng and the Bird Family.

51
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,800
Don’t let me down.

52
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,260
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.

53
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,460
I’ll fail

54
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
no matter how hard I try.

55
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,180
Do you give up now?

56
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
Even if I try,

57
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,520
nothing will change in the end.

58
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,220
I fail.

59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,260
It’s my honor to play chess

60
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,780
with a master like you.

61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
What?

62
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,440
Nothing is left in the barn of the Bird Family?

63
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,400
Since the Floral Realm stopped
the supply for us last time,

64
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,080
we have been on bad terms with each other.

65
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,940
Although they still

66
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,860
supply flowers, grass and grain,

67
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,400
the amount is much smaller.

68
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,700
We can’t accumulate food all the time.

69
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,960
You should have reported it earlier.

70
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,420
Elder Yin Que asks for a visit.

71
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,280
Let him come in.

72
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

73
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,740
You can leave.

74
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,880
Yes.

75
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,980
Here is my respect, Leader.

76
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,760
Have you heard of

77
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,680
the grain shortage of the Bird Family recently?

78
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,760
What do you mean?

79
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,980
As the leader of the Bird Family,

80
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,360
certainly I know it.

81
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,900
That’s fine.

82
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,500
I worry that you forget us

83
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,580
as you linger in the Heaven Realm.

84
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,180
Since you have known it,

85
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,280
why don’t you take action earlier?

86
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Birds of the family are dying.

87
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
I’ll deal with it.

88
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,940
The deposed Heavenly Empress
appointed you as the leader

89
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,240
and helped you manage the
affairs of the Bird Family back then,

90
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,320
so we’re prosperous.

91
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,060
However, as she loses her influence now,

92
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
elders worry

93
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,180
whether you can assume the task

94
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,840
to protect us safe and sound.

95
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,920
I’ll solve the grain problem properly in three days.

96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,620
I’ll prove

97
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,780
I deserve

98
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,460
the post of the leader.

99
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,920
Then

100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,580
I’ll wait and see.

101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,520
Wait.

102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,700
Don’t you have other matters

103
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,040
to report?

104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,880
What do you mean?

105
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,360
Surely, it’s about your meeting with Demon Lord

106
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,640
in Demon Realm.

107
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,480
Is it necessary to report a meeting of old friends?

108
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,000
If you have spare time,

109
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,940
you’d better solve the grain problem earlier.

110
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,920
Xu Feng is in charge of the Mansion
of the Five-Direction Heaven Troops

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
and controls the gates of the Heaven Realm,

112
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,480
which is heavy responsibility.

113
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,900
However, Xu Feng is ill-behaved and perverse.

114
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
I worry much about it.

115
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I’ll temporarily

116
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,100
hand his position over to you.

117
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,300
Reported by Sui He of the Bird Family.

118
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,140
The Bird Family has been living on flowers and grain.

119
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
Though the Floral Realm has resumed supply,

120
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,300
there are fewer things left in our barns

121
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,980
due to years of food shortage.

122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,340
Now the Bird Family is in danger,

123
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,420
so please offer us grain to relieve us

124
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,260
from the pressing situation.

125
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,560
We are begging for your approval.

126
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,120
Leader.

127
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,180
Is there news from the Heaven Realm?

128
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
No.

129
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,620
No.

130
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,460
I have to go to the Heaven Realm personally

131
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,760
to borrow grain with Heavenly Realm.

132
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,040
But Elder Yin Que and other elders

133
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,520
are waiting for you to have a meeting in the hall.

134
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,500
It’s inappropriate for you to leave now.

135
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,980
They can’t wait to see me

136
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,940
making a fool of myself.

137
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,960
That’s impossible.

138
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,980
Yin Que,

139
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,500
I’ll get even with you

140
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,980
for your meeting Demon Lord.

141
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,020
If she still can’t borrow grain from Heaven Realm...

142
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,220
The Leader is coming.

143
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,880
...we’ll be in deadly danger.

144
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,780
Yes.

145
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,180
It has been three days.

146
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,580
Have you got any idea

147
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,540
to solve the grain problem?

148
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,260
I’ve reported to the Heaven Realm,

149
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,580
but they slow to lend us grain.

150
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,580
I think you’re to blame, Elder Yin Que.

151
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,380
The Bird Family is hit by grain shortage

152
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,960
and the Heaven Realm refuses to lend food.

153
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,860
Does this have anything to do with Elder Yin Que?

154
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,240
He met with Demon Lord

155
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,220
in the Demon Realm several days ago.

156
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,460
His Majesty heard of that

157
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,420
and was very unsatisfied.

158
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,340
He thought we may rebel.

159
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,240
If I didn’t told him

160
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,100
we’re loyal to the Heaven Realm,

161
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,400
he would have sent troops to suppress us.

162
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,380
Well.

163
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,280
I don’t know my meeting with
Demon Lord in Demon Realm

164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,600
even results in such a case.

165
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,880
If His Majesty really doesn’t
want to lend food because of this,

166
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,540
I would like to clarify it

167
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,680
to him with you,

168
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,860
so as to dispel his doubts

169
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,380
and make him lend us food earlier

170
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,960
to relieve us from the pressing situation.

171
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
That really makes sense.

172
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,640
Please go to the Heaven Realm

173
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,420
with Elder Yin Que

174
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,760
to handle the matter now.

175
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,280
Do you have any evidence to prove that

176
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,240
you haven’t colluded with the Demon Realm?

177
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,260
As they didn’t send troops,

178
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,020
it shows

179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,780
they have no evidence of
my collusion with the Demon Realm.

180
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
You fail to borrow grain.

181
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,820
Are you going to blame it on me now?

182
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,880
In the last thousands of years,

183
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,740
I have been devoting myself to the Bird Family

184
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,580
to make it increasingly prosperous.

185
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,300
I try my best to save

186
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,960
the suffering Bird Family now.

187
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,880
Elder Yin Que’s improper behavior

188
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,880
led to grudges between the Heaven Realm and us.

189
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,080
I want to know

190
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,020
whether we can borrow grain from

191
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Demon Realm.

192
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,020
Leader,

193
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,020
Elder Yin Que,

194
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,320
it’s useless to quarrel here.

195
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
It urgent that you should go to

196
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
the Heaven Realm

197
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,300
to tell Heavenly Emperor our loyalty,

198
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
so as to borrow grain earlier.

199
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
Night Immortal is coming.

200
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,640
Here is my respect, Your Highness.

201
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,200
Your Highness.

202
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,400
I don’t think you just

203
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,840
come to play chess with me today.

204
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,400
I heard you met Demon Lord secretly recently.

205
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,620
I wonder what you talked.

206
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,500
You come for it.

207
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,100
I just talked about the past with him.

208
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,860
We discussed nothing.

209
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,860
No one knows what you talked about.

210
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,120
However, it has been reported to the Heaven Realm.

211
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,440
It’s inevitable that if there are

212
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,380
some fictitious guesses.

213
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,140
If His Majesty misunderstands you,

214
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
it’ll be bad for the Bird Family.

215
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,140
His Majesty asked me to investigate it thoroughly.

216
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,120
How do you think

217
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,360
what should I answer?

218
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,860
I’m sorry.

219
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,680
I don’t know what you mean.

220
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
I know

221
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,760
Heaven Realm has overly controlled the Bird Family.

222
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,640
After the Arowana Family was eliminated back then,

223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,220
the deposed Heavenly Empress
let the Bird Family take over

224
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,360
the rich Lake Taihu.

225
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,040
The Bird Family has been much
more thriving and prosperous

226
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,220
than before in the last several thousand years.

227
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,000
You should be satisfied.

228
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,040
Just speak out what is

229
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,780
in your mind.

230
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,920
I don’t like to beat around the bush.

231
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,640
In this case,

232
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,300
I’ll speak it out.

233
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,960
In fact, I come

234
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,020
to ask for your favor.

235
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,820
As a powerless elder of the Bird Family,

236
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,180
I don’t think I can help you.

237
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,060
If the Bird Family knows

238
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,600
its top-secret force deployment defense plan

239
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,280
was revealed by you,

240
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,640
will they allow you

241
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,560
to stay in the Bird Family later?

242
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,000
With His Majesty’s order, today I escorted grain here

243
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,700
to help the Bird Family

244
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,880
as a special envoy of the Heaven Realm.

245
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

246
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,900
The whole Bird Family thanks you very much.

247
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,040
I come here to solve

248
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,400
another matter today.

249
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,680
What is it?

250
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,180
I would like to help you.

251
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,340
Elder Yin Que secretly met Demon Lord

252
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
in Demon Realm not long ago,

253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,840
which I think you should have known it.

254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,340
He secretly met Demon Lord

255
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
with hidden evil.

256
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,660
If you want to punish him,

257
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,340
I’ll assist you fully.

258
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,460
However, the Bird Family is
always loyal to the Heaven Realm.

259
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,080
Please believe us.

260
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,700
It seems that you can’t wait

261
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,660
to punish him.

262
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,800
Princess Sui He once applied to the Heaven Realm

263
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,380
for the heaven troops to
set things right in Yimiao Continent.

264
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,540
However, His Majesty believed the Bird Family is loyal

265
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,980
and asked me to investigate it.

266
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,900
I come here

267
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,140
to tell you the result of the investigation.

268
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,100
Elder Yin Que went to the Demon Realm

269
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,340
just for personal reasons.

270
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,920
Don’t hurt the relation between

271
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,320
the Bird Family and the Heaven Realm for it.

272
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,120
His Majesty didn’t want to suppress us.

273
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,500
It was you, even asked for troops
to deal with Yin Que.

274
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,840
I made such a proposal

275
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,160
in a moment of desperation.

276
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,140
That’s true.

277
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,760
Luckily, no big mistake has been made.

278
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,640
However, you ignored the grain shortage

279
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,360
of the Bird Family

280
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,240
and dealt with Elder Yin Que instead.

281
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,080
You have got it upside down.

282
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,560
I didn’t ignore the grain shortage of the Bird Family.

283
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,980
I wrote to the Heaven Realm

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
for borrowing grain three days ago.

285
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,820
The Heaven Realm hasn’t received your report.

286
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
That’s impossible.

287
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,160
If Elder Yin Que didn’t report it personally

288
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,580
to the Heaven Realm yesterday,

289
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,520
we may have no idea of it all the time.

290
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,500
Sui He,

291
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,600
you are unqualified for the leader of the Bird Family.

292
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,340
Yes.

293
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,460
You are unqualified for it.

294
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,900
Yes.

295
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,560
You are unqualified for it.

296
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,640
Princess Sui He,

297
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,680
just as what elders said,

298
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,020
you suppressed your enemy

299
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,640
and Elder Yin Que

300
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,480
while ignoring the lives of the Bird Family,

301
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,140
which has let His Majesty down.

302
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,780
His Majesty ordered me

303
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,020
to handle this matter with full authority.

304
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,640
However, I think

305
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
I should discuss it

306
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,900
with all elders of the Bird Family.

307
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,660
Your Highness, as you’re
deeply believed by His Majesty now,

308
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,120
we have no doubts.

309
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,300
What’s your opinion, Your Highness?

310
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,860
I think

311
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,880
now that Princess Sui He

312
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,380
doesn’t want to manage the Bird Family,

313
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,740
ask a virtuous and talented person to help her

314
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,160
deal with affairs of the family.

315
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,140
It’s just a suggestion.

316
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,220
The final decision

317
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,480
should be made by you.

318
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,820
Elder Yin Que did a great thing

319
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,880
by borrowing grain from
Heaven Realm for the Bird Family.

320
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,680
Moreover, he has always cherished the Bird Family.

321
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,840
I’m sure he’ll work to bring benefit to the Bird Family.

322
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,920
I recommend him

323
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,220
to deal with the family’s affair for the time being.

324
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,340
We also recommend him to deal with

325
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,500
the family’s affair.

326
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,260
Please take care, Your Highness.

327
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,140
Elder Yin Que,

328
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,800
the Bird Family will be managed by you afterwards.

329
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,640
I admit that I fail.

330
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,440
Since I’ve known your trick,

331
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,340
I won’t change my mind.

332
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,920
That’s fine.

333
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,520
Barns of the Bird Family will be empty for two days.

334
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,580
Sui He will ask the Heaven Realm for help,

335
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
while her report

336
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,720
will disappear.

337
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,200
I hope you can borrow grain personally by then.

338
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,220
With this chance,

339
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,420
I’ll help you to gain the real power of the Bird Family.

340
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,720
It seems that I can’t refuse.

341
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,260
As long as you support me with the Bird Family,

342
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,980
you’ll be leader

343
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,240
of the Bird Family some day,

344
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,480
so you can do anything

345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,340
you want to.

346
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,560
Leader?

347
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,940
What your status will be in the future?

348
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,040
Your Highness Night Immortal is really brilliant.

349
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,440
I’ll fail

350
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,840
no matter how hard I try.

351
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,160
Yin Que,

352
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,020
you colluded with Run Yu

353
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,800
instead of Demon Lord.

354
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,380
Everything I’ve done is

355
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,660
for the future of the Bird Family

356
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,940
rather than the selfish desire like you.

357
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,300
Don’t worry.

358
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,100
I’ll help you deal with

359
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,900
the affairs of the Bird Family with full authority.

360
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,640
Go. Go. Go.

361
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,300
Finally, we’re here in time.

362
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:30,780
Yes.

363
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,440
Look.

364
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,420
Listen, it needs 7 years of magic power.

365
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
Mu Ci,

366
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,820
wherever you’re,

367
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,440
I’ll find you.

368
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,000
Run now.

369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,720
Is Mu Ci making Spirit-Vanishing Arrow again?

370
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,540
Does he still want to hurt Jin Mi?

371
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,800
Your Highness.

372
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,220
Go to Heaven Realm

373
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,380
to kill Run Yu now.

374
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,960
Night Immortal is the son of Heavenly Emperor.

375
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,440
So what?

376
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
He has destroyed what I’ve worked hard for

377
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,740
in thousands of years,

378
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,000
I’ll kill him.

379
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,660
He has strong magic power.

380
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,600
However, most of my magic power has
been used to make the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

381
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,540
I can’t defeat him

382
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,120
even if I have Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

383
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,880
I’ll go with you by then.

384
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,480
If foster mother knew you miss her so much,

385
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,960
she would be very pleased.

386
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,500
Why are you here?

387
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,580
I heard that the power of the Bird Family

388
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,080
has been taken over by Elder Yin Que.

389
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,420
I think

390
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,960
it must have something to do with you.

391
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,780
It seems that you begin to take action.

392
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,460
I just want to

393
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,380
fulfill my mom’s wish.

394
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
However, she made many mistakes

395
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,840
for this wish.

396
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,620
What on earth do you want to say?

397
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,660
I just hope that

398
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,340
you don’t follow her footsteps.

399
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,640
I’m afraid you can’t stay true to the mission

400
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
after making too many mistakes.

401
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,100
I can’t make any mistake on this way.

402
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,860
With just one mistake,

403
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,120
I’ll lose the whole game.

404
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,000
I have nothing to lose.

405
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,280
But when choosing this way,

406
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,660
have you thought about Jin Mi?

407
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
She is innocent.

408
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,000
She shouldn’t be used

409
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,020
or hurt by you.

410
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,380
The Xuanji Palace.

411
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
It went the Xuanji Palace?

412
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,580
Yes.

413
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,740
Go to have a look with me.

414
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,220
Fish Fairy.

415
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,200
Fish Fairy.

416
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,940
Fish Fairy, are you here?

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,900
Well, thank you for saving me.

418
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Today, I specially come for you,
but you’re not here.

419
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,320
I’ll just leave it here.

420
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,020
I didn’t expect Run Yu isn’t here,

421
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,920
while you come by yourself.

422
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,140
That’s great.

423
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,940
What a rare chance!

424
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,200
Kill her with Spirit-Vanishing Arrow now.

425
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,340
The stem of noble dendrobium is very nourishing.

426
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
It can help you restore
magic power as soon as possible.

427
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,140
I hope it can cure you wound

428
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,220
to help you.

429
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,120
Let’s be an ordinary couple

430
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
in the mortal world.

431
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,900
I told you if you hurt Jin Mi again,

432
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,100
you’ll be my enemy.

433
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,720
Don’t do things that are against your conscience.

434
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,540
I know you aren’t that kind of person.

435
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,420
Shoot her now.

436
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Your Highness.

437
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,960
Jin Mi.

438
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,280
Jin Mi.

439
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,540
Take care of her.

440
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,200
Yes.

441
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,080
Your Highness.

442
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,100
Your Highness,

443
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,120
you still care about me.

444
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Jin Mi was hurt by fire magic just now.

445
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,700
Why did you do that?

446
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,980
You know the reason.

447
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,120
You love her,

448
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,700
while she sent tonic to Night Immortal.

449
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,300
I was so furious.

450
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,800
Mi.

451
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,040
What happened?

452
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,700
Someone wanted to hurt Fairy Jin Mi.

453
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,320
Luckily, the Second Prince saved her in time.

454
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,440
Where is he?

455
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,660
He ran after that person.

456
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,900
Go to help him now.

457
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,580
I’ll protect her.

458
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,820
OK.

459
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Mi.

460
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,660
Mi.

461
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,900
Mi.

462
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,020
Fish Fairy.

463
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,440
What happened just now?

464
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,320
I specially sent you tonic just now.

465
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,100
When I was going to leave,

466
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
I was somehow hit

467
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,800
to the ground.

468
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,980
Then I remember nothing.

469
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,380
Did you save me, Fish Fairy?

470
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,280
No,

471
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,920
it was Xu Feng.

472
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,120
It happened in the Xuanji Palace,

473
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,160
so did they want to kill me?

474
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,280
But when choosing this way,

475
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,180
have you ever thought about Jin Mi?

476
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
She is innocent.

477
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
She shouldn’t be used

478
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,060
or hurt by you.

479
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,920
It’s my fault.

480
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,720
I promise,

481
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,640
you won’t be hurt again

482
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,640
afterwards.

483
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,500
Thank you, Fish Fairy.

484
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
I’m fine.

485
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,840
Your Highness,

486
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,540
I didn’t mean to hurt her.

487
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
It was Qi Yuan.

488
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,260
He is the one who wanted to
kill her in the mortal world.

489
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
I know.

490
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,120
He is a friend of Princess of Bian City.

491
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,700
I’ve promised Liu Ying

492
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,880
I won’t kill him.

493
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,380
But he is perverse.

494
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,960
He must want to kill her today.

495
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,120
We can’t spare him.

496
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,720
Liu Ying said

497
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,320
he is kind.

498
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,640
I believe her.

499
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,960
Thank you, Xu Feng.

500
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,720
Mu Ci.

501
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,180
Where is Jin Mi?

502
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,600
Is she all right?

503
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
She is fine.

504
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,640
But he didn’t come to kill her.

505
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Xu Feng,

506
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,900
Autopsy Wild Silkworms planted in him

507
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,300
require regular feeding.

508
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,460
Someone uses Mu Ci with it.

509
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,120
He has been forced to do all things before.

510
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,540
He has no choice.

511
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,380
Autopsy Wild Silkworms?

512
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,260
Did my mother do it?

513
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Auntie saved him.

514
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,500
He chose to do work for auntie.

515
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
Auntie is still in jail,

516
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,760
while you want to disassociate from her.

517
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,720
How ungratefulness!

518
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,220
Sui He.

519
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,920
Now that my mother has been punished

520
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,620
and in jail,

521
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,220
I hope you can forgive her.

522
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,720
As you forgive Mu Ci,

523
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,180
I’ll ask for nothing else

524
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,220
but to take him back

525
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,100
and stay with him forever.

526
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,060
I’ll make atonement

527
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,840
for him.

528
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,580
From now on, no matter what the reason is,

529
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
if you hurt Jin Mi again,

530
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,880
I won’t let you go.

531
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,640
I’ll keep my promise in the mortal world that

532
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,720
I’ll save you when you’re in danger,

533
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,180
but don’t ever try to

534
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,000
touch my bottom line.

535
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,060
I want to meet Jin Mi.

536
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,920
She is sleeping.

537
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,100
She is all right.

538
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,000
I heard you saved her today.

539
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,600
Thank you.

540
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,100
Did you catch the murderer?

541
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,400
Sui He lost her temper and hurt Jin Mi.

542
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,840
Sui He?

543
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,100
This is not trivial.

544
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
Report to Father earlier.

545
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,760
No need.

546
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,800
Sui He...

547
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
It’s because of me.

548
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
I’ll deal with her.

549
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,860
Let me see her.

550
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,500
Xu Feng,

551
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,440
because of you,

552
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,500
Heavenly Empress and Sui He
hurt Jin Mi in succession.

553
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,720
Do you want to

554
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,840
kill her?

555
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,040
I have sent Kuang Lu to ask
Water Immortal to pick her up.

556
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,660
Please go back.

557
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,980
Xu Feng,

558
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,940
I have paid so much for you

559
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,940
and even my power was taken away now.

560
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,740
I’ve lost everything,

561
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,580
while you still just love Jin Mi.

562
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,000
Why?

563
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,660
Why?

564
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,620
Xu Feng.

565
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,240
Jin Mi.

566
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,160
I hope to meet you

567
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,540
at the midnight in the hall

568
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,260
to talk something about Jin Mi.

569
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,120
When will you let me go?

570
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,300
Never.

571
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,520
You’re the princess of the Demon Realm.

572
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,060
Why do you waste time on me?

573
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,040
You deserve it.

574
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,880
I,

575
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,220
I didn’t hurt your friend,

576
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,980
so

577
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,840
I won’t let you look down upon me.

578
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,700
Finally, you’re the Mu Ci I know.

579
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,680
Where have you been these days?

580
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,760
Why did you make another Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

581
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,900
Originally, I wanted to kill Jin Mi

582
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,360
to deal with Autopsy Wild Silkworms
by Heavenly Empress.

583
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
However, at the last moment,

584
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,520
suddenly I felt that

585
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
I would rather die

586
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,500
than let you down.

587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,540
I...

588
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,640
Don’t worry.

589
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,520
I’ll try to save you.
