1
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,800
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,560
"Episode 10"

3
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,982
The saying goes, parents know
their children best.

4
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:25,067
But my son is not on the same boat with me.

5
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,525
I don't know what for
I'm doing all these.

6
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,440
His Highness will understand...
your thoughts one day.

7
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,067
But now

8
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,960
the people around him are all sceptical

9
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,125
The Princess of Bian City, Liu Ying
has only met with His Highness for a few days.

10
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,177
Yet she's already calling
him Brother Feng.

11
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,004
She doesn't care if he will

12
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:45,799
be criticised by
others in Heaven Realm.

13
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:48,962
It's just a demon's trick.
Don't mind that.

14
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,649
What's your opinion on
Xu Feng getting injured...

15
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,023
in Demon Realm?

16
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,146
I think something is fishy.

17
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:00,343
With the prince's cultivation,

18
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,524
he won't be injured so easily.

19
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:05,190
I believe Liu Ying is
not someone ordinary.

20
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,323
She wouldn't let someone from Heaven
Realm who provides help to get hurt.

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,456
In my opinion,

22
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:13,649
there's another story behind this.

23
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:16,563
Go check it out at Demon Realm.

24
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,085
Watch out for Qiong Qi
and the 3 Demon Kings.

25
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,511
See if Run Yu is colluding
with them secretly.

26
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,964
And report it to me.

27
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,703
Yes, aunt.

28
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,107
Princess, I've brought him here.

29
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,772
Greetings, Princess Sui He.

30
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:36,112
So you're the soldier that...

31
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,184
came late for conscription
and was taken by Xuanji Palace?

32
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:44,107
Yes, I am.
Is there anything you need me for?

33
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:51,856
Well, is Night Immortal
treating you right?

34
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,599
Yes.

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,965
How?

36
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,847
He only appears at night and
always keeps to himself.

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,570
Although I seldom see him,

38
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:05,140
he's quite good to fairies like us.

39
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:07,169
He always greets us.

40
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,008
Is this even good treatment?

41
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,524
Do you want to work for Fire Immortal?

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
Help me with this,

43
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,440
and I'll get you there.

44
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:21,773
Choose anywhere you like
at Divine Army Mansion.

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,124
As for your position,

46
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,268
as long as it's not a
high-ranking position,

47
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,541
you may choose whichever
position you like.

48
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,656
What do you want me to do, princess?

49
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,524
Keep an eye on the Night Immortal.

50
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,402
Every move he makes,

51
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,235
the people he meets
and things he says,

52
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,732
tell me everything regardless
of its importance.

53
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,482
Is it hard?

54
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,020
You'd have a promising future if
you work under Fire Immortal.

55
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,872
This big fortune
is wanted badly by other immortals.

56
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,143
What good have I done...

57
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,142
to deserve such a big fortune.

58
00:04:57,649 --> 00:04:59,924
I heard that Fire Immortal is
very strict with the army.

59
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:03,492
He personally picks
his own soldiers.

60
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:07,772
So, why is it that you
have the power...

61
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,190
to pick the soldiers, Princess Sui He?

62
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't you worry about that.

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,504
I'm a person of my word.

64
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,288
Actually, on conscription day,

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,712
it wasn't because I came late
that I had to go to Xuanji Palace.

66
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:25,989
I went there on my own will.

67
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,077
You're so lacking ambition.

68
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:31,357
So, you're not doing it, huh?

69
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,649
Everybody has his own aspiration.
Please forgive me, princess.

70
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,319
If you don't obey me today,

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,019
you'll be offending me.

72
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:41,613
Which means,
offending the Heavenly Empress.

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,212
Princess, you mean...

74
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:48,498
it's the Heavenly Empress's will
to keep an eye on Night Immortal?

75
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:49,992
Certainly.

76
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,649
It's only until today that I know...

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,754
why Xuanji Palace is so cheerless...

78
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,956
with only a few people.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,468
So, it's because...

80
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,408
the Heavenly Empress is
treating you like this.

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,592
During these thousands of years,

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,334
none of them had
gone through the test.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,257
They were all kicked out by me.

84
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,218
Aren't you afraid of
the Heavenly Empress?

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,635
I am.

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,439
But everyone has his own ambition.
They can't force me.

87
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,031
Moreover, I don't know how to lie.

88
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,374
I'd certainly expose myself.

89
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,676
But I've never wanted to betray you.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,480
You have to believe me, Your Highness.

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,045
Kuang Lu, thank you.

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,073
I hope that you will...

93
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,760
trust me like the way
you trust the beast of dream.

94
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:53,723
The Heavenly Empress is
still very suspicious of you.

95
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:55,634
It's hard to protect yourself.

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,682
You must be careful, Your Highness.

97
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,711
I've got used to it. It's okay.

98
00:07:03,103 --> 00:07:05,143
As long as she can't find my mistake,

99
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,026
she can't do anything to me.

100
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,661
If only there's meteor.

101
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:26,689
If there is meteor,

102
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,125
maybe the phoenix will be here.

103
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,794
Meteor.

104
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,356
Phoenix!

105
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,980
- Phoe...
- You're indeed bored, huh?

106
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:46,255
Fish Fairy, why are you here?

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,897
I came here without
informing beforehand,

108
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,676
please don't be angry.

109
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,320
What are you talking about?
I'm idle these few days.

110
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,066
You're most welcome to come here
to relieve my boredom.

111
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,224
You must be worrying about Xu Feng.

112
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,019
He's fine now.

113
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,633
He is recuperating at Qiwu Palace.

114
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,761
This time,
it's all thanks to you, Jin Mi.

115
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,285
Luckily he's fine.

116
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,905
I was so worried about him.

117
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:15,677
I was just thinking that...

118
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,869
if there's a meteor,
maybe the phoenix will be here.

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,319
That's why I thought that
the meteor was Phoenix.

120
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,456
So, do you like it?

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,656
Yes, I do.

122
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,174
It's so beautiful.

123
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,949
Fish Fairy,

124
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,960
can you take me out of the Water Mirror?

125
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,384
I want to see the outside world.

126
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:04,062
Okay.

127
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,244
Yay!

128
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,717
That's great!

129
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,028
We're out.

130
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,098
You're so amazing, Fish Fairy!

131
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,917
The barrier can't be broken
by needles or water.

132
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:26,657
Fruits like us...

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,116
can only come out after
cultivating for 10,000 years.

134
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:30,399
Even Lao Hu has to...

135
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:32,592
chant the water-breaking spell
for a very long time.

136
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,537
But you,
you managed to bring me out so easily.

137
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,119
You'll indeed have a great future.

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,364
There's nothing special.
You've overpraised me.

139
00:09:43,157 --> 00:09:44,240
Let's go, then.

140
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,000
This way.

141
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,751
King, the Heavenly Emperor
promised to...

142
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,028
attack the Demon Lord
after Qiong Qi's incident.

143
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,412
But nothing has happened until now.

144
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,718
The Heavenly Emperor...

145
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:11,307
is still unreliable.

146
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,468
In the war between Heaven
and Demon ages ago,

147
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:15,715
he did not keep his promises
but abandoned us.

148
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:16,907
If it weren't for you,

149
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:19,034
how did he become
the Emperor so easily?

150
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,685
If I'd known earlier,
I wouldn't trouble myself...

151
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,307
to let Qiong Qi go.

152
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,204
Now that Heaven Realm
had taken Qiong Qi back,

153
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,240
the Demon Realm has suffered
a great loss.

154
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,586
If that's the case,

155
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,571
your plan to eliminate Demon Lord
has come to nothing.

156
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:45,363
We can't rush in seizing
the title of Demon Lord.

157
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,142
About that throne,

158
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,484
I have my own way to get it.

159
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,909
Heavenly Emperor is very ambitious.
Heaven and Demon Realms...

160
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,426
can't satisfy his greed.

161
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:00,272
So now,

162
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,282
we can't fuss over our losses.

163
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,701
Since the Heavenly Emperor
has taken Qiong Qi,

164
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,320
I'll let him fight at the front.

165
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,722
When the time comes,

166
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,855
I will definitely rule
over the six realms.

167
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:19,595
You're almighty.

168
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,565
According to the scout we
sent to Demon Realm,

169
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:41,756
His Highness was indeed hurt by
Qiong Qi.

170
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,742
The 3 kings in Demon Realm have
no contact with Night Immortal.

171
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:48,078
I have thought too highly of him.

172
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,416
But of the people who went
to Demon Realm,

173
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,442
there was also the grape fairy,
Jin Mi,

174
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,563
other than Night Immortal.

175
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,594
You mean...

176
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,675
she has something to do
with Xu Feng's injury?

177
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,125
Was Jin Mi...

178
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:09,186
Xu Feng's reading assistant
at Qiwu Palace?

179
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:11,433
You even praised her before.

180
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:13,352
I was careless.

181
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,892
Back then, Chief Peony
stopped providing food...

182
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:17,963
to the bird tribe
because of a lost flower fairy.

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,033
I found out later that
the fairy was Jin Mi.

184
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,435
I see, it was her.

185
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,187
Go on.

186
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,158
The strange thing is...

187
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,939
Qiong Qi was sealed inside
Soul Cauldron by His Highness...

188
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,269
with Nine Luminaries Fire Seal,

189
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,587
but who knows he was still
able to escape the cauldron.

190
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,348
When Qiong Qi attacked him
with plague needle,

191
00:12:39,494 --> 00:12:40,786
Jin Mi was in the room too.

192
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:44,185
But no one knows
what actually happened in there.

193
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:45,976
I think...

194
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,294
Jin Mi definitely has something
to do with this.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,280
What's even stranger is that....

196
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,451
when His Highness was
injured by plague needle,

197
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,836
only Night Rattan could save him.

198
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:56,881
But Night Rattan...

199
00:12:57,624 --> 00:13:00,332
Night Rattan is Flora
Realm's sacred object.

200
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,445
But the Heaven and Floral Realms...

201
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,708
have had grudges
for thousands of years,

202
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,842
they would never save Xu Feng.

203
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,402
However,

204
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:13,768
they actually saved him with it.

205
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,105
This matter doesn't seem to be simple.

206
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,137
What is the Floral Realm's motive?

207
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,165
You've worked hard. Go get some rest.

208
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,090
Keep this a secret before it's clear.

209
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:30,789
Yes.

210
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:53,135
Go and check on a grape fairy
named Jin Mi at Floral Realm.

211
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,828
Yes.

212
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,701
Heavenly Empress,
everything is normal in Floral Realm,

213
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,356
except for one place.

214
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,955
I found that within
the Water Mirror Barrier,

215
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,064
there's a courtyard...

216
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,904
that was sealed by a powerful
Peony spell.

217
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:36,146
I was afraid I'd alarm the chiefs,
so I did not go in.

218
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:41,784
I'll have to go to Floral Realm
myself to find out then.

219
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,515
Chief Peony,

220
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,949
Xu Feng was seriously poisoned
while subduing Qiong Qi days ago.

221
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,257
Luckily you were generous enough
to heal Xu Feng with Night Rattan.

222
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,551
I'm here to thank you today.

223
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,035
I brought you a gift,
please accept it.

224
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,137
You're welcome, Heavenly Empress.

225
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,749
It was all fate.

226
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,817
It seems that his time
hasn't come yet.

227
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,176
As for your appreciation,

228
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,444
that is too much.
I can't bear it.

229
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:27,973
Everyone in Floral Realm
does not dare to accept it.

230
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:31,971
I heard that there's...

231
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:35,144
a grape fairy called Jin Mi
here in Floral Realm.

232
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,952
She was also there when
Xu Feng was wounded by Qiong Qi.

233
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,039
Can I see her?

234
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,744
I'm afraid I have to say no.

235
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:46,180
Jin Mi has made a big mistake.

236
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,317
She's repenting,
won't be seeing anyone.

237
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,639
Fire Immortal was attacked,

238
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:56,545
I think it's more appropriate
if you ask him yourself.

239
00:17:56,852 --> 00:18:00,352
What wrong did
Jin Mi do exactly...

240
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:02,435
to receive such a heavy punishment?

241
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:05,984
The Heaven Realm has no right to
intervene in Floral Realm's business.

242
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,308
Especially someone like you,
Heavenly Empress.

243
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,676
What do you think?

244
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,609
We're busy here.
There are a lot of jobs to do.

245
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,150
Please leave.

246
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:24,228
I won't disturb you anymore then.
See you again.

247
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,924
Heavenly Empress,
do we go back to Heaven Realm now?

248
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,514
Chief Peony kept on stopping me,

249
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,060
and even ordered me to leave.

250
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,452
It's obvious that she's
covering something up.

251
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,468
From the way she's acting,

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,080
I feel more like seeing Jin Mi
and see who exactly she is.

253
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:57,204
Heavenly Empress,
you actually lowered yourself...

254
00:19:57,459 --> 00:20:00,334
trying to break into a fairy's room?

255
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:04,942
Where would Heaven Realm put
its face if others know about this?

256
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Who exactly is Jin Mi?

257
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,227
You even set a double-layer barrier
to trap her here.

258
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,314
It's none of your business.

259
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:27,882
Jin Mi.

260
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:45,536
Your Highness.

261
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,334
Your Highness.

262
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:52,702
It's you.

263
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,729
How are you?

264
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,882
Why don't you stay inside the palace?

265
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:00,709
I'm fine now. I need some air.

266
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,317
Are you troubled?

267
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,700
You seem to immerse
in thought just now.

268
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:12,544
Just tell me if there's
anything troubling you.

269
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:14,602
I can share it with you.

270
00:21:16,393 --> 00:21:17,808
This is all fate.

271
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:23,060
The so-called trouble
sounds more like a joke.

272
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,672
Your Highness.

273
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,334
Are you worried about Jin Mi?

274
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:44,227
I'm afraid I'm not even
qualified to worry about her.

275
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,518
What a pity grape.

276
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,043
Jin Mi.

277
00:22:28,077 --> 00:22:30,157
Fish Fairy, you're here?

278
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:31,789
Jin Mi,

279
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:33,735
am I disturbing you?

280
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,276
No, no. Why would that be?

281
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:38,803
You seem sullen,

282
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:42,356
is it because of Xuanji Palace's
poor hospitality?

283
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,101
No, this place is great.

284
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,784
Everybody has taken great care of me.

285
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:51,545
Is there anything troubling you?

286
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,128
It's not quite so.

287
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:57,366
But after I parted with
Xu Feng the other day,

288
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,275
I've never seen him anymore.

289
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:01,017
I wonder how his condition is.

290
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
I want to visit him.

291
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:04,936
I see. You're sullen because of this.

292
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,106
Don't worry, Jin Mi.

293
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,011
I just visited him at Qiwu Palace.

294
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,402
So how? How is he?

295
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:13,213
Did he mention about me?

296
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,099
After taking the Night Rattan,

297
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:16,568
he's basically fine.

298
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:19,246
It's just that at this moment,
everybody is queuing up...

299
00:23:19,348 --> 00:23:20,988
in front of Qiwu Palace to visit him.

300
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:22,232
It's very crowded there.

301
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:24,424
If you go there now,

302
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:25,897
you'll be attracting attention.

303
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,218
Then the fact that you're
hiding in Heaven Realm...

304
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:30,751
can no longer be kept hidden.

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
You're right, Fish Fairy.

306
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,854
It's better if I don't visit him now.

307
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,518
I'll go some other time.

308
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,536
Fish Fairy, the meteor you
showed me the other day...

309
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,166
was too beautiful.

310
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:45,368
I want to see it again.

311
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,452
Just a simple trick,
it wasn't worth mentioning.

312
00:23:47,564 --> 00:23:48,982
If you want,

313
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:51,074
I can show you something
even more special.

314
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:53,577
Something even more special?
Where?

315
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:55,789
After you get out of
Xuanji Palace, go south.

316
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:58,798
There's a milky way near the rainbow.

317
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,347
Milky way?

318
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:02,803
Let's go now.

319
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,953
Come on.

320
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,091
So this is the milky way?

321
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,394
Phenomenal!

322
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,185
I've never seen
such a beautiful place.

323
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:27,016
Fish Fairy, the position you hold...

324
00:24:27,154 --> 00:24:29,945
is good in term of ranking.

325
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,169
But when it comes to joy,

326
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:36,116
I think it's not as good as
Maori Star Guardian.

327
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,634
What do you mean?

328
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,046
Well,

329
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:41,807
Maori Star Guardian is
on duty during the day.

330
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,377
There are sounds of cocks and dogs.
So it's kind of lively.

331
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:45,499
But you,

332
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:48,279
you only have that beast of dream
who can't speak as companion.

333
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:50,692
And everybody has
gone to bed at night.

334
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,075
How cheerless.

335
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,409
You're such a lonely immortal.

336
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,962
Only those who've
experienced liveliness...

337
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,493
understand loneliness.

338
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:05,276
I'm fated to be alone.

339
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:10,606
I eat alone, practise alone,

340
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:13,105
read alone and sleep alone.

341
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,584
Without knowing liveliness,

342
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,269
how'd I know loneliness?

343
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:20,721
Give me your hand.

344
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:26,294
For you.

345
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:28,240
This is the seed of
night-blooming cereus.

346
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,474
It is a flower that
only blooms at night.

347
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,660
In the morning,

348
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:34,040
it mostly sleeps while
closing its flower.

349
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:37,327
I think its habit
is more or less like yours.

350
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:38,635
That's why I gave it to you.

351
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,442
You can accompany
each other from now on.

352
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:41,923
All these years,

353
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,609
the Heaven Realm is full of
flowers transformed by clouds.

354
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:45,910
They will never wilt,

355
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:49,035
but it's still just a trick.
It's not real.

356
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,470
Thanks to you today...

357
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:55,009
that Xuanji Palace is able
to have a real flower.

358
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,350
But you still need to...

359
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,200
water and take good care of it.

360
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,772
I will give it my best.

361
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,579
Hopefully when the night-blooming
cereus blooms,

362
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,332
I can watch its beauty with you.

363
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,542
Sure. No problem.

364
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,392
Fish Fairy, please do me a favour.

365
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:18,762
Just say it.

366
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,033
Can you...

367
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,956
don't take me back to
the Water Mirror today?

368
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,365
I don't want to be
found by Chief Peony.

369
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,311
Is it okay if I stay and
disturb you...

370
00:26:28,475 --> 00:26:29,878
for a few days at Xuanji Palace?

371
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:33,369
Since I've brought you
out of the Water Mirror,

372
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:35,624
I won't take you back.

373
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,426
As long as you don't mind
staying in Xuanji Palace,

374
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,080
that will not be a trouble.

375
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,436
I don't mind. I don't.

376
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,781
But even Phoenix
is afraid of Chief Peony.

377
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,617
Aren't you afraid?

378
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,777
I was disliked by many
people since little.

379
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,779
One more person means nothing.

380
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,021
Your Highness.

381
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:59,985
Your Highness,
I heard that Chief Peony...

382
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:01,789
is here to look for Jin Mi.

383
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,588
What? So fast?

384
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:06,323
No way.
I can't let her find me.

385
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:08,051
Otherwise I'm doomed.

386
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:11,034
Fish Fairy, I need to
quickly hide in your palace now.

387
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:14,144
I'm glad that
you think of Xuanji Palace first...

388
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,044
when you're in trouble.

389
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,560
But I think that
if you wish for a longer freedom,

390
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:23,304
hiding in Heaven Realm
is not the best option.

391
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,927
You're so thoughtful.

392
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,814
But... but I don't know much
about the six realms.

393
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,237
Please tell me what to do.

394
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:34,042
The mortal world is very complicated.

395
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:37,854
It wouldn't be an easy task
to track your scent...

396
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,951
among the mortals.

397
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,139
I was right about you.

398
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:47,745
You're indeed an exceptional
genius in Heaven Realm.

399
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:49,410
I have a lot of faith in you.

400
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:45,843
You actually look
good dressed like this.

401
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,005
Really?

402
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,685
Have a sip.

403
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,199
Although this place is simple and
crude, it's very quiet.

404
00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:55,168
If you're okay with it,

405
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:56,732
you may settle down here.

406
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,430
Thanks, Fish Fairy.

407
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,172
I like this house.
I like it very much.

408
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:06,229
Now you have a house and clothes,

409
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:09,482
but a pseudonym name in mortal world.

410
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:10,911
Pseudonym name?

411
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,970
Call me Mi then.

412
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,720
No. The name
sounds too much like a girl's name.

413
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,122
You're now a gentleman.

414
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,537
How about the name Ling Guang?

415
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,443
Ling Guang?

416
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:27,475
Sounds like brightness.

417
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:30,141
I like it. This is it then.

418
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,163
The Earth Immortal is so speedy.

419
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,728
We've just arrived,
and he's already here.

420
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,900
Just like a cat that got a fish.

421
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,189
He must have come by tracing
the immortal scent.

422
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:48,332
I'm using your place...

423
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,927
without informing you first.
Please forgive me.

424
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:53,039
Your Highness,
your visit to my territory...

425
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:56,483
has showered glory and...

426
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,258
bring colours around here.

427
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,268
Now that I have lived
to see your charming appearance,

428
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:04,068
I feel so lucky...

429
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,900
- and blessed.
- Enough.

430
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,602
This is Mister Ling Guang,
a friend I made recently.

431
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
He has encountered some troubles,

432
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,531
and will be staying here
for a few days.

433
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,832
Please take care of him,
Earth Immortal.

434
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:20,097
Greetings, Mister Ling Guang.

435
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,852
Don't worry, Your Highness.

436
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:24,895
This is my territory.

437
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:26,357
I'm in charge of this place.

438
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:29,756
If someone wishes to harm
Mister Ling Guang,

439
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,328
he'd have to go over my dead body.

440
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:37,885
Before he became an immortal,
he was a mountain thief.

441
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,748
Thanks then, Earth Immortal.

442
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:45,606
My pleasure. I'll take my leave then.

443
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,822
- I want this.
- Give me this.

444
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,713
Sirs, there's only 1 left.

445
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,736
Lord Puchi.

446
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,883
Jin Mi.

447
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,632
Lord Puchi, why are you here?

448
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,398
One gets silly easily when
stays too long in Heaven Realm.

449
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,306
Don't you think so?

450
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,892
That's why
I'm here to see the mortal's faces.

451
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,635
Now,

452
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:47,210
- I'm no longer Jin Mi.
- What are you then?

453
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,650
After I came to mortal world,

454
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:50,353
I have a mortal name.

455
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:51,991
Call me Ling Guang.

456
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,660
Ling Guang?

457
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:55,235
Why?

458
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,701
I made a
a small mistake.

459
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:02,451
I was locked up and asked to
repent by Chief Peony.

460
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,118
But I escaped.

461
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,160
After a careful thought,
I think this is the safest place.

462
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,188
Chief Peony will never find me here.

463
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:11,190
I see.

464
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:13,548
Then, do you have a place to stay?

465
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,368
Do you need me to find one for you?

466
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,331
Never mind. I've had one.

467
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:19,052
Fish Fairy had everything done for me.

468
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:21,293
Fish Fairy?

469
00:32:21,404 --> 00:32:23,857
When did Heaven Realm
have this position?

470
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,440
It's the Night Immortal.
He's a very nice guy.

471
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:29,108
It's he who helped me escaped.

472
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:30,876
He even found a house for me.

473
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:33,761
But he's gone back to Heaven Realm.

474
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:38,094
Oh right. You're free anyway.

475
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:40,144
Why not I bring you to visit my house?

476
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,132
It's not as colourful as Floral Realm,

477
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,617
or as elegant as Heaven Realm,

478
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
but it is special.

479
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,760
- Great. Let's go.
- Come on.

480
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,461
"Luoxiang Mansion"

481
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,022
Are you paying respect to Zi Fen?

482
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,796
Can you pour me a cup of wine too?

483
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,073
Thank you.

484
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,274
Zi Fen loved Osmanthus wine the most.

485
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,442
All these years,

486
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,343
I've been dreaming about her.

487
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:37,293
In my dream,
she was still the old her.

488
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:41,415
Smiling,

489
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,188
but with tears in her eyes.

490
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:47,223
The past has passed.
There's no use to bring it up.

491
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,974
May I know why are you here,
Your Majesty?

492
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,880
The Heavenly Empress' birthday
is in a few days' time.

493
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,250
I know that...

494
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,661
you and Lin Xiu are
indifferent to fame,

495
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,392
nor do you like crowded place.

496
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:04,664
But the Heavenly Empress
is over sensitive.

497
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,838
She might think you are upset of her.

498
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,978
All the immortals have been
talking behind us as well.

499
00:34:11,494 --> 00:34:12,536
So I hope that...

500
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,839
in her birthday banquet
a few days later,

501
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:18,568
you and Lin Xiu
will be there no matter what.

502
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:22,200
Since you have personally
come to invite me,

503
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:26,566
Lin Xiu and I will definitely go.

504
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,169
Okay.

505
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
You guys...

506
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,318
have kept my son waited for long.

507
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,711
The marriage was
arranged since 4000 years ago.

508
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:39,069
But where's your daughter?

509
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:46,500
What? Mother went to Floral Realm
to look for Jin Mi?

510
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,526
But what was unexpected was that...

511
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:50,156
Jin Mi wasn't in Floral Realm.

512
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,063
Even Chief Peony couldn't find her.

513
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,002
What did you say?
Jin Mi has gone missing?

514
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,801
Your Highness, you've just recovered.

515
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,377
Don't get too agitated.

516
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:03,778
Jin Mi...

517
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:07,861
Is Jin Mi that important to you?

518
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Flower Immortals, you can't come in.
You can't...

519
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,643
Your Highness,
they insisted to barge in.

520
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,695
Your Highness.
I was incapable to stop them.

521
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,172
You're done here. You may leave.

522
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,142
- Yes.
- Yes.

523
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,361
Greetings, Chief Peony.

524
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:28,365
You came here in such a rush.

525
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,072
May I know what is it
that's so important?

526
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,683
Fire Immortal,
please hand over Jin Mi.

527
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,600
I think you've misunderstood.

528
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:36,811
Jin Mi is not in Qiwu Palace.

529
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,345
Jin Mi suddenly disappeared
from the Water Mirror.

530
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:41,743
Besides you,

531
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,485
I can't think of anyone
who is able to take her away.

532
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,065
Jin Mi is from Floral Realm.

533
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,469
If you've taken her,

534
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:50,967
please return her to us.

535
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:52,813
Since I've promised you...

536
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,080
I won't see her in
Floral Realm anymore,

537
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,723
I will never break my promise.

538
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:00,003
I was just about to look for her
since I've also just learnt that...

539
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:01,148
she's missing.

540
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:02,713
We've all agreed that...

541
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,705
it was Fire Immortal
who took Jin Mi away.

542
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:07,229
Nonsense!

543
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,560
You lost a person from Floral Realm,

544
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,678
yet you come here to Heaven Realm...

545
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,731
and blame Xu Feng?

546
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:17,916
The person you're
looking for is not here.

547
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,369
Even if you bring this to
the Heavenly Emperor,

548
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,868
the answer's still the same.

549
00:36:24,372 --> 00:36:25,967
Please leave, Chief Peony.

550
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,779
As for Jin Mi, I'll find her.

551
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:48,802
"Fuxiang Restaurant"

552
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,555
Mister Ling Guang,
you've no idea that...

553
00:36:55,689 --> 00:36:58,940
the best dish to go with wine is duck.

554
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,352
One sip of yellow wine...

555
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:03,316
with 2 bites of osmanthus duck.

556
00:37:05,313 --> 00:37:08,313
This makes one's life perfect.
Perfect.

557
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,853
Here.

558
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:20,084
That's too strong.
Why is mortal's wine so strong?

559
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:23,090
But speaking of this wine,

560
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,414
the wine in mortal world...

561
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,727
when compared to the wine
brewed by an immortal like Yan You,

562
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,494
it's...

563
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,630
What do we call that?

564
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,522
It's just like diluted cat pee,

565
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:39,797
not presentable at all.

566
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,137
Three, two, one.

567
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,276
Done.

568
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,000
Even when the rich
are born into the mortal world,

569
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,028
they'd end up with a befuddled life
but not a desired life.

570
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,670
The 4 greatest pleasures
in one's life...

571
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:57,924
are none other than...

572
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,690
eating, drinking,
playing and enjoying.

573
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:05,180
Mi, can you get used to
the life in mortal world?

574
00:38:06,388 --> 00:38:08,119
During these few days
I'm in mortal world,

575
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:09,868
Fish Fairy had been
keeping me company.

576
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:11,291
He is on duty at night.

577
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,388
Besides taking a nap during the day,

578
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:17,353
he'd play chess, zither or
discuss about books and poems with me.

579
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,993
I wasn't so boring.

580
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:20,810
Night Immortal...

581
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,356
is indeed careful and thoughtful.

582
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,139
He had been taking good care of you.

583
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,242
That's for sure.

584
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:28,782
But, Lord Puchi,

585
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,772
you were talking about eating,
drinking, playing and enjoying.

586
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:33,356
Let's put aside eating and drinking.

587
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:35,521
What's so special about
playing and enjoying?

588
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,536
I'm new here,

589
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:41,242
I need you to teach me, Lord Puchi.

590
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,617
Let me tell you.

591
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,704
Everything about the heaven is good,

592
00:38:45,102 --> 00:38:48,327
except that it's too boring.
No fun at all.

593
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:50,322
Such a rare place is of course good.

594
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,596
But,

595
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:55,616
it's not as enjoyable
as the fun in mortal world.

596
00:38:56,144 --> 00:38:57,977
I'll bring you to have fun now.

597
00:38:58,642 --> 00:39:00,390
Thanks then.

598
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:10,602
Do you know what does having fun mean?

599
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:12,863
I...

600
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,185
I'll take you to experience
the real fun today.

601
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:18,529
Okay. We're here.

602
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:23,443
Isn't... isn't this just
a cloth store?

603
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:25,415
You'll know when you get in there.

604
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:26,958
Come on.

605
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:35,823
Boss,

606
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:38,296
any fresh fish to sell?

607
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,672
Sirs, please follow me.

608
00:39:41,787 --> 00:39:42,917
Come on.

609
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,644
Watch out the steps.

610
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,635
Please hold on,
I'll get someone for you.

611
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,842
Okay.

612
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,520
To gamble in big amount with
many skillful people,

613
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,881
you have to find the right place.

614
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:16,077
An underground gambling house
is the best.

615
00:40:24,428 --> 00:40:25,438
Bingo.

616
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,397
"Gamble"

617
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,516
I won.

618
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,525
I won!

619
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:42,758
Just leave.

620
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,960
Go away.

621
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:45,708
Go.

622
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,494
Mister, we're doing small business.

623
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,839
We can't withstand torture from
a skillful person like you.

624
00:40:50,939 --> 00:40:52,868
Please don't ruin my business.

625
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,729
Thank you very much.

626
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,743
This is weird.

627
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:00,346
Playing mahjong is so boring.

628
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:03,011
In a game, winning and
losing makes it fun.

629
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:06,130
Like when I was playing
chess with Fish Fairy,

630
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:07,410
he'd take 2 of my piece...

631
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:08,744
while I capture 5 of his piece.

632
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,807
It's more interesting if
we take turn in winning.

633
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:13,086
But in mahjong,

634
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,733
I got whichever tile I wished for...

635
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,128
and won every time.

636
00:41:17,507 --> 00:41:19,307
Besides getting these heavy objects...

637
00:41:19,431 --> 00:41:21,483
in yellow and white,

638
00:41:21,588 --> 00:41:22,868
it's not interesting at all.

639
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:24,987
This is not fun. Let's go.
