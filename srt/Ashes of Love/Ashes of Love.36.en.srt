1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,540
"Episode 36"

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,440
Jin Mi.

4
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,560
Jin Mi.

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Have a look. I got something interesting.

6
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,920
I didn’t expect that such a piece of thin paper

7
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,500
can be made into a shape of phoenix.

8
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,540
I planned to open it to have a look

9
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,020
and learn the skill to make a paper phoenix.

10
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,080
However, this paper phoenix

11
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,660
is injected with magic power.

12
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,240
We can’t open it.

13
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,860
How amazing it is!

14
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,860
Let’s meet and drink osmanthus wine together

15
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,840
by Liuzi Pond tonight.

16
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,200
What is written on it?

17
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Did,

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,140
did you hear

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,180
or see anything?

20
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,460
No.

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,740
-I heard nothing.
-What did you hear?

22
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,080
Nothing.

23
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,040
I’m relieved then.

24
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,840
Who are you?

25
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,120
Princess of Bian City.

26
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,960
I want to visit the Qiwu Palace.

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,820
Your Highness.

28
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,100
His Highness, Fire Immortal
has been grounded by His Majesty now.

29
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,020
I’m afraid you can’t meet him.

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
I have something important to tell him.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
It turns out that it was
the descendant of Spirit-Vanishing Family

32
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,460
who assassinated Jin Mi.

33
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,040
He’s Mu Ci, a member of Spirit-Vanishing Family.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,940
A member of Spirit-Vanishing Family?

35
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,100
No wonder he has a Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,380
The Spirit-Vanishing Arrow is cast
with his bones and blood.

37
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,720
Once it is made, it’ll cause
Nether Fury of Wangchuan River.

38
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,260
If he isn’t threatened,

39
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,480
he won’t cast the arrow at the risk of

40
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,420
being spotted by the Demon Family.

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Moreover,

42
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,500
Mu Ci was absolutely not a person
who knew nothing of good or evil before.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,720
I just saw a shadow entering Zifangyun Palace.

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Is Mother in danger?

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Her Majesty is safe.

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,880
But I overheard a conversation

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,540
between that man and Her Majesty.

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,560
Her Majesty intentionally
sent you to Wangchuan River

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
and wanted to

50
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,440
kill Jin Mi furtively in the mortal world.

51
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,480
If we can find the one
who has threatened Mu Ci,

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
we can know who wants to kill Jin Mi.

53
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
I can save Mu Ci as well.

54
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,660
It’s concerning the life of Jin Mi.

55
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,220
I’ll definitely find out the truth.

56
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,560
But what Mu Ci has done…

57
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,720
Xu Feng,

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,220
can you spare his life for the sake of me

59
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,740
as he once saved me
and is a man good by nature?

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,520
I know without you,

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,220
Jin Mi must have been dead.

62
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,980
You saved her and I owed you a life.

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,680
Don’t worry.

64
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,320
If there is any message of Mu Ci,

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,900
I’ll be sure to inform you of it in time.

66
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,900
Thank you.

67
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,420
One more thing,

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,140
you must watch out for demon King of Gu City.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
When you experienced hardships
in the mortal world,

70
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
he once wanted to seize the
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow to harm you.

71
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:39,840
Fine.

72
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,280
I haven’t seen him for a long time.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,980
Now I have become an immortal again.

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,500
He’s less likely to harm me.

75
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,960
I’ve got to go.

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,820
Lord Liaoyuan.

77
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Your Highness.

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,920
Assist Princess Liu Ying

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
in looking for Mu Ci in the dark.

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,660
This may be related to Mother.

81
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,740
Keep an eye on this

82
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,300
and find Mu Ci as soon as possible.

83
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,180
Send for Mother.

84
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,100
Yes.

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,820
Xu.

86
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,860
You have suffered a lot.

87
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,440
You can’t do that again.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,220
I can’t fall asleep at night

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
when thinking about
your suffering in the mortal world.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,420
What’s more,

91
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,900
others will surely gossip about you

92
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,180
after you experienced hardships
with Jin Mi in the mortal world.

93
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,760
Don’t ever do such a silly thing again.

94
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,240
Even if they gossip about me,

95
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,500
I’ll bear it.

96
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,600
Nonsense.

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,140
What’s special about Jin Mi?

98
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,000
Why did you chase after her again and again?

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
You can see that

100
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,240
no matter whether I’m a mortal or an immortal,

101
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,920
I only love Jin Mi.

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,900
Don’t try to change my mind.

103
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Did you forget?

104
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,620
Did you forget the wedding day
of Run Yu and Jin Mi has been decided?

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
If you keep acting recklessly,

106
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,160
you’ll become a joke in the Heaven Realm.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,740
I’ve worked hard to pave the way for you.

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,000
You can’t go on like that.

109
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to ask you about something.

110
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Is the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

111
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,620
related to you?

112
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
All right.

113
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,900
You question me today

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
for Jin Mi.

115
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,260
You really disappoint me.

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,220
Do you want to break my heart?

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Do you want to break my heart?

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,824
Why did you insist on killing the one I love
with the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

119
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,980
Where did you get that rumor?

120
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,920
How dare they slandered me
I’m related to the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow?

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,538
If you didn’t want to assassinate Jin Mi

122
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:50,540
when she experienced hardships
in the mortal world,

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,660
I wouldn’t have experienced hardships
in the mortal world too.

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,660
If you killed Jin Mi,

125
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,060
I would be dead too.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,960
How come you’re so stupid?

127
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,720
I have to remind you that

128
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,620
if you’re still

129
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,220
obsessed with Jin Mi,

130
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
you’ll regret someday.

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,020
Since that Jin Mi is safe and sound now,

132
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,180
I can let it go.

133
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,100
If anything happens to Jin Mi,

134
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,180
I’ll never turn a blind eye to it.

135
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,240
You…

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,020
Your Highness, please stay.

137
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,680
Lord Liaoyuan, what’s going on?

138
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
His Highness ordered me

139
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
to assist you in looking for Mu Ci,

140
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,180
but I have never seen Mu Ci,

141
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,820
so I don’t know his look.

142
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,060
Please instruct.

143
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,960
I was confused. I even forgot it.

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,820
Wait a minute.

145
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,140
He usually wears a mask.

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,660
Thank you, Your Highness.

147
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,040
I should thank you.

148
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,180
Thank you.

149
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,440
My pleasure.

150
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
His Highness told me

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
he can’t go out freely,

152
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,520
so I’m at your service.

153
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,020
I’ll do my best to help you.

154
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,115
Xu Feng is considerate and warmhearted.

155
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,574
I can never repay his kindness.

156
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,400
By the way, Your Highness,

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,420
do you know this object?

158
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,580
Where did you get this seal?

159
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,980
When I experienced hardships
with His Highness in the mortal world,

160
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,340
I helped a strange person by accident.

161
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
This seal was given by that person.

162
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
He even cast

163
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,100
a following spell on it.

164
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,460
When I was in the mortal world,

165
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,200
it never left me.

166
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,700
This spell wasn’t broken
until I returned to the heaven.

167
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,120
It seems to be an object of
Demon Realm based on its shape.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,040
This seal

169
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,020
is indeed made of
demon iron of Demon Realm,

170
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,700
but I don’t know

171
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,100
whom it belongs to.

172
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,120
Since it is an object of Demon Realm,

173
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,140
it’s better to be kept by you.

174
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,060
No.

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,460
This was given to you by others.

176
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,080
How can I keep it for you?

177
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,260
That man promised that

178
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,900
I could fulfill a wish

179
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,880
with this object,

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
but I just did him a small favor

181
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,840
and wanted nothing in return.

182
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,980
You can bring it back to Demon Realm.

183
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,720
Maybe you can meet its owner

184
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,060
and return it to him

185
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,220
or ask him to do you a favor
when you need it.

186
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,900
It’s better for you to keep it.

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,040
Fine.

188
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,740
I’ll ask about it for you.

189
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,380
Now you’re in the Heaven Realm.

190
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,060
If you’re found by Xu Feng and others,

191
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
you’ll be in great trouble.

192
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
Go to hide in the
underground palace of the mortal world

193
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,020
and don’t go out

194
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,240
without my order.

195
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,140
How about Autopsy Wild Silkworms?

196
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.

197
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,560
How beautiful.

198
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,760
How did you

199
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,440
bring them to the Heaven Realm?

200
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,960
I’ve cast a spell on them

201
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,540
and they’ll never go off.

202
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,140
You can visit Liuzi Pond
whenever you want.

203
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
That one is so ugly.

204
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,060
Why did you bring it here too?

205
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,020
Instead, I feel this lantern

206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
is the most beautiful
among all the Phoenix Lanterns,

207
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,260
because it contains our memory.

208
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
This is the memory of Saint Girl and King Yi.

209
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
What a beautiful view!

210
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,480
It’ll be great

211
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,540
if we can drink self-made osmanthus wine.

212
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,519
In fact,

213
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:53,021
before I descended to the mortal world,

214
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,080
I buried osmanthus wine I made here.

215
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,000
I dug it out several days ago.

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,280
Let’s try your wine today.

217
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,260
The wine you made
is indeed savory and mellow.

218
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
I must have some skill
to live among six realms.

219
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,280
Why are you staring at me like that?

220
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,480
It’s great that

221
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,360
I don’t need to look at you through the veil.

222
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,688
<i>From the love letter, </i>

223
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,525
<i>I find the places
where we will meet in each life.</i>

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,540
<i>I will wait for you there…</i>

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Is it beautiful?

226
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,908
<i>From the love letter,</i>

227
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:37,220
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>

228
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,660
<i>I will sing there, </i>

229
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

230
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,628
<i>From the love letter, </i>

231
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:48,756
<i>I find the places
where we made wishes in each life</i>

232
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,980
<i>and plant a red lotus to perfume time.</i>

233
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,681
<i>From the love letter, </i>

234
00:12:56,973 --> 00:13:00,643
<i>I find the places
where we fell in love in each life.</i>

235
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,437
<i>I will sing there, </i>

236
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:06,232
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

237
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,780
When in the mortal world,

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,580
you promised to marry me.

239
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,180
Will you keep your promise?

240
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,560
But…

241
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

242
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,820
But I’m engaged to Fish Fairy.

243
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,580
What if you’re not engaged to him?

244
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,380
Will you keep your promise?

245
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,920
I’ll explain to Daddy

246
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,340
and ask him to break off my engagement.

247
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,220
By that time,

248
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,360
by that time I’ll…

249
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,440
What will you do?

250
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,060
By that time

251
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
I’ll keep my promise.

252
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,560
Can you repeat

253
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,720
what you said just now?

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,560
I said

255
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,800
by that time

256
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,880
I’ll keep my promise.

257
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,540
<i>I hope to wash away the vanity,</i>

258
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,080
<i>wipe the dust on me</i>

259
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,760
<i>and get drunk with you again</i>

260
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,240
<i>with a pot of clear wine.</i>

261
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,620
<i>A pot of clear wine and the dust on me.</i>

262
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,340
<i>As I recall it, the rest of my life has no regrets.</i>

263
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:15,720
<i>People come and go in my life
despite the vanity and right and wrong.</i>

264
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,760
<i>I will get drunk again when flowers bloom.</i>

265
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,647
"Qiwu Palace"

266
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,660
Xu Feng, you’re so delighted.

267
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,380
It seems that

268
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,900
you’re glad to get grounded.

269
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,220
Stop joking.

270
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,720
Tell me what happened to you.

271
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,580
You think too much.

272
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,836
Tell me.

273
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:23,837
Something good must have happened.

274
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,860
Uncle,

275
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,740
I have something to ask you today.

276
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,840
Go ahead.

277
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,900
It’s about the birth mother of Night Immortal.

278
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,942
Can you tell me in detail?

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
King of Gu City doesn’t know
you have returned to Demon Realm.

280
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,600
I think you can’t hide from him for a long time.

281
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,485
You’d better stay away from here.

282
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,600
Why should I leave?

283
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,714
I must report it to Demon Lord

284
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:40,800
and ask Demon Lord to deal with King of Gu City.

285
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,000
King of Gu City is very flattering

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,485
and trusted by Demon Lord.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,342
Do you think Demon Lord will punish him?

288
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:49,771
It makes sense.

289
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,942
That good-for-nothing is
never able to distinguish right and wrong.

290
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:54,685
Nonsense.

291
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:56,571
Leave with me.

292
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:58,628
I have a lot of things to handle in the Demon Realm

293
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:00,457
and can’t leave.

294
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,028
King of Gu City

295
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:02,742
won’t let you go.

296
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,828
He always wants to defeat you.

297
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:09,314
I won’t be defeated by him.

298
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,057
Who is that?

299
00:19:14,628 --> 00:19:15,771
Mu Ci.

300
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:18,971
His Highness said

301
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,857
this man is temporarily handed over to you.

302
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,514
Hope you can look after him.

303
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,457
If the heaven court needs his witnesses,

304
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,628
he should speak the truth.

305
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:29,200
I’m extremely grateful to His Highness.

306
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,571
Please tell His Highness

307
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,685
I won’t disappoint him.

308
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:34,571
Thank you.

309
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,542
I’m leaving.

310
00:19:55,714 --> 00:20:00,000
It seems that no one can leave now.

311
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:01,828
Father,

312
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,457
what on earth happened to Mu Ci?

313
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:09,428
Autopsy Wild Silkworms are planted in his body.

314
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,285
Autopsy Wild Silkworms?

315
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,714
Can they be removed?

316
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:15,314
This magic

317
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,942
is said to continue the life of someone dying.

318
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,971
When the silkworms exist, he exists, or he’ll die.

319
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:24,000
Autopsy Wild Silkworms are
divided into the child and the mother.

320
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,685
The mother must be fed with

321
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,142
the blood of the silkworm keeper regularly

322
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,914
and then the mother will feed

323
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,142
the child planted in the body of the host.

324
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:36,171
If the child can’t be fed regularly,

325
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:39,142
it’ll absorb the magic power of the host.

326
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:42,628
To completely remove Autopsy Wild Silkworms,

327
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:45,371
fire magic is needed to refine the child,

328
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:46,857
but I’m afraid that

329
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,971
the host can’t live long in this case.

330
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:50,857
Looking at his situation,

331
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,085
I think Autopsy Wild Silkworms

332
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,714
have absorbed his magic power.

333
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:59,314
He’s indeed forced to do that.

334
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:01,885
Father,

335
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,942
what should we do now?

336
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:04,800
Now

337
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,942
I can only control his situation
for the time being,

338
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,861
but if the child of

339
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,000
Autopsy Wild Silkworms can’t be fed,

340
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:13,257
I’m afraid…

341
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:18,685
Who is so cruel

342
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,600
to use such vicious Autopsy Wild Silkworms

343
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,628
to control Mu Ci?

344
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,171
Autopsy Wild Silkworms

345
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,464
can only be fed with the blood

346
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,457
of those with strong fire magic,

347
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:35,771
and can’t be used by others.

348
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:37,542
Those with strong fire magic

349
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,857
are all in the Heaven Realm.

350
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Honey,

351
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,142
I know you like Mu Ci sincerely,

352
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,371
but he is a member of
Spirit-Vanishing Family after all.

353
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,857
What’s more, he’s somehow

354
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,514
related to the Heaven Realm now.

355
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,800
I just want to ask you a question.

356
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,428
Do you really want to keep him here?

357
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,428
Father,

358
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,171
I must get the former Mu Ci back.

359
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,485
I got it.

360
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:11,600
I’ll figure out a way.

361
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:13,885
You’re safe in the mansion

362
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:15,028
as it is full of our trusted followers,

363
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:17,371
but when you get out alone,

364
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,914
you must be more careful

365
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,514
and not let others of the Demon Realm

366
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:22,114
know Mu Ci is here.

367
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:23,542
Otherwise,

368
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,285
not only Mu Ci, but also we will be in danger.

369
00:22:26,285 --> 00:22:27,371
Do you understand?

370
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,914
Yes.

371
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:32,800
Thank you, Father.

372
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,345
Why do you remove it?

373
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:05,013
We can play chess.

374
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:06,800
When we play chess,

375
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,085
it is always the case that
you win one game and I win one game.

376
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:10,800
It’s not surprising at all,

377
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,114
so it’s meaningless.

378
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,400
Fine.

379
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,057
I’m here

380
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,514
to drink with you today.

381
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,228
I’ve known

382
00:23:28,685 --> 00:23:29,885
what happened to your birth mother.

383
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:32,914
I want to make an apology for Mother

384
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,600
with this glass of wine.

385
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,428
I’m in deep mourning

386
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:39,485
and can’t drink.

387
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:43,371
Sorry.

388
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,114
Mother

389
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:48,742
just killed

390
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,228
an insignificant sinner.

391
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:51,942
You don’t have to make an apology.

392
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:55,028
I know you feel bad.

393
00:23:55,257 --> 00:23:56,171
Your birth mother…

394
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,600
You know nothing.

395
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:03,771
It’s better not to know it.

396
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,885
You’re still grounded.

397
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,800
Don’t make Father and Mother
unhappy again.

398
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,742
Go back.

399
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,085
I want to speak my mind to you.

400
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:20,571
I don’t agree with what Mother has done.

401
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:22,742
I venture to say that

402
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:24,285
both of our mothers

403
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:27,085
planned for us after all.

404
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,428
They loved us in a wrong way.

405
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:32,342
I think you also have fully the same feeling.

406
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:33,542
I’m not interested in

407
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,457
the way of the heaven emperor
paved by Mother at all.

408
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:39,885
You’re better and more reliable than me.

409
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,742
I’ll follow you

410
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:44,400
and submit myself to your rule in the future.

411
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,400
I hope

412
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:48,857
you can forgive Mother.

413
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:50,400
Xu Feng,

414
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:53,028
I appreciate

415
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:55,371
what you said,

416
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:57,485
but

417
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:00,342
you’re not here

418
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,914
only for this matter, right?

419
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:06,400
Can you do me a favor?

420
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:08,000
Jin Mi?

421
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:20,000
You seem to like

422
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:22,171
my fiancée very much.

423
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:27,542
I hope you can call off
the engagement with Jin Mi.

424
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,600
I won’t compete with you

425
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,028
for the authority of the Heaven Realm,

426
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,914
and I’ll also make up for Mother’s errors.

427
00:25:33,485 --> 00:25:36,457
I only hope you can give up Jin Mi.

428
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,342
The marriage between Jin Mi and me

429
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,371
was arranged by Father and Water Immortal.

430
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,028
I have no right to give it up,

431
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:49,885
and,

432
00:25:51,028 --> 00:25:52,342
the authority of the Heaven Realm

433
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:55,085
is always mastered by Father and Mother.

434
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:57,257
You can’t determine it,

435
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,571
whether you’re willing or not.

436
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,171
Do you know?

437
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,457
Jin Mi and I love each other.

438
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:08,457
You won’t be happy if you’re together.

439
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:41,885
Give me,

440
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:43,542
or grab from me.

441
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,267
I always live on the alms

442
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:48,228
given by Mother and you.

443
00:26:48,971 --> 00:26:51,142
You always determine what to give me

444
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:53,314
or what to grab from me,

445
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,428
and then I must accept it.

446
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,600
From now on,

447
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,142
I’ll be the dominator of my fate.

448
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:04,171
From now on,

449
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:07,885
I’ll make a decision freely.

450
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:09,542
I won’t absolutely

451
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:12,285
give up Jin Mi.

452
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,628
This is Daddy’s gift,

453
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:26,628
and this is Auntie Lin Xiu’s.

454
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:34,514
Do I need to present something to Phoenix?

455
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:37,142
After all, he was willing

456
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:39,085
to die for me.

457
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:41,885
What should I present to him?

458
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:45,485
I have an idea.

459
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:58,171
Phoenix, I’ll present you
one petal of my real body,

460
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,628
which can show you the spring flowers
and autumn fruits for a moment.

461
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,371
Auntie Lin Xiu, here you are.

462
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,123
This is Ganoderma Nourishing Skin Ointment,

463
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,624
which can nourish and moisten your skin.

464
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:41,314
You must consume much energy while working.

465
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:43,942
You can firm your essence
and strengthen your vigor after eating it.

466
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:46,114
Thank you, Mi.

467
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:48,228
What’s wrong with you?

468
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:51,200
You hurt your primordial spirit in the practice?

469
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:52,628
It’s not serious.

470
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,400
Daddy should be to blame for it.

471
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,714
He always urges me to practice

472
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:57,200
after I return from the mortal world.

473
00:28:58,114 --> 00:28:59,314
Well,

474
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:00,228
this is yours.

475
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:01,371
Are you happy?

476
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:04,441
This is Ginseng Fleece-flower Root Ointment,

477
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:07,371
which can blacken hair, prolong life,
enrich and benefit essence and blood.

478
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,685
It’s suitable for you.

479
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,800
After you return,

480
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:13,314
when did I urge you to practice?

481
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,485
All these are prepared by you?

482
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:19,657
Good.

483
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,742
You know how to care about others.

484
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,342
You finally grow up after
experiencing hardships in the mortal world.

485
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:32,742
In fact, I gained a lot

486
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,142
after returning from the mortal world.

487
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:38,285
I experienced parting forever,

488
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:40,857
sought but failed, loved but parted,

489
00:29:41,142 --> 00:29:42,435
witnessed the life and death

490
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:43,970
and was disillusioned with the mortal world.

491
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,400
I seem

492
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,942
to know many things overnight.

493
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:50,000
What did you learn?

494
00:29:51,028 --> 00:29:52,114
Nothing special.

495
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,971
Have some tea, Daddy.

496
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:00,114
Good girl.

497
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,228
Auntie Lin Xiu,

498
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:05,085
recently,

499
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:08,171
I heard from some talkative fairies that

500
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,085
Fairy Wen Yue wanted to
get back her marriage contract

501
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:12,228
from Immortal Meng Zhang.

502
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:13,257
Is it true?

503
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,028
I didn’t hear of it.

504
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:16,635
They have been engaged with each other.

505
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,386
It’s impossible to get back the marriage contract.

506
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,571
Daddy,

507
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,371
in the Heaven Realm,

508
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:28,800
can we get back

509
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,714
the established marriage contract?

510
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:34,800
You want to call off
the engagement with Night Immortal?

511
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,857
Fish Fairy’s mom is just dead.

512
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,314
I can’t propose it now,

513
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:44,685
but…

514
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:45,771
Let’s go to

515
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:49,942
visit your mom later.

516
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,657
In front of your mom’s memorial tablet,

517
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,142
tell me the truth.

518
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,400
Did you refuse the appointment of Floral Immortal

519
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:18,690
for Fire Immortal?

520
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:22,628
Yes, Daddy.

521
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,028
I’ve promised

522
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,771
to be with him.

523
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:31,257
I know

524
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,657
there was an unforgettable love
between Xu Feng and you

525
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:36,971
when experiencing hardships in the mortal world,

526
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:39,657
but it’s just an insignificant memory

527
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,685
in your life.

528
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:44,057
No, Daddy.

529
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:46,057
Although my lifetime in the mortal world

530
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,771
seems to be very short

531
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,485
in the Heaven Realm,

532
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,314
but I bear it in mind.

533
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,028
In the mortal world,

534
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:55,885
I didn’t regret to be buried with Xu Feng,

535
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:59,142
so did he.

536
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,371
I think it’s love.

537
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:04,114
The love between my mom and you

538
00:32:04,114 --> 00:32:05,542
was also the same.

539
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,400
For the sake of her,

540
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,628
you were also willing to give up everything.

541
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:09,828
It’s easy to be in love,

542
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,685
but this case is not as simple as you think.

543
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:13,600
Her Majesty,

544
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:17,714
she is merciless.

545
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,857
In the mortal world,

546
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:21,485
I witnessed she killed Night Immortal’s mom.

547
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:23,828
She’s so cruel.

548
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:26,114
If you’re with Xu Feng,

549
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,542
you’ll suffer.

550
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:29,085
Daddy,

551
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:30,800
I know,

552
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:33,942
but I’ll face such problems sooner or later.

553
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:35,885
Now that I’ve decided,

554
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,171
I won’t avoid them.

555
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,971
I don’t want you
to follow in your mom’s footsteps.

556
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:44,800
Daddy,

557
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,771
those are the past things.

558
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:51,085
They won’t

559
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:53,257
happen again.

560
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:55,542
As an immortal,

561
00:32:56,114 --> 00:32:58,342
if I can’t protect

562
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:03,142
and be with the one I want,

563
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:04,285
my life will be meaningless.

564
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:07,028
I’d rather be a mortal in the mortal world.

565
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:08,971
Although my life won’t be long,

566
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:11,428
I can live heartily

567
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:13,028
and happily.

568
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:14,457
Not everything

569
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,742
can be solved with enthusiasm.

570
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:18,400
But how can we solve problems

571
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
without enthusiasm?

572
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:21,828
It still needs to be thought deeply.

573
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:24,228
Before having a solution,

574
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:28,171
you can’t be impetuous.

575
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,628
I see, Daddy.

576
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:39,200
Help me.

577
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:48,685
Your Highness.

578
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,114
Mu Ci.

579
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,942
Help me.

580
00:33:58,171 --> 00:33:58,914
Your Highness.

581
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,171
Have you fed the medicine
given by the demon doctor to him?

582
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:03,200
Your Highness,

583
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,857
we have fed the medicine to him
according to the demon doctor’s instructions.

584
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:06,057
But it doesn’t help at all.

585
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,057
Why?

586
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:09,371
Give me. Give me.

587
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,000
OK, I’ll give you the medicine.

588
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,314
I’ll bring it here.

589
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:14,404
Is there any other medicine?

590
00:34:14,404 --> 00:34:14,863
Bring me all the medicine.

591
00:34:15,028 --> 00:34:15,657
Bring it here.

592
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,828
Wild Silkworms.

593
00:34:27,828 --> 00:34:29,885
What’s it?

594
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:30,742
Your Majesty.

595
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:31,885
Your Majesty, forgive me.

596
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:33,542
I’m wrong.

597
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,971
It seems that

598
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:48,628
Mi really falls in love with Fire Immortal.

599
00:34:49,657 --> 00:34:50,742
She’s not serious.

600
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:52,800
She liked Night Immortal before.

601
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
She grew up after this experience

602
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,200
but she also changed her mind.

603
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:59,657
Maybe she’ll change
her mind again in the future.

604
00:35:02,114 --> 00:35:03,657
We must stop her from acting recklessly

605
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,542
for the time being.

606
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,285
I think Mi is serious this time.

607
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:12,114
You also hope

608
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,114
she can marry the one she loves.

609
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:18,228
You worry about Her Majesty?

610
00:35:18,514 --> 00:35:20,457
Although Fire Immortal
is different from Her Majesty,

611
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,600
after all,

612
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:26,000
she is his mother.

613
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,371
Her Majesty won’t live with Mi in peace.

614
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,771
If she wants to hurt Jin Mi in the future,

615
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:35,885
what will Fire Immortal do?

616
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:37,714
I worry

617
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,771
Mi can’t deal with her relationships
with Fire Immortal and Night Immortal.

618
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,371
Both of them are unyielding,

619
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:49,200
so they won’t give up Mi easily.

620
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:49,942
They behave like

621
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,714
young Heavenly Emperor.

622
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:55,257
Zi Fen suffered a lot because of His Majesty.

623
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,771
I absolutely won’t

624
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,400
let Jin Mi follow in her mother’s footsteps.

625
00:36:00,857 --> 00:36:02,285
After this experience,

626
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,571
I think Fire Immortal deeply loves Mi.

627
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,400
He is different from his dad.

628
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,485
His Majesty also deeply loved Zi Fen,

629
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,085
but it was just obsession,

630
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:15,142
which could kill others.

631
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,657
His Majesty couldn’t be with Zi Fen,

632
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:20,171
so he hurt so many people,

633
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:21,485
but even if he was with Zi Fen,

634
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,171
the world couldn’t be peaceful, either.

635
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:32,773
"Qizheng Hall"

636
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,170
According to Her Majesty’s instructions,

637
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:35,657
when you’re in mourning,

638
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,166
you can stay in Xuanji Palace

639
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:40,057
and don’t need to go out
to be on night duty for star arrangement.

640
00:36:41,942 --> 00:36:42,971
Yes.

641
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,800
Her Majesty shows solicitude for you,

642
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,600
so we’re specially ordered

643
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,714
to send you two kinds of
different mourning dresses

644
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:48,742
for selection.

645
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:52,971
Put them down.

646
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:54,571
Her Majesty said

647
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:55,771
you can decide

648
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,514
to choose the one of Heaven Realm
or that of Arowana Family,

649
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:00,742
and then we need to take the other one back.
