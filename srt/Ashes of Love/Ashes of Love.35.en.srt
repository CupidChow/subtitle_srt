1
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,540
"Episode 35"

3
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
I’m reasonable.

4
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,920
Two choices.

5
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,040
Make a clean break
with these remnants of Dongting,

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,160
and execute the punishment personally,

7
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,340
Or take the blame for the remnants

8
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,100
and to atone for your mom.

9
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,500
I,

10
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
I am wrong.

11
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,680
I would like to save him with my life.

12
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,700
Run Yu.

13
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,880
OK.

14
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,700
You’re sensible.

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,740
I can’t betray
my birth mother and her family again.

16
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,800
I’ll take all the blame.

17
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,960
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

18
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,920
punish him with your Shocking Heavenly Thunder,

19
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Lightning Light,

20
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,100
and my Lotus Fire of Retribution.

21
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,700
Even Qiong Qi couldn’t bear such a punishment.

22
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,860
I wonder whether you can stand

23
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,260
the cruel punishment for 30,000 times.

24
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,740
Please punish me.

25
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,480
OK.

26
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,140
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

27
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,800
carry out the punishment.

28
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,580
Your Majesty,

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,160
here is the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

30
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,000
Moreover, the first Prince
is the son of His Majesty.

31
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,440
Carry out the punishment.

32
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,360
Brother.

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Originally I thought he was rational

34
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,400
and different from Xu Feng.

35
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,920
Unexpectedly, he can hardly retain his composure.

36
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,540
The hands and feet are broken into pieces.

37
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,600
The body is like broken jade.

38
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,260
The fierce fire of retribution is burning.

39
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
The sea of blood is surging.

40
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,700
The dim nether world is crying.

41
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,860
Countless bones are empty.

42
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,960
Mom.

43
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,180
I heard of that.

44
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,460
I bow and call Bhagawan.

45
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Don’t get slack.

46
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,540
Run Yu.

47
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,720
Brother. Brother.

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,260
Run Yu.

49
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,820
-Wake up.
-Run Yu, wake up.

50
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,840
Wake up, Brother.

51
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,980
Wake up.

52
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Heavenly Empress,

53
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
you are a demon.

54
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,460
I’m the one who killed your son.

55
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Punish me.

56
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,740
She even cares nothing.

57
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,860
Brother.

58
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,840
Your Majesty,

59
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,020
there isn’t Glazed Pure Fire
in the Punishment of Thunder and Light.

60
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,940
If Glazed Pure Fire is used,

61
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,320
Night Immortal will certainly die.

62
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,460
Please don’t.

63
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,460
How about saving it for you?

64
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,940
What crime did Night Immortal commit?

65
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,740
Why did you even want to
kill him with illegal punishment?

66
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,500
Water Immortal,

67
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,380
although you shielded the criminal,

68
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,780
I forgave you

69
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,440
with great generosity.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Don’t push your luck.

71
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,440
However, you plot to murder
the son of His Majesty.

72
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,240
Run Yu disobeyed orders first

73
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,080
and then took the punishment
for 30,000 remnants.

74
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,340
It has nothing to do with me.

75
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,560
Just stop.

76
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,640
Your Majesty.

77
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,500
Your Majesty.

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,740
Here,

79
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,280
deliver an imperial order
at the Southern Heavenly Gate.

80
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,860
The heinous chief criminal Su Li

81
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
was executed before.

82
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,980
Water Family in Dongting
who have been deceived and forced by her

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,140
are forgivable.

84
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,720
Given that it is your first offence,

85
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,460
I offer you a general pardon.

86
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
I hope that you
can thoroughly reform yourselves

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,300
and be loyal to the Heaven Realm.

88
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,900
If you commit further crimes in the future,

89
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,080
you’ll be severely punished.

90
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,840
Yes.

91
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,420
You’re acting a good person.

92
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,220
Night Immortal.

93
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,920
On behalf of the 36,400 lives in Dongting,

94
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,260
I’d like to extend gratitude

95
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,040
to Your Majesty.

96
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,080
Please order to release them, Mother.

97
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,840
Heavenly Empress,

98
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,740
deal with the rest problems.

99
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,540
30,000 times of heavenly punishment
are much more painful than slow slicing,

100
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
not to mention healing wounds.

101
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,540
If I were you,

102
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,660
I would rather destroy the Internal Dan of myself,

103
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,360
so all trouble would come to an end.

104
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,220
Please don’t worry.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,620
I won’t die.

106
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I’ll live well

107
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,640
to witness personally

108
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,560
that you fulfill your  promise

109
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,740
of releasing all of them

110
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,980
and won’t go back on your word.

111
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,100
Brother.

112
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,800
Your Highness

113
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,680
Run Yu.

114
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,380
He is dying.

115
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,300
Mom,

116
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,540
I feel very cold.

117
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,060
I feel very cold.

118
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,280
Your Highness.

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,160
Brother Run Yu.

120
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,360
Mom.

121
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,020
Mom.

122
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,100
Mom.

123
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,840
Mom.

124
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,740
Mom.

125
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,000
It’s so hot.

126
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,340
It’s so hot.

127
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,340
Once His Highness said

128
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,220
if someone is extremely cold
due to losing a lot of blood,

129
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,280
there will be a feeling of burning viscera instead.

130
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,880
Mom.

131
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,260
Your Majesty,

132
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,340
you agreed to let me handle
this matter with full authority,

133
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,520
but at the last moment,
you became soft-hearted.

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,460
You acted a good person

135
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,020
and I was the bad one.

136
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,620
If it goes on like this

137
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,260
and arouses heavenly wrath,
immortal resentment and popular criticisms,

138
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,000
what’s good for you and me?

139
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,240
It’s your fault.

140
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,600
You indulged him so much

141
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,000
that at last he shifted the blame.

142
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
He would rather accept

143
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,420
his heinous birth mother than me.

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,860
After the battle in Dongting,

145
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,680
he even wanted to protect the remnants.

146
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,860
If it keeps going on,

147
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,240
I’m afraid the Heaven Realm
will be overturned by him.

148
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,260
It won’t happen as I’m here.

149
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,260
Xu Feng and Run Yu are different.

150
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,480
I know well

151
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,560
who is more important.

152
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,860
I’ll keep what you said in my mind

153
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,180
and hope that you will never forget it.

154
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,620
Your Highness,

155
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
finally you’re awake.

156
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,640
Has Her Majesty released them?

157
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,300
Don’t you care about your life at all?

158
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,520
I promised my mom

159
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,260
to take good care of Li.

160
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,600
There are thousands of Li in the Dongting Lake.

161
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,340
Once Li of the Lize Pond

162
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,240
suffered the pain of depending on others.

163
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,580
I don’t want them to suffer the same pain.

164
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,040
The Water Family in Dongting is lucky that

165
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,500
you can consider them in your own place.

166
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,520
Mister Immortal.

167
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,620
You’re badly hurt.

168
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,280
Lie down.

169
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,100
Mister Immortal,

170
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,380
I have an unreasonable demand.

171
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,840
I’m too weak

172
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,340
to compete with Her Majesty.

173
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,220
Please take care of

174
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,800
those homeless members in Water Family

175
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,000
in Dongting.

176
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,580
Don’t worry.

177
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,780
I’ll try my best.

178
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,820
After that day in the Dongting Lake,

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,720
I’ve decided to fight against her to the end.

180
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,080
Thank you.

181
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,680
Kuang Lu,

182
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,420
Mister Immortal,

183
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,620
do not tell anyone that

184
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,840
I was hurt,

185
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,400
especially Mi.

186
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,740
I don’t want her to worry about me

187
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,000
and don’t want her

188
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,260
to see

189
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,960
my disgrace.

190
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,740
Promise me.

191
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,780
Don’t be sad for me.

192
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,380
Rou Rou.

193
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,760
Rou Rou.

194
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,880
Rou Rou.

195
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,580
Rou Rou.

196
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
I’ll find the murderer

197
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,600
and avenge your death.

198
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,100
Choose a lucky day three months later

199
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,140
to hold the wedding ceremony
for Jin Mi and Run Yu.

200
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,940
"Xuanji Palace"

201
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,820
Temper your mind body in hardships,

202
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,280
and stick to overcome difficulties.

203
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,120
I’ve told it to you many times

204
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,860
but you can’t do it.

205
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,540
Now you and the Heavenly Empress
are incompatible,

206
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,320
which makes me very embarrassed.

207
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,060
She did overdo it,

208
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,060
but she did that under my order.

209
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,840
Going against her is against me.

210
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,060
You should learn a lesson
from what happened

211
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,600
in the Empyrean Cloud Palace.

212
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,200
I know I was wrong.

213
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,800
I’ve pardoned the Water Family in Dongting.

214
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,080
Today’s matter concerns
the reputation of the Heaven Realm.

215
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,540
The matter that you were punished
by the Heavenly Thunder and Lightning Fire

216
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,200
for remnants of Dongting

217
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,380
can’t be mentioned again, you know?

218
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,540
Yes.

219
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,860
OK.

220
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,080
Make a promise of an immortal.

221
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,880
I promise

222
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,540
as long as Father and Mother
don’t mention this matter

223
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,540
and let it go,

224
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,440
it’ll be the past.

225
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,360
I won’t mention it again.

226
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,660
Father,

227
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,380
is my mom

228
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,180
really so wicked?

229
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,520
As the matter has been settled,

230
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,720
there is no need to reconsider it.

231
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,520
As an immortal,

232
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,180
you shouldn’t be stopped
by other matters or confused in love.

233
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,020
You still have to further train your power.

234
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,780
Don’t worry.

235
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,060
The matter of your birth mother
is none of your business.

236
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,900
However, I didn’t expect that

237
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,080
you dare to go against
the Heavenly Empress one day.

238
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,960
I know I was wrong.

239
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,080
Under the critical circumstance,
I had no time to think more about it.

240
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,640
The reason why I didn’t
come immediately just now

241
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,700
was that I wanted to test you.

242
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,800
Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.

243
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,340
You’re supposed to resist against

244
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
the Heavenly Empress
and the Bird Family afterwards.

245
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,480
Father,

246
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,960
if I didn’t stand out back then,

247
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,020
would you just ignore lives

248
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,520
of the Water Family in Dongting?

249
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,940
You’re still young.

250
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,480
After living for another
tens of thousands of years,

251
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
you’ll know that

252
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,359
those with a hundred years of life,
or a thousand years of cultivation

253
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,240
are the same as ephemera

254
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,780
to our immortals.

255
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,060
Such a short moment is meaningless.

256
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,800
Nothing will be changed

257
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,740
without them in the world.

258
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,020
That is, the natural law is merciless.

259
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,240
In the tens of millions of years,

260
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,100
as an immortal,

261
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,740
have you ever been

262
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,100
moved with compassion?

263
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,840
I’m not afraid to tell you the truth.

264
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,420
I am

265
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
the biggest prisoner

266
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,480
in heaven and earth.

267
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,080
It turns out...

268
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,800
It turns out that my birth

269
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,800
is completely a conspiracy.

270
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,200
Mom.

271
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,140
Mom, I’m the one who killed you.

272
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
I’m guilty.

273
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,440
I’m guilty.

274
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:34,920
No.

275
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,980
It’s him.

276
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,500
He is

277
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,640
the chief criminal

278
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,720
of everything in the world.

279
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,180
In your heart,

280
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,420
you don’t care about your sons, your wife

281
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,440
or the family.

282
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,140
In you heart,

283
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,860
you can control all people.

284
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,160
The natural law is merciless.

285
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,780
Father,

286
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,940
I’ve learned it.

287
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,760
I must live on.

288
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,300
What doesn’t kill me,

289
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,880
make me stronger.

290
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,360
Where is Mi?

291
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,920
She was thinking about Rou Rou just now.

292
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,020
She should have fallen asleep now.

293
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
How is Night Immortal?

294
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,220
New hatred is piled on old
and the disaster continues.

295
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,120
He is filled with grievances,
but he can complain to nowhere.

296
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,320
It seems that it’ll be difficult to dissolve

297
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,700
the resentment between him and Her Majesty.

298
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,620
Though today’s matter
has been covered by His Majesty,

299
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,940
it has spread secretly
in the Heavenly Realm.

300
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,260
What Her Majesty did
has caused public outrage.

301
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,400
Instead, Night Immortal
has won more people’s support

302
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,360
with his firm character
behind a gentle appearance.

303
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,600
In the past I thought
that he was gentle in nature.

304
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,960
I didn’t expect that
he isn’t afraid of strong enemies

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,280
and would rather die for a just cause.

306
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,120
He can bear what is unbearable to others.

307
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,820
Ordinary one won’t be

308
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
so tolerant and brave.

309
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,200
Her Majesty failed to show her restraint.

310
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,960
A thing turns into its opposite
if pushed too far.

311
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,460
Things will change.

312
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,680
Just wait and see.

313
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,320
Chief Magnolia,

314
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,800
what are you doing?

315
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,340
What happened?

316
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,400
Sister,

317
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,920
I was wrong.

318
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,460
I committed a great crime.

319
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,380
That day someone of the
Water Family in Dongting came to you

320
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,240
to form an alliance with Floral Realm
to fight against Heaven Realm.

321
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,120
I was so lost and confused

322
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,900
that I believed in what he said

323
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,440
and told him

324
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,800
the birth of Jin Mi.

325
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,160
What?

326
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,260
Magnolia,

327
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,380
you were so foolish.

328
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,084
I think it was my fault
for telling others about her birth,

329
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,980
so she was almost killed

330
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,088
by others with the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow

331
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,900
when she experienced hardships.

332
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,100
It’s all my fault.

333
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,820
I know that I am too sinful

334
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,682
to beg for your pardon.

335
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:52,180
I just want to die

336
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,220
to show respect to the spirit of the late lord.

337
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,160
If you die in this way,

338
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,220
how could you face her?

339
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,980
But if I live in this way,

340
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,180
how could I face others?

341
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,780
All right.

342
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,960
I know your mind.

343
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,240
You made the mistake
just because you wanted to

344
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
revenge the late lord’s death.

345
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,360
However,

346
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,180
she didn’t allow us to revenge,

347
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,320
because she was afraid that
there is never an end of taking revenge.

348
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,040
She had returned to heaven and earth,

349
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,760
and what she cared most was only Jin Mi.

350
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,800
Since that you show true repentance,

351
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,040
do not mention this matter again.

352
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,880
I’ll pretend that it hasn't happened.

353
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,200
Yes.

354
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,700
Promise me.

355
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,580
From now on, we would abide
by the teachings of the late lord

356
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,560
to safeguard Jin Mi

357
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,180
with one mind.

358
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:55,940
Yes,

359
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,280
Sister.

360
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,620
Fairy Jin Mi.

361
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,320
I should call you Immortal Jin Mi now.

362
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,740
It doesn’t matter.

363
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,400
Do you come to see His Highness?

364
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,880
You have no idea of it.

365
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,931
His birth mother
who he just met for a short time

366
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,475
was executed on the spot by Her Majesty

367
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,460
on the grounds of rebellion.

368
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,820
She was executed?

369
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,820
After his birth mother died,

370
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,460
His Highness doesn’t sleep or eat.

371
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,740
Would you please try to persuade him?

372
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,920
He has always listened to you.

373
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,700
OK.

374
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,040
Immortal.

375
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,800
Mi.

376
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,060
I just heard that your birth mother died.

377
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,660
I don’t know the ins and outs.

378
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,400
However, you are so kind,

379
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,640
so your birth mother

380
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,260
must be gentle and kind too.

381
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,320
I just recalled my childhood,

382
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,440
just knew who was my birth mother

383
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,540
and just met her,

384
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,100
but I watched her

385
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,000
dying before me

386
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,380
helplessly.

387
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,820
Not long ago,

388
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,120
I watched Rou Rou

389
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,625
perished her primordial spirit to save me.

390
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,160
I was helplessly too.

391
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,300
so I can understand your mood.

392
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,500
Before Rou Rou died,

393
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,020
she told me to let it go.

394
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,420
As a saying in the mortal world goes,

395
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,520
the deceased now has rested in peace,
while the alive must keep living on.

396
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,540
Your mom

397
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,880
must hate seeing you like this now

398
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,060
and hate seeing that you don’t sleep or eat

399
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,580
and you’re so miserable.

400
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,640
The deceased now has rested in peace,
while the alive must keep living on.

401
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,300
Yes.

402
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,940
I think

403
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,640
they loved us so much

404
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,200
that they didn’t want us to be sorrowful.

405
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,300
Love?

406
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,480
Mi,

407
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,820
you seem to be

408
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,780
a little different from the past.

409
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,260
What is the difference?

410
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,980
Kuang Lu said

411
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,820
our wedding date has been set by Father.

412
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,500
What’s your opinion?

413
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,500
What’s your opinion?

414
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,660
I think if I refuse now,

415
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
he will be sadder.

416
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,540
When she was alive,

417
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,920
I couldn’t take care of her.

418
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,600
Now she is gone.

419
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,660
I want to apply to Father

420
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,440
for observing mourning for her for 3 years.

421
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,560
Mi,

422
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,660
you’re the most important person

423
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,980
to me now.

424
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,040
Will you wait for me?

425
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,180
I...

426
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,220
Stay with me for a while, OK?

427
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,720
As long as you’re by my side,

428
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,940
I won’t be so spiteful

429
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,980
and so painful.

430
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,680
Jin Mi,

431
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,040
I miss you so much.

432
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,460
Jin Mi,

433
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,180
let me have a look.

434
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,760
Have you changed
after being promoted to be an immortal?

435
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,200
It seems that there is nothing different.

436
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,960
On the contrary, I think

437
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,540
all is different.

438
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,820
Chief Peony,

439
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,960
Chief Begonia.

440
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,080
Luckily, Jin Mi comes back safely,

441
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,600
or I’ll be really unforgivable

442
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,680
and feel guilty for the late lord.

443
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,400
It’s all because of my carelessness

444
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,120
that you even had to worry about her.

445
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,080
No one expected that there were

446
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,840
so many twists and turns in just a few days.

447
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,340
No wonder that the Heaven Realm
didn’t allow us to interfere in it.

448
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,280
Unexpectedly, behind it was a hidden trap.

449
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,480
It was really unbearable
to our Floral Realm this time.

450
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,020
That’s just what I think.

451
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,360
But don’t forget

452
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,680
what Zi Fen told you.

453
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,080
We have to give the matter further thought.

454
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,380
The Floral Realm shouldn’t get involved.

455
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,160
Without the reveal of the late lord,

456
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,440
we won’t be who we are now.

457
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,120
Though the late lord
asked repeatedly not to seek revenge,

458
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
bulling Jin Mi

459
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,020
is insulting the Floral Realm,

460
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,680
so I can’t remain indifferent.

461
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,000
Thank all of you

462
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,320
for your kindness.

463
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,040
However, as Mi has experienced hardships,

464
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
she needs a good rest to readjust her mood.

465
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,620
I also need to think about this matter.

466
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,080
You’ve suffered a lot, Jin Mi.

467
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,460
I didn’t lead a tough life in the mortal world,

468
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,580
because Rou Rou was with me,

469
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,640
but...

470
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,540
Rou Rou?

471
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
Where is she?

472
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,760
Has she come alive?

473
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,380
She,

474
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,580
she came alive originally,

475
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,440
but she died later.

476
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,520
That’s her destiny.

477
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,840
Don’t blame yourself.

478
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,940
She got a life

479
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,560
in the mortal world
just because of your obsession.

480
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,420
I think Jin Mi has made some progress

481
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,660
after coming back.

482
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,620
She even refused to be Floral Immortal,

483
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,000
which was really a surprise to us.

484
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,700
I thought it was troublesome
when I learned that

485
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,060
I had to handle matters in the Floral Realm.

486
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,020
I think she’s right.

487
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,720
If she is Floral Immortal,

488
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,720
the Floral Realm will be in a mess.

489
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,280
Daddy.

490
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,320
Even an immortal has merits and faults.

491
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,560
I must be the best in
having fun and eating in the Floral Realm.

492
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,940
However, all matters of Floral Realm

493
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,900
should be in the charge of Chief Peony.

494
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,120
Only when you take charge,

495
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
we’ll feel assured.

496
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,840
Mi is becoming more and more sensible.

497
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,800
OK. Let’s come inside.

498
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,140
Please, Water Immortal.

499
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,360
Go, please.

500
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,194
"Zifangyun Palace"

501
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
In the mortal world,

502
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,620
I even killed

503
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,020
my natural father personally for Xu Feng.

504
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,800
However,

505
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,960
he didn’t change his mind at all.

506
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,120
Auntie,

507
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,040
I really don’t know what to do.

508
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,900
It seems that after
what happened in the mortal world,

509
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,220
Xu Feng is increasingly obsessed with Jin Mi.

510
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,700
Auntie,

511
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,640
what should I do?

512
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,420
Calm down.

513
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,900
Let me think about it.

514
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,260
Go back

515
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,780
to have a good rest.

516
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
Wait for my message, OK?

517
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,000
Yes.

518
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,060
Jin Mi.

519
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,420
Your Majesty,

520
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,841
time flies.

521
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,468
You have been gone for two years.

522
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,340
I wonder if you have been
reincarnated in a new body

523
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,180
and come back to the mortal world.

524
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,040
If there is a chance,

525
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,940
how I wish I can work with you

526
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,580
for another life.

527
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
Lord Liaoyuan,

528
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,860
you’re so loyal to Xu Feng.

529
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,600
You really don’t let me down.

530
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,660
Young man,

531
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,140
where are you from?

532
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,460
Young man?

533
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,460
After living for so many years,

534
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,280
I’m stilled called young man.

535
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,380
How shameful!

536
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,740
Are you a human being or a ghost?

537
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,420
I’m neither a human

538
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,000
nor a ghost.

539
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,600
I’m an immortal.

540
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,820
The way you play chess

541
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,760
has never been seen before
and never will again.

542
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,180
Are you praising me?

543
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,520
Confidence is absolutely one of your merits.

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,900
Is there anything you want to say to me?

545
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,060
Daddy,

546
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,080
if,

547
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,680
if I tell you now

548
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,580
I don’t want to get married,

549
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,640
what will you do?

550
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,060
Why?

551
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,720
I used to think that
it was appropriate to marry Night Immortal,

552
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,740
but now...

553
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,600
What do you think is inappropriate now?

554
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,640
After going to the mortal world,

555
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,300
I think...

556
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,520
After you went to the mortal world,

557
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,120
what happened between
Fire Immortal and you

558
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,020
was just like a dream.

559
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,540
Don’t mix

560
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,560
the mortal Jin Mi

561
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,320
with the Immortals Jin Mi.

562
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,620
Think over it carefully
before making a decision.

563
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,080
Don’t make the wrong decision for the future

564
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,560
as what you did in playing chess.

565
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,280
Well,

566
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,320
Lord Liaoyuan,

567
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,620
be sure

568
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,120
not to tell Xu Feng that

569
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,680
I pushed you to the mortal world.

570
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,960
Xu Feng,

571
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,820
Lord Liaoyuan comes back with me.

572
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,120
Your Highness.

573
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,460
You went to the mortal world with me

574
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,320
to guard me.

575
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,220
Thank you very much.

576
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,240
That’s my responsibility.

577
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,120
Only you could think of

578
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,860
jumping into the Cause and Effect Plate

579
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,700
to be a mortal with me in the mortal world.

580
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,940
However, if you were an immortal,

581
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,920
you could protect me better, right?

582
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,940
Oh, why I didn’t think of that?

583
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,140
Well,

584
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,500
I have to do matchmaking
in House of Marriage.

585
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,680
I’m leaving.

586
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,480
Lord Liaoyuan,

587
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,600
as Xu Feng is grounded for several days,

588
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,680
take good care of him.

589
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,440
Where are the Phoenix Lanterns
in mortal world now?

590
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,946
They are collected in the Imperial Mausoleum.

591
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,700
Help me to take them back

592
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,000
and put by the side of the Liuzi Pond.

593
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,720
Yes.

594
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,400
Go.

595
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,360
Your Highness.

596
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,740
Why isn’t there
the one that I made with Jin Mi?

597
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,000
Qin Tong knew that

598
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,420
King Yi loved it most,

599
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,560
so he put it in the coffin

600
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,320
of Jin Mi and King Yi.

601
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,300
I forgot it.

602
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,920
Qin Tong in the mortal world was quite smart.

603
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,480
Why are you a bit stupid

604
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,000
after coming back to the Heaven Realm?

605
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,540
I’ll go and fetch it now.

606
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,340
Mr. Hu.

607
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,140
Look.

608
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,480
Great. Finally, you get one.

609
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,940
Mr. Hu,

610
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,580
after being an immortal,

611
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,780
Jin Mi is different.

612
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,840
She liked small toys very much before,

613
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,160
but now she loses her interest soon

614
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,740
after playing this slingshot for a while.

615
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,020
Will it be boring

616
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,340
after someone is promoted to an immortal?

617
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,060
In my opinion,

618
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,340
she is mixing up with sad,

619
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,540
unhappy and happy moods,

620
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,960
so she loses her interest in having fun.

621
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,940
She is sad for Rou Rou’s death,

622
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,300
but why is she unhappy?

623
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,960
After all she has been
promoted as an immortal

624
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,520
and gained much magic power.

625
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,120
I guess

626
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,560
it’s because of Night Immortal.

627
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,120
He is an high-level immortal

628
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,340
while she is an immortal.

629
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,760
At the end, she is

630
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,560
a level lower than her future husband,

631
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,240
which makes her feel inferior unavoidably.

632
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,900
That makes sense.

633
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,180
So she must be happy that

634
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,080
her wedding date

635
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,560
with the first Prince has been set.

636
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,500
Yes.

637
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,760
What’s that invading the Water Mirror?

638
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:52,580
Get it.
