1
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,941
“Ashes of Love”

2
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,090
"Episode 12"

3
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,922
Earth Immortal, how may I help you?

4
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,194
Greetings to Night Immortal.

5
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:26,364
I'm going to report myself
at the mansion of Lord Lao.

6
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:31,452
I've come here to bid farewell to
Your Highness and Mister Ling Guang.

7
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,615
Unfortunately, Lord Fire Immortal and
Mister Ling Guang are not here.

8
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,955
And this fairy is?

9
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,508
The birthday of the Heavenly Empress is coming up.

10
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,427
Every immortal will celebrate the birthday.

11
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,387
If you catch up the Celebration now,

12
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,472
you would probably get a blessing from the Heavenly Empress.

13
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,195
Thank you so much for telling me that! My lord.

14
00:02:56,675 --> 00:03:00,065
I've always heard that Night Immortal
is the kindest in the Heaven realm.

15
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,045
Now I can see that you are just as good as others said.

16
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:04,315
You don't have to thank me.

17
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:06,935
And for the so called goddess....

18
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:10,935
Don't you think the sun is too bright today? It may hurt your eyes.

19
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,215
ohhhhhh

20
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:14,485
Yes, yes, yes! You are right, my lord!

21
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,595
I'm getting old, and my vision gets blurry sometime

22
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:20,035
I didn't see anything at all!

23
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,545
If there's no order to take

24
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,335
I'd better get going now

25
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:24,255
Leave

26
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,935
Good-bye, my lord.

27
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,575
The Fish Fairy, today is the celebration of
Heavenly Empress' birthday

28
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:37,195
Wouldn't you go attend the celebration?

29
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:38,435
No worries, I'm not in a hurry

30
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:41,455
There’s a lot of time before the Celebration starts.

31
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,315
What’s more,

32
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:47,595
there are more than millions gods and fairies
from Heaven to Earth, and from all directions.

33
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:49,795
No one would notice if I was not there.
It's not a big deal for me.

34
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,215
But Phoenix has already visited
the Heavenly Empress in the early morning

35
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,065
Would the Heavenly Empress get angry if you don't go?

36
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,495
Phoenix and I are different for the Heavenly Empress.

37
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:02,755
If I visited her earlier, she would have been upset

38
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:06,135
Why would she be like that?

39
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:10,205
The Heavenly Empress is not my biological mother.

40
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:14,955
Sorry for being so nosy. So...
which goddess is your biological mother?

41
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,295
My biological mother is not a goddess
and has no position in the Heaven Palace.

42
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,375
I heard that she is only a spirit

43
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:21,675
can't be more common.

44
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,935
Though she is just a little spirit, so unnoticeable

45
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:35,675
She still cannot escape her miserable fate
and keep herself from danger. She is dead.

46
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:38,135
I don't have any memory of my childhood,

47
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:40,275
and also don't know who on earth is my biological mother

48
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,135
I just know that after the death of my biological mother

49
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:46,035
I was adopted by Heavenly Empress

50
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:50,855
There used to be time that Heavenly Empress
and I could get along with each other.

51
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:53,755
But, as time goes

52
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,695
Heavenly Empress became more and more worried that

53
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,855
I would compete with Phoenix for the throne

54
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:02,715
That's why Heavenly Empress gradually isolates me

55
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,455
What about you? Who is your parents?

56
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:13,036
Mr. Hu told me, I am a grape vine that empowered by Chief Peony

57
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,151
A grape vine?

58
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,286
But you just make hail happen

59
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:19,930
That’s supposed to be water-related magic

60
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,635
Oh, Phoenix told me that
my body is suitable for being cultivated by water.

61
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:25,647
So, I started learn water-related magic.

62
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,100
Now that I can't make buns with my magic

63
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,042
I will still keep my word. Let's go out to get some buns, Fish Fairy!

64
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:33,084
Let's go!

65
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,635
These are your buns, enjoy the meal!

66
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:44,637
Little two (waiter), a plate of buns please!

67
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:45,972
OK, wait a minute!

68
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:51,295
Little two? What is that?

69
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:54,275
Is there little three, little four, little five?

70
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:57,679
Little three (nickname for the mistress), Can I have the menu please!

71
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:58,817
Little three!

72
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,445
Are you insane! Don't bother us having lunch!

73
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:10,295
What’s wrong with them? Are they afraid that I would cut in line?

74
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:11,595
Fairy Jin Mi,

75
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:16,595
in mortal world, "little three" can't be used casually.

76
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,235
Are you ready to order?

77
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,355
Things are so weird in human world,

78
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,365
why I can call people "little two",
but cannot call them "little three"

79
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:26,595
That is so pedantic.

80
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,275
Fruit pancake?!

81
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:37,396
You guys are so cruel!!

82
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:40,735
Fairy Jin Mi, the "fruit" is not what you thought of.

83
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,455
The "fruit" here just refers to the crust.

84
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,489
Oh, I get it.

85
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,282
it almost freaks me out.

86
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:55,413
So can I have this, and two cups of soymilk?

87
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:56,515
Alright.

88
00:06:56,664 --> 00:07:01,195
Does Fairy Jin Mi know that the breakfast in human world
is very delicious and has many kinds.

89
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,955
It can compete with the breakfast in Heaven.
Sometimes, human breakfast can be better than ours.

90
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,695
I'm ready to try the human delicacy

91
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:09,885
This are your crab buns, enjoy the meal please!

92
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:19,895
Sorry, Fish Fairy

93
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:20,562
Never mind.

94
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,135
Fish Fairy, your magic is awesome.

95
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,035
to be honest

96
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:35,035
I think you should attend the Birthday Celebration
of Heavenly Empress.

97
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:39,295
I know that the relationship between you two are not close

98
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:42,055
but it would get worse, if you don't go

99
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,875
Even though Heavenly Empress maybe upset for your presence,

100
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:49,555
You've tried your best to do what you should do
as the son of Heavenly Empress.

101
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,555
You don't own anyone.

102
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,175
like the relationship between me and Chief Peony

103
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,597
though I'm really afraid of her,

104
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:59,558
it is impossible for me not to attend her Birthday Celebration

105
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:06,375
I agree with you

106
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,575
okay, I will return to Heaven Real after finishing the breakfast.

107
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:16,715
my lord

108
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:18,201
why are you coming here?

109
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:23,935
My lord, you asked me earlier to find a good-looking china
for dews collected at night

110
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:28,075
how do you think about this one?

111
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,495
To be honest, you don't need to show me how good it is

112
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,435
What your father Immortal Tai Si has

113
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,975
is absolutely nice

114
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:52,567
you've already found out who I am

115
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,235
How long do you want to hide your true identity?

116
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:02,845
Well, the dew that is irradiated by the starlight is precious

117
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,715
For the past three years,

118
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:07,285
you have been guarding the sky

119
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,235
and gathering the dew.

120
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,435
It must have taken a lot of effort.

121
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,265
Is it a gift to the empress?

122
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:21,305
Let's go.

123
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:33,045
they are all going to attend the Birthday Celebration.

124
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,895
leave me here alone

125
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,665
it is so boring!

126
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:41,245
I should not let Fish Fairy go to the Celebration

127
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:46,915
who can hang out with me!!!!!

128
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,115
Lord Puchi! I know it's you!

129
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,665
I'm on the way to the Birthday Celebration,
and just got to the 4th layer of the sky

130
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,928
I felt a strong power that dragged me here

131
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:08,264
Tell me when your power starts being so strong

132
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:11,615
Maybe because Phoenix has given me a thousand-year power

133
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:17,795
last night, I was so smart to ask Phoenix to give me a huge red packet

134
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,295
That could be the reason

135
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:21,855
But we haven't met for a half day

136
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,575
why you are so hurry to call me here

137
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:25,197
Is it because you are dying to see me?

138
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:29,795
Not at all. Phoenix and Fish Fairy went to the Birthday Celebration

139
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:32,115
I am so bored for staying here, alone

140
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,955
Since you are here

141
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:36,500
Let's hang out together!

142
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:40,915
Today is a Big day for Heaven Realm!
All gods have to celebrate Heavenly Empress's Birthday.

143
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,035
Don't you want to join the Celebration and have fun?

144
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,775
I do want to go

145
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,615
No no. I can't

146
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,605
I can't go

147
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:53,025
There are so many gods gathering together

148
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,955
If the Chief Peony knows that I were there

149
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,227
She would catch me back home

150
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:01,065
I've heard that Heavenly Empress have prepared

151
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,818
thousands holy peach ( looks like donut peach) to treat the gods

152
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,403
The holy peach is from the holy peach tree

153
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,863
which has grown for thousand years and watered by holy water

154
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:10,215
It gives fruits every three thousand years.

155
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:15,035
it tastes juicy and delicious,
and it is good for empowering your magic

156
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:16,255
Take me there please!

157
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,374
Don't you be afraid of exposing yourself?

158
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,755
there would be so many gods gathering there

159
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:27,115
if i'm lucky enough, I would met Da Luo Jin Xian,

160
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,855
He could save my friend Rou Rou!

161
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:32,435
If I couldn't meet him, I could still
treat myself with the holy peach to empower myself

162
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,575
Lord Puchi, Lord Puchi

163
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:38,275
Take me there, please, please!

164
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:39,435
We are friends!

165
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,563
If you take me there, I will keep away from you and be careful,

166
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:45,045
it you wouldn't take me there

167
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:46,525
Well, I could find a way on my own!

168
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,445
Since we are friends, I can take you there

169
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,005
Do you guys have invitations?

170
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,917
I'm a close friend of the God - Under-the-moon,

171
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,086
let us pass please

172
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:07,545
That's unfortunate.

173
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,923
Today is a big day, it's the birthday of Heavenly Empress.

174
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:13,575
The Northern Heavenly Gate and the Southern Gate
won't open for those who don't have invitations.

175
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:15,344
I am a very close friend of the God -Under...

176
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,095
Come on.

177
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,655
I've never expected that mentioning the title
of the God Under the Moon still wouldn't let us pass...

178
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:26,455
these two heaven Guardians are so strict and stubborn

179
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,235
Wait!

180
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,485
How can you get this?!

181
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:36,975
What?

182
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,855
I've find a pass card, we don't have to
waste our time arguing with those guards. let's go!

183
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:43,215
Excuse me, please

184
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,666
See!

185
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,794
My apology! Please get in!

186
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,485
Wow.

187
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:59,455
I‘ve never thought that the feather can work as a pass card

188
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:03,395
Phoenix is really a bird with so many pass cards

189
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:06,018
It is the treasure of Fire Immortal, of course, it represents power

190
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:08,455
Take care of it, it would help you someday

191
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,533
Why you have to leave so early?

192
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,655
It won't be late if you stay
till the Birthday Celebration ends

193
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,195
I've got the message from fatgher in the early morning,

194
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,915
saying that the lords of the cities
started fighting each other again

195
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,775
I have to leave as soon as I can, to calm down the fight

196
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,535
I just got in and gave birthday wishes to Heavenly Empress

197
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:36,355
It is emergency, if I am not polite enough
according to Heaven manners,

198
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:37,715
please forgive me

199
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:42,155
Okay, take care of yourself, if you need help, just let me know

200
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:46,165
I am still confused about one thing

201
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,642
I hope you could explain to me honestly

202
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:49,268
I will

203
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,625
Don't you love Fairy Jin Mi?

204
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:59,175
Why I heard that Princess Sui He is going to get married with you?

205
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:00,241
I'm not interested in getting married

206
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,855
It maybe just rumors spread by Heavenly Empress

207
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:09,755
Sorry, Brother Feng, I misunderstood you

208
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:12,290
That you just played around and never took Fairy Jin Mi seriously

209
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,124
But,

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,175
Fairy Jin Mi and I

211
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,795
are unable to be together

212
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,720
My beauty, are you alright?

213
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,205
I don't know why

214
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,933
my heart feels so painful

215
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:33,226
Let me see!

216
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:33,852
Stop!

217
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,655
Do you feel better?

218
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,316
I feel much better now

219
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:41,055
I feel the pain this time!

220
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:43,445
Let’s go

221
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,235
It is so spacious

222
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,785
There are so may people here

223
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,515
You’ve lived in the Water Mirror for a long time
and haven't experience so much before

224
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:12,435
Today, I will show you the world!

225
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,155
Sit, sit, take your seat!

226
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,815
So much food!

227
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:19,187
Do you wanna eat this?

228
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,855
-No, I want to eat that one
-okay, I will take this!

229
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,284
Don't be so surprised, you are so inexperience!

230
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,784
This is the Wushan Goddess, Yao Ji

231
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,078
She is chubby in a very sexy way,

232
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,475
but her waist is kinda thick, not my type

233
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,805
This is the Nvying from Xiangshui

234
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,295
People love her weak posture

235
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:53,355
But a goddess who is as weak as Tou Fu is not attractive either

236
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:55,275
It would be better to add some heroic spirit

237
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:00,845
Who is it?

238
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,305
The female hero, Jing Wei, who used to be a bird,

239
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,941
pecking stones to bury the sea,
and force the king of the Dragon to move around

240
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:11,535
But her personality is so strong, no man could bear it

241
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,985
Lord Puchi, you are so knowledgable, why you know everything

242
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:17,495
Have you heard The Beauty Encyclopedia before?

243
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,115
I wrote it!!

244
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:24,761
But there are not so many beauties nowadays

245
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:27,585
Speaking of the ex- god of flower Zi Fen

246
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,985
She is the most beautiful one that no one can compare with

247
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,115
Sad that the beauty always can't live long

248
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:01,815
Lord Lao is here.

249
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:10,195
Who are those two?

250
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:14,375
The man is Water immortal, the woman is Wind immortal

251
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,925
They are unhappy couples

252
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:20,885
They got married for many years,
but still treated each other respectfully as guests

253
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,035
They don't even have a kid till now

254
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:30,715
I feel that Water immortal looks so elegant

255
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,435
Your taste is really good

256
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:36,962
He has been ranked no.1 on the most handsome faces
among whole realms for 10 thousand years

257
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,455
But he's also getting old now

258
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,616
Of course, it also because of the handsome young man like me,

259
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:45,075
So that the rank of Water immortal has been lowered

260
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,115
I don't know why

261
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:50,540
But I feel so calmed and relaxed after I saw Water immortal

262
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:51,583
And he looks so familiar to me

263
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,975
Familiar to you? you'd better be kidding me

264
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:56,675
Water immortal is detached from the outside

265
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,875
And he is indifferent to others

266
00:17:58,181 --> 00:18:00,755
It is possible that looking at him could make you feel calmed and relaxed

267
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,115
But he is not the type of guy who would look familiar to you

268
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,920
Except Floral Realm

269
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:12,771
The birthday celebration of Heavenly Empress
gathers all goddess from Heaven to Earth

270
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:17,435
Does it indicate that Heavenly Empress would
arrange the marriage of Fire Immortal at the Celebration?

271
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:18,611
Hey friends!

272
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,785
So today is the day for the selection for Phoenix's potential wife?

273
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,615
Yeah, you are right!

274
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:34,855
I bet you a holy wine that Jing Wei would win!

275
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:38,775
But I heard that Fire Immortal likes
male fairies rather than female fairies

276
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:41,935
Earlier before, there is a good-looking Page Boy attendant with him

277
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:43,785
Fire Immortal seems to love that young attendant very much

278
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:46,655
Later, the attendant uses some magic to turn himself into a female fairy

279
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,575
So she is abandoned by Fire Immortal

280
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:52,845
Fire Immortal is in high position, which seems to be powerful

281
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:57,075
But he can't make decisions on his own marriage

282
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,075
His marriage is just a power game

283
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:05,195
Heavenly Empress, Heavenly Empress,
Fire Immortal, Night Immortal are coming

284
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:40,755
Happy birthday, Heavenly Empress, wish you live long and prosper!!

285
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,150
Everyone, sit down please!

286
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,175
Thank you all for coming to my birthday celebration!

287
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,795
You guys bring so much fun in the Palace

288
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:56,095
I feel so happy now

289
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:59,775
Alright, let's start the banquet!

290
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,155
You’ve just promised me that

291
00:20:05,255 --> 00:20:08,355
You will never let Lord Puchi get close to Fairy Jin Mi

292
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,355
Now what is this?!

293
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:14,815
My bad, I will try to let him out

294
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,575
Let them be this time. I don't want to make troubles
on the birthday celebration. watch out for these two

295
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,315
Why the bird gets upset again for no reason

296
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:26,255
Has he found out that I tricked him
for one thousand year magic power?

297
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,515
Fish Fairy!

298
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:37,725
Why Fish Fairy becomes weird too

299
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,881
Coming to this Birthday Celebration really makes him feel so bad

300
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,372
Let’s eat something, take this, take this

301
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,355
Lord Liaoyuan

302
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:51,672
send order to General Po Jun,
double the Heaven guardians to guard the Heaven Palace

303
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:52,965
Yes, your honor

304
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,495
Who is this one?

305
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:14,835
He is Rat Fairy

306
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,585
Rat Fairy?!

307
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:21,205
Rat is the scariest thing in the world, I don't like mice

308
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,375
He is not a common rat

309
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:26,135
He’s our boss in the Chinese zodiac

310
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,915
He is really smart and talented. He is a good player of chess

311
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:32,355
When your favourite Water immortal
was detached from the outside world,

312
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:33,605
the Rat Fairy is the only one that
accompanied with the Water immortal to play chess

313
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:34,995
Did he?

314
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,245
So he is a nice guy

315
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:45,895
Run Yu wishes Heavenly Empress

316
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:47,515
live long and prosper

317
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:52,535
Night Immortal has become increasingly frugal recently

318
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:57,515
you come to the banquet only with the wooden hair pin

319
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:01,173
I appreciated your simple personality

320
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,135
But...

321
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:06,935
It looks like something from Floral Realm

322
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,735
Reply to Heavenly Empress

323
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:15,055
It is just a usual hair pin made from a vine

324
00:22:15,255 --> 00:22:16,755
How can such a usual thing

325
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:20,575
get into the eyes of Night Immortal?

326
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:23,505
The vine is a gift from a very special friend of mine

327
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:24,815
It is meaningful to me

328
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:28,445
Jade hairpin, diamond hairpin,

329
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,075
gold hairpin,

330
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:33,055
those are very rare and expensive

331
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:35,535
But for me, they are all worthless compared with this vine hairpin

332
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,315
Today is Heavenly Empress's Birthday Celebration,

333
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:40,355
I think the vine hairpin is a perfect match

334
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:45,595
Exactly, Fish Fairy is really my best friend!

335
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,595
This vine looks interesting

336
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:50,615
Could you tell me who gave you this?

337
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,675
Whether this one attends the banquet today?

338
00:22:56,435 --> 00:23:01,155
Reply to Heavenly Empress, this friend
is neither a god nor a spirit, she is not here today

339
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,295
What a pity!

340
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,995
It must be a very special existence

341
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:09,555
Next time, if there's a banquet

342
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:12,575
Please remember to send him an invitation!

343
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,035
Fish Fairy is so smart!

344
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,915
But Heavenly Empress is so sharp

345
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:23,495
He has never met me before

346
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:26,375
but he could tell my personality only by a grape vine

347
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:27,295
such an accurate comment on my personality

348
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:44,155
Rat! Rat!

349
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:47,335
The Fairy guest, watch your manner!!

350
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:49,995
What are you doing?

351
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,345
This is The Empyrean Heaven! it is impossible to find a rat here!

352
00:23:55,135 --> 00:24:00,770
Hahhah, sorry that my little friend scared you guys!
It is totally my fault!

353
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,875
You, such a naughty thing!

354
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:11,822
Who are you?

355
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:15,868
Why do you hide your true identity
with the illusion magic at my banquet!

356
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:19,995
Heavenly Empress!

357
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:08,325
It's you! God of Flower from Flower Palace -- Zi Fen!

358
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:10,535
You took a good care of your skin!

359
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:11,535
You look so young,

360
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,047
and prettier than before!

361
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:16,509
God of wine! Are you drunk or insane?!

362
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,515
Zi Fen has been dead for thousands of years

363
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:21,935
Exactly!

364
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:23,855
God of Wine, you'd better be sober now!

365
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,535
This is not Zi Fen!

366
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,435
This is the attendant of Xu Feng -- Jin Mi!

367
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:38,435
The red threads in my palace are all messed up.

368
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:41,135
It made me dizzy trying to untie those knots

369
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:42,868
So that I forgot the time.

370
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:45,495
Hope that my brother and sister won't blame me.

371
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:50,792
This is Jin Mi, it's really nice
to see Heavenly Empress and Empress

372
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:54,135
Jin Mi... you look just like her...

373
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:57,135
Could you tell me where you are from, Fairy Jin Mi?

374
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,535
Brother, you are so isolated from the outside world

375
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:03,975
Jin Mi just lived in Phoenix's Palace

376
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:07,855
Phoenix has taken care of her for a long time

377
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:12,975
My son, could you tell me where
you could find a fairy so pretty like this?

378
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:17,275
Jin Mi is randomly picked up by Phoenix

379
00:26:17,695 --> 00:26:19,935
No, Fairy fox misunderstood

380
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:22,255
I picked up Phoenix by accident

381
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,959
I feel shy to mention it...

382
00:26:25,657 --> 00:26:28,212
But I have saved Phoenix's life for three times

383
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:33,135
Are you the one who gave the night spirit the hairpin made from a vine

384
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:36,715
and helped Fire Immortal go through trials and tribulations?

385
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,655
Yes, that is me

386
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,855
as you just said

387
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:47,763
Heavenly Empress and I have to
thank Fairy Jin Mi for saving our son's lives

388
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,215
My pleasure! Not worth to mentioning it!

389
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:51,775
It’s not a big deal

390
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:54,228
Could you tell us

391
00:26:55,568 --> 00:26:56,730
where did you meet Fire Immortal by accident?

392
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,575
in The Water Mirror!

393
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:05,095
Oh! Why did I say that! Chiefs would definitely catch me back home.

394
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,455
Fairy Jin Mi, are you a Flower Fairy?

395
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:08,815
No

396
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,869
I am just a spirit of fruit

397
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:12,555
Fruit?

398
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,055
I am a spirit of grape

399
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,415
Could you tell us how old are you?

400
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,785
Around 4 thousand years

401
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:25,975
I could understand that Heavenly Empress and Empress
want to find a good match for the Phoenix

402
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,975
But she is just a shy little girl

403
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:32,075
Please don't be so straight forward

404
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:39,595
I heard that Sui He prepared something special for Empress's Birthday

405
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:42,295
She prepared a dance called Feathers Dancing in Clouds

406
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:46,653
Don’t know if Heavenly Empress is ready to watch it with me

407
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:47,795
Sure

408
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:56,996
Let’s go and sit there

409
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:01,709
Take a seat

410
00:29:40,976 --> 00:29:41,784
Good!

411
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:56,255
All the bird fairies and I, wish Heavenly Empress Happy Birthday!

412
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,095
Wish the Empress live long and prosper

413
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:00,055
You are so sweet Sui He

414
00:30:00,335 --> 00:30:04,975
I wouldn't ask for more if Phoenix could be as considerate as you

415
00:30:05,401 --> 00:30:07,015
Thank you so much for the compliment!

416
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:10,275
I was nothing compared to Fire Immortal

417
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:13,185
Fire Immortal is such a fierce fighter conquering around

418
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:15,255
We are family

419
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:19,235
We should spend more time together and become more intimate

420
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:22,515
Please sit by Xu Feng's side

421
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,235
And it would be more convenient for me to talk with you

422
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:38,025
Today is auntie's birthday.

423
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:39,860
Let’s drink more holy wine to celebrate

424
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:52,175
Mi, how do you feel when watching this scene? Aren't you jealous?

425
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,615
You do feel jealous!

426
00:30:58,415 --> 00:30:59,212
I don't feel anything at all

427
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:01,965
I just feel so familiar with this scene

428
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:05,615
Heavenly Empress, see these two

429
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:06,915
Sitting there

430
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:12,075
The scene is like the picture that
hangs on the wall at my personal palace

431
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:15,215
The picture depicts a lovely couple
walking in the spring drizzling rain

432
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:22,234
I remember that there's a title for the picture,
"A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade"

433
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:25,988
Oh, yeah! I remembered it!
It is exactly A Perfect Match of Pearl and Jade!

434
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:28,907
I saw the scene from the Picture book
--Tianxiang Secret book

435
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,743
So the Peacock Fairy has done spirit training with Phoenix

436
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,085
You are talking nonsense!

437
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:35,835
I did not make it up

438
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:40,175
I just wonder if the Peacock Princess
is willing to share me some tips about spirit training

439
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:42,042
So that we can increase our magic power
and make a progress together!

440
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:43,463
How dare you say that!

441
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:45,376
How dare you say those offensive things!

442
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:50,466
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess!
Drag her out of this holy palace and kill her immediately!

443
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:51,554
Wait!

444
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:57,043
Today is Heavenly Empress's birthday,
it is supposed to be a day full of joy!

445
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:59,728
It is not a day for killing. Reconsider your decision please, Mother!

446
00:32:00,307 --> 00:32:04,743
This kid is from Floral Realm.
I'm afraid that she knows nothing about Heaven disciplines

447
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:07,159
Please be merciful, Heavenly Empress!

448
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:09,235
What she said is just so offensive and indecent

449
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:12,375
It offended our dignity and honor

450
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,375
It is impossible for me to forgive it

451
00:32:18,575 --> 00:32:20,135
Calm down, Heavenly Empress

452
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,875
If you want to punish her, please punish me first

453
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,435
Jin Mi is my best friend

454
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:28,375
If it is not me telling her
that today is the birthday celebration

455
00:32:29,075 --> 00:32:31,095
Jin Mi wouldn't be here

456
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,085
I will take full responsibility of that

457
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:37,675
your hairpin has the other pair, hasn't it?

458
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:42,144
So, if the spirit of grape is the one you just mentioned?
Is she your best friend who gave you the hairpin?

459
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,475
If my memory is correct

460
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:48,735
Night Immortal just mentioned that the one
who gave you the vine hairpin is not here

461
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:51,415
So you were lying to us

462
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,675
Do you intend to take the blame

463
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,655
to cover her up?

464
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:58,115
I am willing to take any punishment

465
00:32:58,355 --> 00:32:59,715
and won't complain a word!

466
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:16,302
Phoenix Feather!

467
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,655
I don't know that Phoenix Feather is as powerful as an Amulet!

468
00:33:27,335 --> 00:33:28,335
Xu Feng!

469
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,795
Hope Heavenly Empress would forgive her this time!

470
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,175
Empress, please, give her one more chance

471
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,975
How dare you! The Snake Fairy!

472
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:47,290
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess, catch them!

473
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,175
Yes, Your highness!

474
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:56,215
Sorry for interrupting your birthday, Heavenly Empress

475
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,955
I will take the responsibility
and the punishment after coJin Mig back

476
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,315
Xu Feng!

477
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,495
It is my fault, I can't let Fire Immortal take the responsibility

478
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:06,224
I'm gonna go and make up for my mistake

479
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:07,675
I'll come back later!

480
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,635
Oh my god

481
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:31,815
I moved so fast, sorry for those poor Heaven guardians
since they are unable to catch us!

482
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,875
I am such a powerful man!

483
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:36,879
Lord Puchi

484
00:34:37,801 --> 00:34:40,435
Thank you so much! You saved my life again!

485
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,302
So... How would you pay back to me

486
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:47,015
What do you want?

487
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:49,391
How about being my woman

488
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,893
We can explore the secrets of spirit training

489
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:53,855
Spirit training?

490
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,635
Do you wanna turn into ashes?!

491
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:01,355
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess are coming soon, come with me!

492
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:07,395
I wonder why Fire Immortal wants to turn me into ashes

493
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,295
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you

494
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:14,555
If you keep trying step over my bottom line,
I would turn you into ashes in seconds

495
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:18,575
Maybe he is the only one who can protect Jin Mi

496
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:24,735
My little beauty, sad that we have feelings
with each other but intervened by others

497
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:28,395
No worries, I will train myself hard, then take you back!

498
00:35:33,495 --> 00:35:36,175
Going to the Birthday Celebration was

499
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,835
just for a bite of the holy peach to increase my magic power

500
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:42,295
would you catch me back to the Heaven Palace and let Empress kill me?

501
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,905
let her kill you?

502
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:49,595
I only have one Phoenix Feather

503
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:50,855
and I give it to you

504
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,675
Why you still cannot understand my heart?

505
00:35:55,668 --> 00:35:57,335
Even though...

506
00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,795
We are destined to be separated

507
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:06,515
Thank you

508
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,235
Please wear this Phoenix Feather

509
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,275
Wish it could protect you for me,
protect you to be safe and secure

510
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:27,234
I'm gonna send you back to Floral Realm right now

511
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:31,614
After you come back home, we will never meet each other again

512
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:45,377
Fairy Jin Mi

513
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:47,838
Fish Fairy!

514
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:48,588
Are you alright?

515
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:53,835
Chief Peony

516
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:57,535
It is great that Fire Immortal has made this decision

517
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:00,655
Chief Peony

518
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:04,187
No worries, I am a rational person

519
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:07,815
Now that I know that Jin Mi is related to me,
I definitely don't wanna bring any trouble to her

520
00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:10,818
Fire Immortal is such an understanding person

521
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:12,820
Please keep the secret

522
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:15,035
for peace of Floral Realm

523
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:16,875
What? What’s the secret?

524
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:18,535
Stop asking!

525
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:21,411
If not the flowers here sent us signals,
it would be so hard for us to track you

526
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,815
How long do you plan to hide from us!

527
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:25,290
Today is the Birthday Celebration of Heavenly Empress

528
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:27,995
Jin Mi got in accidentally and exposed her true identity.

529
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,874
Heavenly Empress and Empress became suspicious about her identity

530
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:30,545
At this moment

531
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:36,075
The Heaven Guardians are looking for Jin Mi

532
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,675
What? Jin Mi!

533
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,775
I don't mean to bring troubles to you guys!

534
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:42,915
There was a rat which freaked me out

535
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,101
I'm not surprised at all.. if you were not a trouble maker

536
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:47,675
Moon Immortal would be the Heavenly Empress someday

537
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,777
Your Highness, Fire Immortal. We took an order from the Empress,

538
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:57,295
Fire Immortal, please don't be in the way

539
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,407
Jin Mi is the spirit of Floral Realm

540
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,035
No matter what mistakes she made, she can only
be judged according to the Rules of Floral Realm

541
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:06,415
Anyone who's not from Floral Realm has no right
to do anything to her

542
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,917
There are 36 Heaven Generals and
millions Heaven Guardians in Heaven Realm

543
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,210
If I remembered correctly,

544
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:15,015
none of them is under charge of Heavenly Empress

545
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,005
Thunder God and Lightning Goddess,

546
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,173
you guys probably forgot whom you guys should follow

547
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:23,875
Calm down, Your Highness, we are followers of the you

548
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,505
Certainly, we should take orders from you

549
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,940
So, take my order right now,

550
00:38:28,124 --> 00:38:30,262
bring Heaven Guardians back to Heaven Realm immediately!

551
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:33,495
I will explain to Heavenly Empress in person

552
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:35,055
Yes, your Highness.

553
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:41,775
Two Chiefs

554
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:46,034
It is me who broke in the Water Mirror and took Jin Mi out

555
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:51,075
I did not expect to make so many troubles. My apology!

556
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:54,585
Two honorable immortals from Heaven
bursted into our place many times

557
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,377
We have just figured out why Fire Immortal
accidentally got in our place

558
00:38:56,855 --> 00:38:59,055
Could you explain the intention of breaking into our place?

559
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:03,055
Fairy Jin Mi is such an outgoing and energetic lady.
She is curious about everything

560
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:07,888
But she seems unhappy to be restricted in the Water Mirror

561
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:10,266
As a friend of Fairy Jin Mi

562
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,826
I just want her to have more freedom

563
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:15,729
I don't think you are honest to us

564
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,365
Fire Immortal is pretty straight forward

565
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:21,276
Why can't Night Immortal tell us the truth

566
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:26,075
I have never done anything that cross the line,
so I am telling the truth

567
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:29,095
I do treat her as my friend

568
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:33,121
Two Chiefs, please don't blame on Fish Fairy

569
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:35,540
Fish Fairy is a good dragon, and I like him

570
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:36,833
What did you just say?!

571
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:40,255
I said, Fish Fairy is a good dragon, I...
