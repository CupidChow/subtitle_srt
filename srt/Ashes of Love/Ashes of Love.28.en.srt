"Ashes of Love"

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,240
"Episode 28"

3
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Great! Great!

4
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,760
Well said!

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Well said!

6
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Right at that moment,

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,800
leader of the enemy
came to the front of King Yi.

8
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
They both held long swords
and rushed to each other…

9
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,560
Wrong.

10
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,320
Yes. Back then, King Yi

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,360
was really trapped

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,640
and besieged by the enemy,

13
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,800
being in a very dangerous situation.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
However, King Yi showed no fear on his face

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,240
but upheld his sword and rushed to the enemy

16
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,680
to defeat them greatly.

17
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,080
King Yi escaped from the siege at last.

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,240
As the saying goes,

19
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,320
destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

20
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
King Yi stretched out his sword

21
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,720
and beat away the long spear
in hands of the leader of the enemy.

22
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,640
Before the leader of the enemy realized it,

23
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,560
King Yi had placed his sword

24
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,400
around his neck.

25
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,600
Great! Great! Great!

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,360
Lady,

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
are you the story teller?

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,640
You want to replace my job?

29
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,760
I just feel that

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
what you said was not the truth,

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
so I said something.

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,240
I’m sorry. You go on. Go on.

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Sorry. Please go on. Go on.

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
Go. Go.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,480
Let’s go. Let’s go.

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,560
Jin Mi,

37
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,600
how come you know a lot about King Yi?

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Well,

39
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,840
when I acted with him a few days ago,

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,240
I heard Qin Tong telling
these stories on the battlefield.

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Then I remember them.

42
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,000
How about later?

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,880
What happened after you were besieged by them?

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,920
Water.

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,840
You can leave.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,040
Your Majesty,

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,840
you haven’t told me the later stories.

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
Our play of pretending sick

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
won’t end in a day.

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,720
You can come here tomorrow.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
It’s not urgent.

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,040
It’s to be continued.

54
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
All right. I’m leaving now.

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
Saint Girl, you are finally back.

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,160
Please go

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
to see His Majesty with me now.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
His Majesty?

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,960
What’s wrong with him?

60
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
You can learn it after you go to see him.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Please.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
His Majesty invites Saint Girl only.

"Peace reigns over the land"

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,120
Your Majesty, what happened?

65
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Come to take a seat.

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
Sit here.

67
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
You like to make Phoenix Lantern, right?

68
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,880
We can make one today.

69
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
But I don’t know how to make it.

70
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
I know. You can help me.

71
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
Are you OK? I’m fine.

72
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,378
"Beiyuan Villa"

73
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Your Majesty, I hinder you.

74
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
You are clear about this.

75
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,320
But its look is not so bad.

76
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,400
This is the Phoenix Lantern we make together.

77
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
Can I keep it?

78
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,520
Sure.

79
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,520
Don’t give me such an ugly lantern.

80
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,360
I won’t give you this lantern.

81
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
But, follow me.

82
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>Wind blows gently.</i>

83
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,960
<i>Separated heaven and earth are far from each other.</i>

84
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,280
<i>But so what?</i>

85
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>Moonlight links the missing.</i>

86
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,480
<i>Write a love letter as the starting.</i>

87
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,280
<i>A paragraph for ten thousands years
and one line for a thousand years.</i>

88
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>A thousand years…</i>

89
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,120
These Phoenix Lanterns are all the gifts for you.

90
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,160
Do you like them?

91
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,005
<i>From the love letter, </i>

92
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,920
<i>I find the places we will meet in each life.</i>

93
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>I will be there...</i>

94
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,920
They were made by me when I first learned how to make it.

95
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,040
I wanted to throw these ugly lanterns away.

96
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
You made all of them?

97
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
<i>I will sing there,</i>

98
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,840
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

99
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,760
<i>From the love letter,</i>

100
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,160
<i>I find the places where I will make wishes.</i>

101
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,840
<i>I will plant a red lotus</i>

102
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,120
<i>to fume times with its aroma.</i>

103
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,720
<i>From the love letter,</i>

104
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,120
<i>I find the places where
we will fall in love in each life.</i>

105
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,760
<i>I will sing there,</i>

106
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,040
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

107
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,760
If you don’t like them,

108
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
just throw them away later.

109
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,840
I like them. I like them all!

110
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,840
<i>From the love letter, </i>

111
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
<i>I find the places where
we will meet in each life.</i>

112
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,400
<i>I will wait for you there</i>

113
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
<i>to enjoy the sunset together.</i>

114
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,960
No. Jin Mi, sober up.

115
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,960
He is King Yi and you are
Saint Girl of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

116
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,960
How can you have love for him?

117
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,400
Why is his smile so charming?

118
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,480
I must be too nervous recently,

119
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,440
so I have such wild thoughts.

120
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I’ll recover after taking a Mind Relief Pill.

121
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>From the love letter, </i>

122
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,920
<i>I find the places where
we will fall in love in each life.</i>

123
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,640
<i>I will sing there,</i>

124
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,280
<i>playing the moonlight.</i>

125
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,640
Jin Mi.

126
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
Your Majesty.

127
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,600
I’m a little tired.
Please forgive me for leaving now.

128
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,560
I miss such a good chance again.

129
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,160
Should I stop her just now?

130
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,800
I think

131
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
you should stop her.

132
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
Send these lanterns to her palace.

133
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,168
Your Highness,

134
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:30,520
I learned that His Majesty
personally made a yard of Phoenix Lanterns

135
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,000
for…

136
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,040
For what?

137
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,360
For that Saint Girl.

138
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,000
What? She?

139
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,200
Unexpectedly, I belittled her.

140
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,000
OK. You can leave.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Yes.

142
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,320
In this world,

143
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,840
no one can rob my cousin away.

144
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,640
You!

145
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Princess Sui He,

146
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000
as ordered by Heavenly Empress,

147
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
I come to restore your memory.

148
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,680
Sorry to offend you.

149
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,840
Jin Mi,

150
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,360
you even compete with me

151
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
in Xu Feng in the mortal world.

152
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,280
Sorry to offend you just now.

153
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,920
How come Jin Mi is still alive?

154
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,800
My fault.

155
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,440
I lost the Spirit-Vanishing Arrow.

156
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,600
Without Spirit-Vanishing Arrow,

157
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
you should try to perish her as well.

158
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,480
She can’t be with Xu Feng.

159
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,600
Got it?

160
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,800
Yes.

161
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,880
Dong Ruixi is dead.

162
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
My Lord, you can rest assured.

163
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
He won’t cause any threat to you.

164
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,480
Is there any trace left behind?

165
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,520
Although Minister Fu doubts it,

166
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,400
he can’t find any proof.

167
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,960
He has confirmed that Dong Ruixi
committed suicide to avoid punishment.

168
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Dad.

169
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,200
I want to talk with you.

170
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,680
You can leave now.

171
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,360
Yes.

172
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,560
Dad.

173
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Now Xu Feng,

174
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,040
cousin is healthy.

175
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,320
My marriage with him should be on the agenda.

176
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,520
Sui He.

177
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Dad.

178
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,880
I know what you want.

179
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,640
But after the Meeting of Commanding Officers,

180
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,920
it will be hard to drag him down from the throne.

181
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,000
But if you marry me to him,

182
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,840
our son later

183
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,360
will also call you grandpa.

184
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,840
You will still be powerful

185
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,680
with supreme authority.

186
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
Since Sui He insists on this,

187
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
I can agree to her.

188
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,320
Now King Yi and I are irreconcilable.

189
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,160
If she really can marry Xu Feng,

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,960
I can keep my power.

191
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
But if Xu Feng refuses to marry her,

192
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,640
I can launch the uprising later.

193
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,240
Dad.

194
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,880
You win.

195
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,480
OK.

196
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,360
I will ask them to send memorials in a few days

197
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,720
to urge Xu Feng to get married

198
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,600
to realize your love dream.

199
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
You are the nicest to me.

200
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,160
I grounded you in your room a few days ago,

201
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
have you forgiven me?

202
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
You can’t ground me later.

203
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
OK.

204
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
I promise.

205
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,120
I promise.

206
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,800
"Beiyuan Villa"

207
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,160
They wanted to drag me down
from the throne yesterday,

208
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,080
but now they hand in memorials one by one

209
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
to remind me of my marriage with Sui He

210
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
for the sake of my inheritor.

211
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
Duke Nanping

212
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,840
always has ways to irritate me.

213
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,240
I think

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,680
what these ministers say seems right.

215
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
Your Majesty has reached the marriage-age

216
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,720
and should get married indeed.

217
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,760
They don’t know my thoughts,

218
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
but you don’t know me either?

219
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,520
But I heard from the old that,

220
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,640
if a man is not close to women for long,

221
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
he will easily…

222
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,760
What?

223
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,000
He will easily,

224
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,720
get irritated as you.

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,840
Qin Tong,

226
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,400
you worry about more and more recently.

227
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Your Majesty,

228
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
Saint Girl sent a memorial just now.

229
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,560
Should I

230
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
leave her go?

231
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,720
It depends on your heart.

232
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,760
The Spirit-Vanishing Arrow actually hangs still.

233
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,240
Xu Feng,

234
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,880
it seems that this is the heavenly fate.

235
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,360
You can leave.

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,960
What are you looking at?

237
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,160
Moon Immortal.

238
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
How come you are here as well?

239
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,240
I worry about Xu Feng and Jin Mi,

240
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,840
so I specially come here to take a look.

241
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Lord Yan You, why are you here?

242
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
I’m an old friend of Jin Mi’s.

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,720
So I come here to see whether she is fine.

244
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,960
You know what?

245
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,280
When Xu Feng was leaving,

246
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,560
I tied him with Jin Mi

247
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,240
with a red rope.

248
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,240
Maybe they two

249
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,720
now have been married.

250
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,560
How come Xu Feng seems so worried?

251
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
Do you know what he worries about?

252
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Duke Nanping in Huaiwu has a daughter

253
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
called Sui He.

254
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,400
She has a marriage agreement with Xu Feng.

255
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,240
Now his ministers hand in memorials

256
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
to advise him to marry her as soon as possible.

257
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,240
Sui He?

258
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,680
Which Sui He?

259
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,160
That Princess of Bird Family?

260
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,880
No, no, no.

261
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
I don’t like Sui He.

262
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,120
She is not worthy of Xu Feng.

263
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
How can I do?

264
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,440
I have an idea.

265
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,400
It may help Xu Feng.

266
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,760
Tell me.

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,840
Great.

268
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,640
Good idea.

269
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,720
Lord Yan You, you are really creative.

270
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,200
Qin Tong,

271
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
bring me several pots of osmanthus flower wine.

272
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,800
How come Your Majesty
is in such an aesthetic mood?

273
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,840
After coming back from the battlefield,

274
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,360
I have never seen you drinking wine.

275
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,800
It’s hard to win this battle.

276
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,080
I need to brave myself with wine.

277
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,080
I’ll go fetch some.

278
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,720
I sent the memorial

279
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,720
for begging to go back to
Saint Doctors’ Family days ago,

280
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
why doesn’t Crow replay me?

281
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,800
If I continue to stay here,

282
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,040
how can I manage my love?

283
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,040
I’d better leave

284
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,000
to be far away from him,

285
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
missing him in the rest of my life.

286
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,640
Your Majesty, you are drunk?

287
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Today, Duke Nanping unites
all officers to hand in memorials,

288
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,080
urging me to marry Sui He.

289
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
Your Majesty has great  civil and military skills

290
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,240
and Princess is noble and elegant.

291
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,920
It’s a good thing for you to be a perfect match.

292
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,360
Good thing?

293
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,040
Your Majesty,

294
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
have you seen my memorial

295
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,480
of begging to go back to Saint Doctors’ Family?

296
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
You once promised me a wish.

297
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I thought

298
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,600
you wanted a decree for pardon
about not being buried alive with me.

299
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,480
That’s the century-old family rule.

300
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,440
I,

301
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,920
dare not to disobey it.

302
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
At the first sight of your eyes,

303
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,120
I felt you were very familiar.

304
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,600
Living with you every day later,

305
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,840
I didn’t want to leave even if I had been recovered.

306
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,880
After I came back,

307
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,080
I planned to find you after pacifying the court.

308
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
Unexpectedly, Duke Nanping

309
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,280
called you to Beiyuan Villa.

310
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,360
I was happy and frightened.

311
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,760
I was happy

312
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,320
because I met you earlier.

313
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,360
I was frightened

314
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,680
because I worried you would be in dangers.

315
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,840
My identity as Saint Girl

316
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,160
won’t be changed.

317
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,640
When I’m alive,

318
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,240
I’m your person.

319
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,920
Even I’m dead,

320
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,440
I will be your dead person.

321
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,480
That’s the century-old family rule
of the Saint Doctors’ Family.

322
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,200
I will accompany you no matter I’m alive or dead.

323
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
What are you saying?

324
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,800
I don’t want you to be buried alive for me.

325
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
Instead, I want you to live well.

326
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,080
I don’t want you to be my dad person.

327
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
I just want you to be my woman.

328
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,600
I surely don’t want to be buried alive.

329
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
But if I violate the family rule,

330
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
I won’t be alive tomorrow

331
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,600
before I’m buried alive.

332
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
If you are willing,

333
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,800
I can find a way

334
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,560
to let you get rid of the identity of Saint Girl.

335
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,292
Escape by pretend-dead.

336
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,400
You only need to pretend ill for several days

337
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,840
and you will be claimed death.

338
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,440
Then I will hide you in the folk.

339
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,000
After a period of time,

340
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,160
you will be welcomed back to the palace

341
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,360
as the daughter of an officer.

342
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,680
No.

343
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,960
Even you have 1,000 ways to protect me,

344
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,800
the Saint Doctors’ Family will have 1,001 ways

345
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,960
to kill me.

346
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,560
Do I need to fear the Saint Doctors’ Family?

347
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
If they make you buried alive with me,

348
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,840
I will bury all of them alive for you.

349
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Your Majesty,

350
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
please don’t do this.

351
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,520
I love medicine since my childhood.

352
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,880
It was true in the past

353
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,480
and won’t be changed in the future.

354
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,680
Moreover, you have never met my face.

355
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,320
Under my veil,

356
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
my face is so ugly.

357
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
Am I so superficial

358
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,400
in your eyes?

359
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,880
No.

360
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,840
You are a wise king in my eyes.

361
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,800
But you have your heavenly fate

362
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,800
and I have my duties.

363
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,240
The match of King Yi and Saint Girl

364
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
will ruin the rules.

365
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,800
If someone takes advantage from this,

366
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,280
it will be a taint for you,

367
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
which will be adverse for you.

368
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,040
My love for you

369
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,840
is even a taint in your eyes?

370
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,760
Your Majesty, you shouldn’t garble my words.

371
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,600
I just think that

372
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,720
you should set store by overall interests

373
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,840
and create a peaceful and prosperous state

374
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,520
for common people.

375
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
Does creating a peaceful and prosperous state
for common people

376
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,360
conflict with being together with you?

377
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
Am I so unreliable

378
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,160
in your heart?

379
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I won’t approve of

380
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,000
your memorial.

381
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,080
It seems that you are drunk greatly.

382
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,800
I’d like to cook a bowl of sober soup for you.

383
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,240
No need to leave.

384
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,840
I’ll leave.

385
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,920
"With your heart, we’ll never be apart."

386
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,840
Your Majesty,

387
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,320
I think

388
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,560
that you haven’t got married and have no child,

389
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,280
will make people restless.

390
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
You should get married earlier

391
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,000
and take several consorts

392
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,840
for reproduction.

393
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
A wise king should have a wife and consorts.

394
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,680
In my opinion,

395
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,320
taking consorts is not urgent.

396
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,840
What’s important to determine the queen earlier.

397
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,240
Recently, Liangguo has still sought chance

398
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,520
to eliminate our state.

399
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,360
Tu people from the south

400
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,040
and Huoluo people from the north

401
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,320
have repeatedly invaded our state

402
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,720
and provoked our bottom line.

403
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,400
Under such a current situation,

404
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,760
I have no mind to think over my marriage.

405
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,360
However, Your Majesty...

406
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
As long as we can’t eliminate enemies

407
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
to unite the state,

408
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,840
I’ll

409
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,120
never get married.

410
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,160
The marriage of Your Majesty with Sui He
was determined by the late King.

411
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,000
Since Your Majesty is healthy now,

412
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,840
Your Majesty should marry her to have heir

413
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,280
for the state earlier.

414
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,560
It’s late.

415
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,680
Just leave.

416
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,280
I’m leaving.

417
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,640
Saint Girl,

418
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,800
I heard that today

419
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,600
Duke Nanping and Minister Fu
urged King Yi to get married earlier,

420
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,160
but King Yi said

421
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,800
he won’t get married

422
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
before enemies are eliminated

423
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,280
to unify the state.

424
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,960
I didn’t expect that King Yi
is so firm and unyielding.

425
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,840
His tough and lofty belief

426
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,680
are really admirable.

427
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Be careful.

428
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,560
Has the memorial you submitted
got the approval from His Majesty?

429
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,480
How long do you want to stay here?

430
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,720
I have no idea, either.

431
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
I think as His Majesty has so many
important matters to concern about,

432
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,640
he can’t consider us at the time being.

433
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,920
You live comfortably here,

434
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,520
but do you know...

435
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
Do you still want to go back to
the Saint Doctors’ Family?

436
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,720
If l leave,

437
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,920
will I meet him again in my life?

438
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,120
It doesn’t matter to
stay here for several more days.

439
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,960
It doesn’t matter.

440
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,760
Goodbye.

441
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,720
Your Highness,

442
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
you actually can ask us

443
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
to do these things

444
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,400
instead of coming here personally.

445
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,960
I’ve been looking forward to

446
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,760
the marriage with cousin for a long time.

447
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,600
Now that the wedding date is to be set,

448
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,560
naturally I want to do it personally

449
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,880
to make it perfect.

450
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
Everyone knows your love for His Majesty.

451
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,560
His Majesty will take
good care of you in the future.

452
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,480
Although it’s just
a short moment in the mortal world,

453
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,200
it’s great

454
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,880
to marry Xu Feng.

455
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,840
Yan You.

456
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,400
What do you want to do?

457
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,080
It seems that you’ve recovered
your memories in Heavenly Realm.

458
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,760
What a pity!

459
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,040
I still like the silly and innocent you

460
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,200
a few days ago.

461
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,400
Freeze.

462
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,320
You...

463
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,160
Although you have the memories,

464
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,360
you’re still a human.

465
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,960
Princess Sui He,

466
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,840
you shouldn’t have expected that

467
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
you’ll be treated by me in this way, right?

468
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,320
Yan You,

469
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,920
what on earth do you want to do?

470
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,800
I want to do many things to you.

471
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
Where should I begin?

472
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,160
As soon as I return to the Heaven Realm,

473
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,880
Just wait and see!

474
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,040
See what?

475
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,280
I’m so good-looking

476
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,520
that I can't be better.

477
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,200
Cause I’m afraid that girls
in heaven and on earth

478
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,280
will be jealous of my beauty.

479
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,800
You’re shameless.

480
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Shameless?

481
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,600
I’m shameless?

482
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,560
In this regard,

483
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,200
I’m absolutely inferior to you.

484
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,760
I can remember clearly what you did to me

485
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
in the Haven Realm back then.

486
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,600
Today,

487
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,880
let’s make it clearly.

488
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
Yan You.

489
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,320
What?

490
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,960
The princess is missing.

491
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,280
Originally, she was talking
with me in the carriage,

492
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,760
but somehow I fainted.

493
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,760
When I came back to life,
she was found nowhere.

494
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,480
Qi Chong.

495
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,080
Yes.

496
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,160
Send people to search around the city

497
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
to find princess at all costs.

498
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,440
Yes.

499
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,680
Honghong, Honghong,

500
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,440
we’ve made an appointment to meet each other.

501
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,000
Where has she been?

502
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,640
Lian Qiao, Lian Qiao

503
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,920
come here.

504
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,120
What’s wrong, Mr. Hu?

505
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Do you know where

506
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,960
Moon Immortal has been?

507
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,680
He said he was too urgent

508
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
to wait for you to match

509
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
Jin Mi and his second nephew in the mortal world.

510
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
He just left us behind.

511
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
Well, this old fox

512
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,320
always acts at will.

513
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,600
Your Majesty,

514
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,000
Duke Nanping reported that

515
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,320
Princess Sui He is missing.

516
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,200
Duke Nanping hopes that you can also send people

517
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
to search for the princess.

518
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,800
What does he want to do?

519
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,560
Well,

520
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,480
Sui He is different from her dad.

521
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,960
Send someone to search for her.

522
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,680
No need.

523
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
The princess

524
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,760
is here right now.

525
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,840
What?

526
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,560
Just now she came with a man

527
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,600
called Puchi Jun

528
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,360
and asked for the decision of Your Majesty.

529
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,400
Your Highness.

530
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,320
Your Highness.

531
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,240
Your Highness.

532
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,040
Do you think

533
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,400
Xu Feng will agree with our marriage?

534
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,720
Yan You,

535
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,760
let me go,

536
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,680
or you’ll pay dearly for it

537
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,360
when I return to the Heaven Realm.

538
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,280
Anyway, under your careful plan,

539
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,200
I’m already a criminal,

540
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,920
so I fear nothing.

541
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,480
What’s more,

542
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,160
I’m very happy to marry you

543
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,760
in the mortal world.

544
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
Cousin, I...

545
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,200
I won’t allow you to utter even a word from now on.

546
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Are you Puchi Jun?

547
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,200
I’m Puchi. Please take my respect.

548
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,200
Why do you

549
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
want to meet me?

550
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,560
I’m a hanger-on in Duke Nanping Palace.

551
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Accidentally, I was acquainted with Princess Sui He.

552
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,200
Though we have a great disparity in status,

553
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,640
we felt familiar at first sight
and fell in love with each other.

554
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
I know she’s engaged to you,

555
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,040
so I shouldn’t have held

556
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,400
an improper desire for her.

557
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,280
However, love won’t

558
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,720
be controlled by reason.

559
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,160
Now we are really in love with each other,

560
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
please permit us.

561
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Sui He,

562
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,960
do you also love him?

563
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,240
It’s my turn.

564
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Cousin.

565
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,760
we are really gone on each other,

566
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,560
please permit us.

567
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,920
Yan You,

568
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,560
you even have a helper.

569
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,240
How dare you conjure the Puppet Incantation to me!

570
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,200
When I return to the Heaven Realm someday,

571
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,040
I’ll grind bones of you two to dust.

572
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,200
My waist.

573
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
My waist.

574
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,080
Your Majesty,

575
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,520
I’ve prepared for the worst

576
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,240
as I came here.

577
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,160
If you want to punish,

578
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,480
just punish me.

579
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,880
Don’t hurt the princess.

580
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,000
Isn’t she Princess Sui He?

581
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Love arising secretly

582
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,000
becomes deeper and deeper.

583
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,800
It’s really a blessing

584
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,680
to meet the one you love and loves you

585
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,840
in a short life,

586
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,600
so never give up easily.

587
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Since you love each other,

588
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,080
I would like to help you.

589
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,480
I’ll abolish the engagement with Sui He,

590
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,600
to return her freedom

591
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,560
to marry anyone she likes.

592
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,960
You’re wise, Your Majesty.

593
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,240
Thanks for your permission.

594
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,080
Please rise.

595
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,960
We’ll love each other afterwards

596
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,320
to live up to your help.

597
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,040
Isn’t Princess Sui He always

598
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,400
persistent in King Yi?

599
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,080
Why does she change her mind suddenly?

600
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,160
Moreover, King Yi

601
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
even agreed with them,

602
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,240
which is more wonderful than opera.

603
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,400
Don’t you go to listen to the storytelling?

604
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,320
Storytelling isn’t

605
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
as wonderful as this.

606
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,320
Let’s go.

607
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,440
Please rise.

608
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,920
This plan is really amazing.

609
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,560
Let’s go.

610
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,080
Your Highness.

611
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,160
I’ll go to the mortal world.

612
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
Perhaps someone can give me the answer

613
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,360
about Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and Magic Fireballs.

614
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,960
Who?

615
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,520
Kuang Lu,

616
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,280
guard the Xuanji Palace.

617
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,440
I’ll be back soon.

618
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
What’s the connection between

619
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:50,280
Spirit-Vanishing Arrow and Magic Fireballs?

620
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,840
Who can

621
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,760
answer this?
