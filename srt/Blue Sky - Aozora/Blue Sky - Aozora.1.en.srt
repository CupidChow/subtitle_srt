1
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:45,552
Traves

2
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,569
Tokyo is really far away

3
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,673
Very far away

4
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,472
We will be there soon

5
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,054
Traves

6
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:19,257
We will be late if you don't wake up now

7
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:22,961
I forget to wake up

8
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:26,556
We are already late

9
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,069
What do we do?

10
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,904
Let's take a rest today

11
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,406
No please

12
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:38,410
Please don't do this during daytime

13
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,312
No please

14
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,685
You have to do the part-time job today

15
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,087
I just need to do the job in the afternoon

16
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:52,420
So I will go now

17
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,014
Traves

18
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,672
There is some curry in the pot

19
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,441
You can eat it

20
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:47,138
I know

21
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:12,404
Very noisy

22
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:17,671
How can I sleep

23
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,316
Miss

24
00:04:58,316 --> 00:04:59,417
There is no marble here

25
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:05,515
Please wait

26
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,030
Please don't do it

27
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,164
Cherry

28
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,432
Can we meet after work

29
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:15,734
Let's go for dinner

30
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,068
No way

31
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,737
Let's gamble for this

32
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:21,339
If I can gain 10 boxes of marbles, then you go with me

33
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,042
As you wish

34
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:26,177
No 401, you won the big prize

35
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,178
Attention

36
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,772
I am coming

37
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,885
Sorry for keep you waiting

38
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:38,890
Traves

39
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,158
Why don't you go for the part-time job today?

40
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,159
The store is off today

41
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,861
The manager went out for sex

42
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,962
Really?

43
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:45,063
Yes

44
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,098
Go and get the box for me now

45
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:50,068
The number of my machine is 401

46
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:54,472
Don't write it wrong

47
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,667
It is annoying

48
00:05:58,877 --> 00:06:01,112
You are a nice couple

49
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,014
Don't say that

50
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,317
Don't deny it

51
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:08,119
Are we as good as you think?

52
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:11,022
Great

53
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:15,220
No one with bother me playing today

54
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,293
Damn it

55
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:30,041
I have spent all of my money today

56
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,544
The machine should be out of order

57
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,345
No way

58
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,915
There should be some tricks

59
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:42,615
Or else, I will not lose 6 boxes of marbles

60
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,927
Cherry

61
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,136
I decided not to play marble games anymore

62
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:01,639
You said it for many times

63
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,342
Please lend some money to me

64
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,644
No way

65
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,879
I beg you

66
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,682
Lend me some money so I can got work tomorrow

67
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:14,052
You should have your monthly bus ticket

68
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,654
How about my lunch?

69
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:20,784
I will prepare a lunch box for you tomorrow

70
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,198
Zon

71
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,868
How are you?

72
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:33,071
You came at the right time

73
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:36,074
Come in

74
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,770
Sit down

75
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:50,688
Money?

76
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,390
What are you talking about?

77
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,125
I don't have money either

78
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,426
Don't lie

79
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:57,428
I didn't have dinner last night

80
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:59,497
So you come here tonight?

81
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:02,933
Not like this

82
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:07,238
Damn it

83
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:10,642
I lost 5 times continuously

84
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:14,512
So I lost all the money

85
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,614
I am so unlucky

86
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,449
You must be careful

87
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,351
Don't be unlucky as me

88
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,655
I have to tell you something

89
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:24,622
Traves

90
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,824
You should try your best

91
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:31,659
to be a more hard working guy

92
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,935
You are as coward as before

93
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:42,674
You will save some money each time

94
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,944
It is not bad to be like this

95
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:49,347
I can save a big sum of money at last

96
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:53,651
This is my life

97
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:56,287
No more nonsense

98
00:08:56,287 --> 00:09:00,458
Don't be indulge in playing marble games

99
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,859
Okay

100
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,363
I will not play the marble games anymore

101
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:07,065
Great

102
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:11,002
Did you forget your dream to be a musician?

103
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:13,004
Don't touch it

104
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,907
Let's sing

105
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:22,013
I will sing for you

106
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:29,487
You will see me on the TV soon

107
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:35,893
I will earn a living with my music talent

108
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:39,697
Don't bull shit

109
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:44,635
We shall not give up our dreams

110
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:52,007
Right?

111
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:59,117
Three of us

112
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:03,421
were born in a small town around Saga

113
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,922
Where we were in elementary school

114
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,925
Traves and Zon joined the baseball club

115
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,962
And I was your manager

116
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:14,065
But when we entered high school

117
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,934
Traves gave up baseball

118
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:20,238
And became a riot at last

119
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:22,740
Zon, after repeat for one school year

120
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,977
joined the riot group of Traves

121
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,346
And I went on studying in a girls college

122
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:31,682
I was worry about both of you

123
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:33,751
So after a while

124
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:37,055
I became a riot at last

125
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,491
Our group is violent and rebellious

126
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:45,263
And it was smooth for a long time

127
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:46,864
After I graduated from high school

128
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,801
Traves went to work in a food factory there

129
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,969
And I worked in a super market

130
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,304
Once

131
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:57,308
Traves discovered some food are expired

132
00:10:57,308 --> 00:11:00,311
And my boss wanted to cover it

133
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:04,382
Traves was angry and resigned

134
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:06,884
It was one year ago

135
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:10,388
I decided to quit my job in the supermarket

136
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:15,426
And I went away with Traves to Tokyo

137
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:17,895
When Zon discovered this case

138
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:21,132
He quit his job and ran away with us

139
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:24,035
Traves and Zon had their dreams

140
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:27,105
to become a successful musician

141
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:30,708
Although there was no progress until then

142
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:35,839
I always support them

143
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:39,613
Because I am in love with Traves

144
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,163
Cherry

145
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,306
Sorry

146
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,783
What's up?

147
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:50,588
I am useless

148
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:52,990
Don't say it

149
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,118
I never blame you

150
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:09,839
I promise you to bring you happiness

151
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:18,310
Please give me some time

152
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:30,525
I will find a job tomorrow

153
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,583
Great

154
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,742
Traves

155
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:55,446
Did you tell Cherry that you quit your job?

156
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:57,315
Of course I didn't tell her

157
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:00,518
It was me who hit the shop manager

158
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:04,855
Why did you hit him with no reason?

159
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:07,525
I hate him for his arrogance

160
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,627
A shop manager should be like this

161
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,262
You are troublesome

162
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:16,067
You quit your job also

163
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,437
It is because the shop manager is hostile to me

164
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:22,640
I was working very hard in the shop

165
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,165
Really?

166
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:32,945
Tokyo is a hard place to live in

167
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:43,160
When can we get away from this situation

168
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,962
What are you talking about?

169
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:47,665
If we are successful in this interview

170
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:51,669
We can be singers then

171
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:53,671
It will be great

172
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:58,309
But I didn't play very well

173
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:01,078
Have more confidence

174
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,413
Besides asking for talent,

175
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:06,713
they are asking for passion to music

176
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:18,729
Cherry

177
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,699
Let's go out and date today

178
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,002
He is a student of Tokyo University

179
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,104
Shall we?

180
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,340
I'd better not going

181
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,106
Sorry

182
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,651
What is it?

183
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,313
You have wasted your talent and beauty

184
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,223
A pretty girl like you

185
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:50,828
is deserved to have much more besides love

186
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:52,163
Not like this

187
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:56,267
Is it the purpose for you to come to Tokyo?

188
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,469
This is not my purpose to come to Tokyo

189
00:16:58,469 --> 00:16:59,336
Okay

190
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:04,273
I need to prepare for the dating today

191
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,250
My purpose to be here is...

192
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,992
And their purpose is...

193
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:15,207
I'm here because of Traves...

194
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,126
What's up?

195
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:30,728
Nothing

196
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:33,458
I will work harder tomorrow

197
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,138
to be with him...

198
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,516
I'm very happy

199
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:05,623
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

200
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:09,860
Don't put it out on me

201
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,362
Okay, let's go

202
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,130
We will be late if we don't leave now

203
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,119
I go now

204
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,839
Wait a moment

205
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,277
It is an amulet

206
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:29,146
Work hard

207
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,148
I will pray for you

208
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,948
Hurry up, Traves

209
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:47,653
Work hard, Work hard, Traves

210
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:34,843
It is noisy

211
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,418
Forget it

212
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:45,656
Your guitar is not good enough

213
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,524
Really?

214
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:51,153
Try to change it

215
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,729
Next is couple chorus

216
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:14,111
Sorry

217
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:18,415
I didn't change the string as I have no money

218
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,716
You don't have to say sorry

219
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:20,918
Work harder next time

220
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,820
I made some food

221
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,855
Let's eat together

222
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:26,223
But I didn't play very well

223
00:23:26,223 --> 00:23:31,061
But I encumbered Zon this time

224
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,530
It was me who encumbered you

225
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,732
Don't say it anymore

226
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:39,369
You too

227
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:43,237
I don't want to be like this

228
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,247
Sorry, Zon

229
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:52,049
He didn't mean to do this

230
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:57,544
I was useless

231
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:05,462
Sorry

232
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:07,564
I will clean it right away

233
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:10,294
About this...

234
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,327
What's up?

235
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:39,796
Can I stand up?

236
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:43,288
Please stand up

237
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:53,608
Stand up straight

238
00:24:56,113 --> 00:25:00,709
Can I speak with you?

239
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,250
This is my name card

240
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,346
Didn't you use your eyes to see when walking?

241
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:33,951
Dude, do you want to fight?

242
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,753
You want to die?

243
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:39,347
Sorry

244
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:44,861
Are you Traves?

245
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:51,368
Do you remember me?

246
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:53,070
Oh, it's Jackson

247
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,072
You are really in Tokyo

248
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:57,165
Great

249
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:04,214
It was a coincidence to see you

250
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:09,987
Jane, he is my friend Traves

251
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,189
How are you? I am Jane

252
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:13,890
Nice to meet you

253
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,993
Don't be too bashful

254
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,329
Come on, have a drink

255
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:23,233
Don't worry, it is my shop

256
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:26,737
Fantastic

257
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:30,907
The business is not bad here

258
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:33,543
What are you doing now?

259
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:38,315
I am jobless

260
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:40,517
What's up?

261
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:45,956
How can you live in Tokyo without a job?

262
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:51,428
Come to help me if you have time

263
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:55,665
Do you mean you can employ me?

264
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,634
Take it easy

265
00:26:57,634 --> 00:27:00,437
It is a legal business

266
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:04,741
I will not trick you here

267
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:08,145
The market of finance is popular now

268
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:12,682
A small shop like us will have some side business

269
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:16,853
So we can earn more money

270
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:19,356
Can you put it clearly?

271
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:22,659
Isn't it enough?

272
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,561
Great

273
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,588
Don't reveal it

274
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:35,405
They are out of control again

275
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,474
Sorry

276
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:38,975
Not at all

277
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:41,278
Because the finance of Japan is good

278
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,581
So they have time to play here

279
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:50,420
Our business is good because of them

280
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,123
Not bad

281
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:58,829
People without a job is useless

282
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:00,897
Yes, I know

283
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:02,299
How is it?

284
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:06,203
Do you want to work with me?

285
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:08,905
But...

286
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:12,042
You don't have to be too serious

287
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,312
Go home and consider it

288
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:17,814
Okay, let's drink

289
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:22,217
Okay, let's drink

290
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:48,478
I am home

291
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,379
You are home

292
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:56,644
Do you want to eat something?

293
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:01,291
What are you hiding?

294
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,393
Nothing

295
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:07,159
Let me see

296
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:23,079
It is that female manager

297
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,716
I saw her in today

298
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:30,487
Really?

299
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:34,024
She wants to employ you?

300
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,593
I am not interested

301
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,295
I just want to support you

302
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't know how to perform

303
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,305
Cherry, you can perform well

304
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:50,106
Don't say that

305
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:53,009
Don't lie

306
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:59,549
I know you want to be a singer when you was young

307
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:04,120
What did you write in your writing

308
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,122
I forgot it

309
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,757
You are drunk

310
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:12,729
Yes, I am drunk

311
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,165
Very bad?

312
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:18,623
Traves

313
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:45,061
Cherry

314
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,859
What's up?

315
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:54,504
You don't need to care about me anymore

316
00:30:54,504 --> 00:31:01,278
You can do something you want

317
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,382
You don't to care about anyone

318
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:09,682
Nonsense

319
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,720
Why do you say that?

320
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:26,703
What's up today?

321
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:30,407
It is a good day

322
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:33,109
You really want to find that guy

323
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,413
He doesn't seem to be a reliable guy

324
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:41,316
In fact, he is coward

325
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:50,927
Jane, pay the bill

326
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:53,129
Are you going home now?

327
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:58,863
Yes, this is it

328
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,278
Is it the bill?

329
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:14,951
800 thousand yen?

330
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:21,858
Are you kidding?

331
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:25,195
Anything not clear?

332
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,364
In fact...

333
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,900
Pay the bill now

334
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,064
Yes

335
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:39,575
I don't have enough money

336
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,212
Are you alright?

337
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:45,375
This is a bad side of the society

338
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:09,806
He comes here every day

339
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:15,011
You'd better break up with her

340
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:17,411
Don't care about me

341
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:21,918
Today, there is a dating gathering

342
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:25,822
The guys are wealthy and university student

343
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:28,224
He is a doctor student of Tokyo University

344
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:29,959
I will not go

345
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:35,465
It is a waste. This is a precious chance

346
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:36,733
Cherry

347
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:37,825
Give me a box

348
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,041
I am in a great status today

349
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,143
If I can win 10 boxes today

350
00:33:47,143 --> 00:33:48,478
Will you date with me?

351
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:50,480
I have never promised you for this

352
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,982
You really hate me?

353
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:55,752
Or you want to date with other guys?

354
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,955
You can't touch her like this

355
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:02,857
Who are you?

356
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:06,863
I keep on calling you

357
00:34:06,863 --> 00:34:08,364
Sorry

358
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:10,800
Let's go

359
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,269
I talked to the manager today

360
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,272
I have something to discuss with you

361
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:18,308
Don't let other people wait for us

362
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,868
Wait a moment

363
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:40,497
Are you Jackson?

364
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,989
About this...

365
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:50,607
Sorry for that

366
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:53,409
I call you so urgently

367
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:57,814
We can play until the shop open

368
00:34:57,814 --> 00:34:59,716
I don't have money

369
00:34:59,716 --> 00:35:01,718
It is not a problem

370
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:07,918
Of course I know you don't have money

371
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:10,527
Great

372
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,829
I win, I am lucky today

373
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,565
You are really great

374
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,867
I don't want to play anymore

375
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:21,237
You are good at this

376
00:35:21,237 --> 00:35:28,645
I only have talent in play Ma Jong

377
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:33,776
You are arrogant

378
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:53,670
Not bad

379
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,972
Smile more

380
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:59,075
Right, it is right

381
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:02,476
Are you nervous?

382
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:06,783
Give me a hand

383
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:08,774
I know

384
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,388
You are too slow

385
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:12,989
Sorry

386
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:14,624
Excuse me

387
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,925
To be more concentrated

388
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:19,095
Give more gesture

389
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,998
Cute

390
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:23,829
Not bad

391
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:28,204
She has high potential

392
00:36:28,204 --> 00:36:29,706
So you need to shoot well

393
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,207
Then, the sales will be great

394
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,609
I know

395
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,244
More gestures

396
00:36:35,244 --> 00:36:38,008
Smile more

397
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:44,153
Think of the guy you love

398
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:49,420
Yes, it is great

399
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:19,055
At the beginning, we will only be taking photos

400
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:21,958
Of course I will let you do the advertisement

401
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:24,594
And I know that there are many TV advertising

402
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:30,897
would like to employ new faces for them

403
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:34,563
How is it?

404
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:40,677
But...

405
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:44,613
What do you want?

406
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,785
Nothing

407
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,220
I will let you know later

408
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,989
A pretty girl like you

409
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:57,016
...is a pity to be with a guy like him

410
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:03,800
You boyfriend...

411
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,103
I think you'd better leave him

412
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:10,707
Why?

413
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,710
I investigated you before

414
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,511
I know your information very well

415
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,120
If you want became famous

416
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,926
Maybe you can help your 2 friends

417
00:38:29,926 --> 00:38:32,328
Really?

418
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,822
I am famous in the music field

419
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:49,645
Damn it

420
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:54,484
Your luck only visit you from the beginning

421
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:57,453
It is out of my imagination

422
00:38:57,453 --> 00:39:02,584
Your ability is only like this

423
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:11,701
You lost 16 points

424
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:14,771
That means you lost 16,000 yen

425
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,974
I don't have enough money

426
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:20,076
You are wrong

427
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:23,780
It is 1.6 million yen

428
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,117
Right

429
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:31,487
Are we playing that much?

430
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,189
Of course

431
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:37,593
This is a common sense

432
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:39,695
Right

433
00:39:39,695 --> 00:39:41,597
Jackson, what are you saying?

434
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:46,002
Pay the money now

435
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:47,403
Are you kidding me?

436
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:49,205
I ask you to pay now!

437
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:52,641
Do you hear me?

438
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:03,815
Yes, you lost the game, understand?

439
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,056
I have no money

440
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:11,527
Then, you have to work for us

441
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:17,366
And you can pay the money for us

442
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:24,033
I am helping you now

443
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:27,276
Sorry

444
00:40:27,276 --> 00:40:30,143
This is the way he works

445
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,055
Can't you sleep now?

446
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:50,592
Why are you awake?

447
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:53,860
I can't sleep

448
00:40:56,405 --> 00:41:01,104
Traves

449
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:07,706
What's the matter?

450
00:41:08,684 --> 00:41:12,085
I have something to discuss with you

451
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:18,116
Talk to me tomorrow

452
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,088
Sorry

453
00:42:10,646 --> 00:42:14,350
There are so many poor people

454
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,955
That's why we are so busy

455
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,356
Yes

456
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:24,850
It seems that you get used to this job already

457
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:32,868
She is a pretty girl

458
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:35,871
Very sexy

459
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:39,475
I am familiar with her

460
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:43,412
Who is she?

461
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:50,319
Isn't she the girl who was always with you?

462
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,587
Right?

463
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:55,992
She looks like her

464
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,393
Really?

465
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:58,894
I don't think so

466
00:42:58,894 --> 00:43:05,094
Yes, she is not as pretty as her

467
00:43:26,722 --> 00:43:32,718
I see, I will handle this

468
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,171
Are you tired?

469
00:43:45,474 --> 00:43:47,376
I am fine

470
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:49,745
You are so busy recently

471
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:52,048
You should be very tired

472
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:56,352
I would like to treat you a dinner tonight

473
00:43:56,352 --> 00:43:59,655
I am not available tonight

474
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:01,557
Fine

475
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:05,094
Sorry

476
00:44:05,094 --> 00:44:08,359
Forget it

477
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,666
Are you still living with him?

478
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:24,277
Are you going to marry him?

479
00:44:27,783 --> 00:44:32,588
He is working is a bad business

480
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:35,489
I know

481
00:44:36,792 --> 00:44:41,889
He is really as good as you think?

482
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:46,702
I understand your feeling

483
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:51,298
I am also a woman

484
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:55,611
You'd better beware of the paparazzo

485
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,444
Excuse me

486
00:44:58,547 --> 00:45:02,952
I want you to meet someone next time

487
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:07,423
He is a famous director

488
00:45:07,423 --> 00:45:11,160
You should come next time

489
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,856
I understand

490
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,854
I am watching TV now

491
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:46,659
I want to talk to you when we are eating

492
00:46:01,577 --> 00:46:05,080
Let's move out this house asap

493
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,782
Not bad

494
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:09,418
You go to find a property agency tomorrow

495
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,020
No, I can't

496
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,790
I have to get work tomorrow

497
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,325
Sorry

498
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:22,594
It will not be a big problem even if don't move out

499
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:35,144
I like to live here

500
00:46:35,144 --> 00:46:37,704
Really?

501
00:47:18,287 --> 00:47:21,848
What do you want to say?

502
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:25,156
I should know it

503
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:52,509
For the sake of her, please leave her

504
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:57,919
You want her to have good future, right?

505
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:02,630
You cannot give her happiness

506
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:14,408
I think you should know it

507
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:22,651
What do you want me to do?

508
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:29,557
She can be a super star

509
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,257
It will be a hard road to walk in the entertainment field

510
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:44,973
She works very hard

511
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:57,377
She will meet an very important person in the hotel

512
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:17,706
This is the road she choose

513
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:22,511
You should support her

514
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:27,972
Let's support her together

515
00:49:47,803 --> 00:49:50,704
Do you want to eat?

516
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,642
I don't eat this

517
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,511
You eat this

518
00:49:55,511 --> 00:49:57,146
Really?

519
00:49:57,146 --> 00:49:59,047
Yes, eat it

520
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:02,346
Thank you

521
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:12,628
I saw your performance

522
00:50:12,628 --> 00:50:23,436
It is great

523
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:40,345
It seems that you are not so happy

524
00:50:43,258 --> 00:50:46,795
What's up?

525
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,363
Are you unhappy?

526
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:52,768
No

527
00:50:52,768 --> 00:50:55,471
Don't lie to me

528
00:50:55,471 --> 00:50:59,271
No, I didn't

529
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:04,912
Understand

530
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:27,394
Can I see your hand?

531
00:51:33,642 --> 00:51:36,812
Your hand is not bad

532
00:51:36,812 --> 00:51:39,248
I believe you will have a happy life

533
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:40,148
Really?

534
00:51:40,148 --> 00:51:45,354
Just kidding

535
00:51:45,354 --> 00:51:52,226
You need to work hard for happiness

536
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:58,834
You should know it

537
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:02,326
About this...

538
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,743
Your manager had promised me

539
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:13,340
Stop it

540
00:52:17,486 --> 00:52:22,355
This is a job

541
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:38,771
What are you doing?

542
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:06,029
Are you alright?

543
00:53:09,204 --> 00:53:10,694
Stop it

544
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:22,207
You are not a kid anymore

545
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:40,726
It is no big deal to do this for money

546
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:48,170
Understand

547
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:52,279
Sorry

548
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,486
It is all my fault

549
00:53:57,486 --> 00:54:03,152
Sorry

550
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:23,204
Forget it

551
00:54:24,513 --> 00:54:30,418
You don't need to work for me anymore

552
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,623
Have you slept?

553
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:13,959
You should be hungry. I will cook for you

554
00:55:23,038 --> 00:55:25,734
Traves

555
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:34,783
I will go back to work in the marble game store

556
00:55:34,783 --> 00:55:40,050
That job is more suitable for me

557
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:43,046
Don't look at me like this

558
00:57:03,738 --> 00:57:06,764
Come on

559
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:07,755
Dead

560
00:59:08,496 --> 00:59:11,056
No way

561
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:20,870
You bought it to me when we are at hometown

562
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:28,083
You treat me very well when we were young

563
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:32,420
We were very happy

564
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:38,994
I remembered you bought it with 2,000 yen

565
00:59:38,994 --> 00:59:42,697
Though you only bought one

566
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:50,505
I feel very happy at that time

567
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,601
Really?

568
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:58,513
I remembered when we were young

569
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:03,818
I was crazy for making love with you

570
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:11,748
We always make love in the temple

571
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:25,340
I still remember that

572
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,537
Really?

573
01:00:30,445 --> 01:00:37,052
But I still feel happy with you

574
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:41,148
But I am not

575
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:57,705
We can't go on living like this

576
01:00:57,705 --> 01:01:00,674
Really?

577
01:01:03,778 --> 01:01:14,086
I am not happy with this kind of living

578
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,591
Really?

579
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:28,135
I want to leave

580
01:01:29,904 --> 01:01:33,908
Then I will leave

581
01:01:33,908 --> 01:01:42,111
It is my fault

582
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:22,049
Cherry

583
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,895
It is you

584
01:02:32,066 --> 01:02:35,170
Did you quarrel with Traves?

585
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:38,697
Peace to each other

586
01:02:39,874 --> 01:02:43,674
This time, it is different

587
01:02:52,487 --> 01:03:02,294
There is nothing left this time

588
01:03:08,636 --> 01:03:16,509
If you like here, you can stay

589
01:03:18,546 --> 01:03:21,344
Great

590
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:30,685
What are you doing here, movie star?

591
01:04:30,685 --> 01:04:32,186
I am a past tense star

592
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:35,089
I am just a common girl

593
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:38,388
I don't understand you

594
01:04:39,093 --> 01:04:42,397
Will you join the dating party today?

595
01:04:42,397 --> 01:04:46,334
All the guys there are rich

596
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:50,538
I heard that the Arabian oil king will come, too

597
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:53,508
This is really a great party

598
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:55,143
Cherry

599
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:58,408
I am finished

600
01:05:00,214 --> 01:05:03,251
Long time no see

601
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:05,119
Don't be like this

602
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,523
Welcome, you are back

603
01:05:08,523 --> 01:05:10,821
I am happy, too

604
01:05:49,063 --> 01:05:50,865
You handicraft is great

605
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:53,501
Try this

606
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:58,072
Don't be like this

607
01:05:58,072 --> 01:06:03,811
Enough

608
01:06:03,811 --> 01:06:05,313
Sorry

609
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:11,877
You are going too far

610
01:06:11,986 --> 01:06:16,791
Do we need to save some for Traves

611
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:19,885
Sorry

612
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:24,589
It's fine, I will make it

613
01:06:43,117 --> 01:06:45,153
Traves

614
01:06:45,153 --> 01:06:48,953
Thank you this time

615
01:06:56,964 --> 01:07:00,134
It is not hard to do

616
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:03,729
You can handle this on your own

617
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:13,444
Do a good job

618
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:39,067
I am not busy

619
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:51,210
You'd better hide the gun

620
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:24,618
Men like to be caressed like this

621
01:08:47,475 --> 01:08:50,244
Don't be too violent

622
01:08:50,244 --> 01:08:52,838
You will break my clothes

623
01:10:00,414 --> 01:10:04,817
Zon

624
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:09,349
Do you hear it?

625
01:10:16,263 --> 01:10:18,322
Look this way

626
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:27,533
I can't sleep as I am lonely

627
01:11:09,684 --> 01:11:12,585
No, we can't

628
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:15,084
Why?

629
01:11:17,124 --> 01:11:19,285
Because...

630
01:11:21,328 --> 01:11:28,200
I like you

631
01:11:54,962 --> 01:12:02,835
Touch my body

632
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:53,143
I said no already

633
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:04,883
It is my fault

634
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:08,753
Forget it

635
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,357
Sorry

636
01:14:47,101 --> 01:14:51,731
You are still the same

637
01:14:59,146 --> 01:15:03,105
Long time no see

638
01:15:08,856 --> 01:15:12,126
Your clothes are beautiful

639
01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:17,531
It costs about 200 thousand yen

640
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:20,034
I envy you

641
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:24,232
My clothes cost only 500 yen

642
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:27,641
Do you want me to introduce a job for you?

643
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:32,943
So you can afford these clothes by yourself

644
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,743
But I am afraid you won't do it

645
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:49,964
Do you play guitar as before?

646
01:15:49,964 --> 01:15:53,667
This is the only thing I know

647
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:56,971
So you better play hard

648
01:15:56,971 --> 01:16:00,168
No kidding

649
01:16:00,674 --> 01:16:06,203
I don't have that talent

650
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,083
Have you found a girlfriend?

651
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:12,586
I had put my information on an advertisement

652
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:14,722
But there was no answer

653
01:16:14,722 --> 01:16:19,887
No one is interested in me

654
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,297
You are so simple

655
01:16:23,297 --> 01:16:26,733
Right

656
01:16:27,634 --> 01:16:29,803
Tokyo is like this

657
01:16:29,803 --> 01:16:30,904
You are right

658
01:16:30,904 --> 01:16:35,136
Tokyo is like this

659
01:18:06,033 --> 01:18:11,405
This is the first time I write to you

660
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:14,708
After staying in Tokyo for one year

661
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:21,415
I can see your performance at last

662
01:18:21,415 --> 01:18:23,617
In fact,

663
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:28,622
I always envy you

664
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:34,862
To be a great musician is a gorgeous dream

665
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:39,333
I don't have any plan

666
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:43,871
But I discovered something recently

667
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:47,975
In fact, staying with Traves...

668
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:51,945
...is a very happy thing

669
01:18:51,945 --> 01:18:58,652
So my dream is to stay with you

670
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:04,992
No matter what are we doing

671
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:07,294
And

672
01:19:07,294 --> 01:19:12,900
I know that you quit your job

673
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,768
But it is fine

674
01:19:14,768 --> 01:19:19,273
As you are pursuing your dream

675
01:19:19,273 --> 01:19:24,978
I won't mind it

676
01:19:24,978 --> 01:19:29,415
I like you very much

677
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:41,451
Go away

678
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:27,698
No way

679
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:49,418
You can't keep it on like this

680
01:21:51,925 --> 01:21:57,261
See, you have lost a big deal

681
01:21:58,332 --> 01:22:01,358
No way

682
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:12,037
What should I do?

683
01:22:14,081 --> 01:22:16,572
What's up?

684
01:22:18,485 --> 01:22:21,386
What's up?

685
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:27,852
About this...

686
01:24:12,966 --> 01:24:15,764
Traves

687
01:24:29,082 --> 01:24:30,283
I am back

688
01:24:30,283 --> 01:24:31,318
Where have you been?

689
01:24:31,318 --> 01:24:34,387
I went to buy something in the supermarket

690
01:24:34,387 --> 01:24:37,288
I will cook something for you now
