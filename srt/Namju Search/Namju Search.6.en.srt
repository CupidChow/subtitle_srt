00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:07,040
Let's be friends until we have longer for a long time

(Joo) Oh, what's the laughter of excitement]

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,146
It's a really beautiful friendship

Juda

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,250
We too, huh?

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,951
Until my head is gray hair ...

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,220
- (Joo) Oh, what's it- (not) white, white hair ...

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,289
- (Joo) No, but I'm excited- (excitement) huh? huh?

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,124
(Joo) What are you going to do with those seniors?

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,160
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,797
No, because coincidence is interested in you

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,367
(Military) Can you be interested in you?

14
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,335
Is it black?

16
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,774
I think you're misunderstood.

17
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,843
(Excitement) Actually

18
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:47,080
The person I was looking for was my best friend.

19
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,083
Not a senior in Korea?

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,251
[Joo's happy elasticity]

21
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,219
(Military) Oh, then

22
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,055
So did you do well?

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,525
Hey, don't look like that

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,127
(Couple) You are so honest with your feelings

25
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,230
just

26
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,632
When I look at it, I feel better

27
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,635
What else

28
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:11,405
(Korea) I too

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,640
I feel good when I see a cat

30
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,045
I want to help you to adapt well

31
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,147
I also eat well and well

32
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,216
I want to help

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,017
What is that

34
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:25,986
Is that all?

35
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,423
How do you like that?

36
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,091
[Laughter]

37
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:32,893
Is it not?

38
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,262
(Coincidence) What are you?

39
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,165
You're not doing well to the excitement because of spring too

40
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,366
I'm not going to be?

41
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,936
I wish I weren't spring or you in the first place

42
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,372
(Korea) I couldn't get close to him

43
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,643
first

44
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,912
I need time to excitement

45
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,616
I will help you from the side

46
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:57,751

[theme song]

50
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,457
(Mina) I also agree with those people

51
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,358
Huh?

52
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,928
Seniors said they were good at thinking

53
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,062
Not selfish

54
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,965
Well, there is no reason for it

55
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,100
Why is there no reason?

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,368
Besides, the coincidence

57
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,238
I met you three times every year

58
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,674
Like fate

59
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,876
(Mina) And you too

60
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,945
I think you like coincidence

61
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,580
I did it before

62
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,949
I didn't know about Kali then

63
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,952
I like it now

64
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,058
Hey, and huh?

65
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,861
Shouldn't the student focus on studying?

66
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,896
(Excitement) I have to study, study

67
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,403
(Mina) Study?

68
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,905
When are you going to do it?

69
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,540
(Excitement) Now!

70
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,811
(Mina) Huh, yeah

71
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,913
For the time being, take a good center

72
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,882
You are now adult

73
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,717
I go

74
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,485
I study well

00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,954
[Mimic Mina] 'You are an adult now'

76
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,724
Did you see the test yesterday?

77
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,592
(Military) Oh, I barely saved

[Humor effective sound]

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,273
Why are you touching your hair?

81
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,741
I'll drink coffee well

82
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,342

83
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:06,480
Uh, I will see you well too, thank you

84
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,353
Self -life says this is selfish.

85
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,322
No

[Humor effective sound]

87
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,129
See the test well, fight

88
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,975
(Jua) Yes, this is called selfishness

89
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,809
huh

90
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,877
no

91
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,881
This is a consideration for juniors who can't adapt to school

[Joo's leaking laughter]

93
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,417

Oh, no, it's okay

It's your seat

104
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,516
If I'm uncomfortable, if you are doing this here

105
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,518
You really don't have to do it

106
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,287
(Student 1) Why are you so noisy?

107

I'm so sorry

113

(Excitement) You don't have to be considerate

114
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,506
