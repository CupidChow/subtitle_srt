1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,590
   

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,450
   

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,140
   

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,540
   

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,810
   

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
   

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,570
   

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,540
   

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,090
Your Highness, he has the sword.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,570
Please excuse my rudeness.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,010


12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,810
Do I have permission to strike this man?

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,990
Put away your sword.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,410
Did you not hear my order?

15
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,700
I clearly saw your face at my house in Gaeseong.

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,150
Seriously, this guy!

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,750
Your Highness.

18
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,590
What does he mean, Gaeseong?

19
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,070
Then... this guy is...

20
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,850
Until I call you again, go back and wait for me.

21
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,570
But, Your Highness, how could you let such an evil girl–

22
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,160
Did I not tell you to go and wait for me?

23
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,090
Do as I have commanded you.

24
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
    
 How could you act so hasty?  

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,590
Are you confusing your memories?

27
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,940
I am not confused. My memories are clear.

28
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,760
Your Highness, I have told you this before as well.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,610
It is clear that he killed the herald you sent on the way to my house.

30
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,070
He was also among the ones who spread the "Song Family Destroy Yi" red papers on the streets.

31
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,610
I definitely saw him, and I remember clearly.

32
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,210
I know because we ended up fighting while I was chasing him.

33
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,600
Even though he was wearing a mask, it was his face–

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,400
It were definitely his eyes, Your Highness.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,190
Think about it.

36
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,890
He is also the one who can move freely around the Eastern Palace.

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,010
The one who shot the arrow at you a year ago

38
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,480
 would have been possible because it was him. 

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,190
 Not only the Eastern Palace, but he can also freely enter the royal hunting grounds. 

40
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,530
 Not only that, 

41
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,710
 but the arrow that flew at you during the military training hunt must also be his. 

42
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,670
 Nobody would have thought that he was suspicious since he is someone who should be there. 

43
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,650
 He probably shot an arrow at you and then ran off. 

44
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,240
 Are not the arrows and quiver 

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,880
 the same ones used by military officers at the military training hunt? 

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,360
 Perhaps the one who delivered the amur viper and the dagger to the head shaman 

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
 was also him. 

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,250
 Soon, the door to the new world will open. Now, complete God's message. 

49
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,620
 The one who set fire to the plum tree was probably him too. 

50
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,590
He would have entered the prison where the head shaman was held

51
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,700
saying it was your orders, Your Highness.

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,400
Tomorrow, you should go to the prison of the Royal Investigation Bureau–

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,050
Did the officers guarding the prison of the Royal Investigation Bureau not already die?

54
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,430
Even if my memories are in a bad state because of the shock of losing my family,

55
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,940
I remember his face clearly.

56
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,400
It is impossible.

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,540
Please...

58
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,770
Please believe what I say, Your Highness.

59
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,950
On the day that your family was murdered,

60
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,980
Tae Kang was at the Eastern Palace all day.

61
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,660
Tae Kang is innocent.

62
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,470
I am proof of Tae Kang's innocence.

63
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,520
Gaeseong is more than a day's travel from here.

64
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,760
 To think that bastard was the murderer from Gaeseong, Min Jae Yi... 

65
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,440
 Since when did His Highness know about this? 

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,750
 His Highness knew ever since he first saw him at the military training hunt. 

67
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,460
 That his identity was not Jang Chi Soo, but he was Min Jae Yi. 

68
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,120
 The fact that he gave him the private room was because he was a woman. 

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
How could one person be in both Hanyang and Gaesong simultaneously?

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,330
There is no way...

71
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,690
Are you sure you are not mistaken?

72
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,370
Also, you may think that Tae Kang was among the ones who spread the red papers on the streets,

73
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,570
 but he was with me at that moment. 

74
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,250
If it is as you say, then do you mean that Tae Kang set fire to the oyat tree,

75
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,960
and then suddenly teleported to the streets?

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,110
But the face behind that mask was definitely the Guardian Warrior.

77
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,040
It was definitely his face!

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,880
I know very well that you tried hard to remember something from your confused memories.

79
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,900
However, Tae Kang is not the culprit.

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,970
First, calm yourself down, and take the day off tomorrow.

81
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,320
Also, try to think about it again.

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,750
This is an order.

83
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,340
Did you bring work to do again?

84
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,980
Does that pub pay well for your services?

85
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,830
It is pretty, right?

86
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,060
Gosh, how could they wear clothes like this every day?

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,980
I guess which family you are born into is really important.

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,050
If you want to wear it, try it on.

89
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,840
Forget it.

90
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,030
 Your Highness. Are you awake? 

91
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,020
Come in.

92
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,120
Your Highness, I do not see Eunuch Go.

93
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,670
Did you, by chance, give a separate order to Eunuch Go?

94
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,890
I gave Eunuch Go a special errand last night.

95
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,020
I see, Your Highness.

96
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,360
That is right. The Guardian Warrior stayed by His Highness' side that day.

97
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,190
His Highness had a royal education assessment that day,

98
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,170
so he was standing by his side, keeping watch.

99
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,050
Did he stay in the Eastern Palace after the royal education assessment was over?

100
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,720
After the royal education assessment was over, he stayed in the Eastern Palace with us.

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,430
But why do you ask about that day?

102
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,580
And about the Guardian Warrior in particular?

103
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,710
There was something I needed to look into.

104
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,010
Do not worry about it.

105
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,100
 Am I just mistaken about this? 

106
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,650
 No, there is no way my memories are wrong. 

107
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,640
Was I the herald to give Your Highness' wedding gifts to the governor of Gaeseong?

108
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,300
Was I the assassin who spread the red papers?

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,840
How could you trust and keep a girl who speaks such nonsense by your side?

110
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,240
She is a criminal on the run after killing her own family.

111
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,370
She is not a criminal. She is my master's daughter.

112
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,950
If people find out that you let such a wicked girl into the Eastern Palace as a eunuch,

113
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,690
how will you be safe?

114
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,650
Your Highness, it is not too late to oust that girl.

115
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,420
Did she not go through such terrible things?

116
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,560
Give her some time.

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,380
And what is the secret letter that she spoke of?

118
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,630
- Your Highness... 
 - It appears her memories are a bit confused.

119
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,870
Do not worry about it anymore.

120
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,930
Also, since I trust you, you need not be shaken.

121
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,910
Thus, look into the source of Park Han Soo's money.

122
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,440
Where did you go... by yourself?

123
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,410
I was not able to see the assassin's face properly.

124
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,330
He was wearing a mask.

125
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,790
No, Lady.

126
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,140
My master told me that he met the Guardian Warrior on the streets wearing a disguise.

127
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,500
That was probably because of His Highness' secret mission.

128
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,770
But what was more strange was that he acted like he had met my master for the first time.

129
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,340
But what happened to your memories?

130
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,660
Is it not strange that someone as bright as you would have

131
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,000
your memories messed up, even if you did receive a lot of shock?

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Apart from the Guardian Warrior's face, do you remember anything else?

133
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,240
On the day of that incident, there was an incense of peony petals in the corner of the kitchen.

134
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
Pardon?

135
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,770
The incense of peony petals was in our Gaeseong house as well?

136
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,110
How could something that was in the head shaman's place also be in our Gaeseong house?

137
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,630
That day,

138
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,060
I was tasting the soup in the kitchen when Young came.

139
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,190
Do you remember what you talked about?

140
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,900
He was probably sad that he would not see me anymore since I was going far away for marriage.

141
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,580
He grabbed my hand for a moment, too.

142
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,510
Pardon? Your hand, Lady?

143
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,930
Well, I guess it wasn't really my hand,

144
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,790
but he touched my bracelet.

145
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,420
Your bracelet-

146
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,200
Bracelet...

147
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,170
That bracelet that Young Master Shim Young gifted you that others are saying

148
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,300
was a token of love?

149
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,450
Ga Ram, did Young have white hair?

150
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,020
Have you ever seen him get white hair?

151
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,240
I have not.

152
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,270
Young Master is too young to get white hair.

153
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,570
The autopsy report for Young said he had white hair.

154
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,100
Pardon?

155
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,270
How could that be?

156
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,600
When you last saw the Young Master,

157
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,250
did he have white hair, Lady?

158
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,070
No. He did not have white hair.

159
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,360
He did not...

160
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,860
What has happened to me?

161
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,820
Why are my memories messed up?

162
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,870
Oh, no!

163
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,780
Did you wash it clean?

164
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,620
There were only ashes and flower petals inside.

165
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,990
Was it something valuable?

166
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,640
No.

167
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,740
Oh, the handsome scholar is here.

168
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,610
Gosh, Friend.

169
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,870
They washed this clean.

170
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,290
Gosh, how diligent they are...

171
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,120
How come you came here by yourself? What about the little handsome scholar?

172
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,490
Did he not come here by any chance?

173
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,410
Oh, the little handsome scholar...

174
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,770
He went all the way over there with my student.

175
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Are you really going to buy that?

176
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,300
I will get this one.

177
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,120
Oh, Scholar!

178
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

179
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,270
I am sorry, but we will buy this next time.

180
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,000
We will see you again next time.

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,980
Okay...

182
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,530
Pardon?

183
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,100
How do you know of a place like this?

184
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,400
It was my late Hyungnim's favorite place.

185
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,480
He would often bring me along here.

186
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,110
 What do you see? 

187
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,370
 Seeing how there is smoke coming from each house, are they not cooking right now? 

188
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,660
 Even the children out playing in fields know to go home 

189
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,810
 when they see the smoke coming from the chimneys. 

190
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,340
 Then, 

191
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
 what do you think about the child of that house? 

192
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,100
 Since no smoke rises from the chimney of that house, even when it is evening, 

193
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,050
 how would the child of that house know when to go home? 

194
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,270
 And even if he goes home, 

195
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,530
 would he not starve? 

196
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,000
My hyungnim would often come here

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,330
and look upon the people's houses

198
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,090
and the smoke from making meals rising from the chimneys.

199
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,160
Before he passed away, when there was a famine,

200
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,900
the number of houses with smoke rising from them decreased by half,

201
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,680
and he was heartbroken by it.

202
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,690
My hyungnim was like that.

203
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,780
He was someone who always thought about the people first.

204
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,030
So,

205
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,040
I looked forward to the Joseon that my hyungnim was going to bring about.

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,730
I did not know that he would

207
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,260
get sick and die so easily like that.

208
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,460
Have you ever come back here since then?

209
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,160
I did not want to come,

210
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,610
nor was I able to.

211
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,470
It was hard for me to accept that my hyungnim had passed away,

212
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,360
and I did not want to hear the evil rumors about how I killed my hyungnim by giving him a peach.

213
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,680
Most of all,

214
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,420
I did not like that I became the Crown Prince.

215
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,090
I was not confident I could be greater than my hyungnim.

216
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,150
And despite all that,

217
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,200
here I am.

218
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,440
It is because you came to me

219
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
that I was able to come here.

220
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,790
It is because you came to me

221
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,540
that I gained the strength to fight against my fate.

222
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,010
Thanks to you,

223
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,970
I was able to come out to the world and meet people.

224
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,540
I realized that they are also my people that I need to protect.

225
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,280
I will protect them.

226
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,210
My people.

227
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,940
Also,

228
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,320
I will bring it about...

229
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,240
the Joseon that my hyungnim had envisioned.

230
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,010
With you.

231
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,870
So, you should also

232
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,230
lean against me if you are having a hard time.

233
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,940
Lean on me. I will gladly

234
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,240
protect you with all my strength.

235
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,790
Yes, Your Highness.

236
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:12,010
♫  Only when I swallowed sadness, please remember  ♫

237
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,730
Do you remember this dagger?

238
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,930
You had it with you when you came to me.

239
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,200
 I do not carry it around to attack anyone. 

240
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,380
 It is just a dagger I keep on me to protect myself. 

241
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,070
At that time, you said you did not carry this dagger to harm anyone.

242
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,540
You said that you kept it on you to protect yourself.

243
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,760
I will return this to you,

244
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,710
so make sure...

245
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,370
to use it to protect yourself.

246
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,590
You are so pathetic, seriously.

247
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,500
Were you hiding and spying on me to see what I was doing?

248
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,660
Mind your own business. I am using my eyes to see.

249
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,460
Why are you hiding while watching me? That is so annoying!

250
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,100
Of course, I would watch a suspicious bad guy in hiding, not blatantly!

251
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,590
Why did you come here? Did you come to spy on me?

252
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,500
Since you do not like books, you probably did not come here to read His Highness' books.

253
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,870
The Analects. Where is it?

254
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,840
Even though I may be busy because of His Highness' orders,

255
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,520
quarterly evaluations are coming up soon, so should I not study?

256
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,190
Is the Analects all you need?

257
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,080
The Analects, Great Learning, and Mencius.

258
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,980
You should have been studying all along. I'll find them for you.

259
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,440
Where those books are...

260
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,990
The Analects, Mencius,

261
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,070
- and Great Learning. 
 - How dare you use your foot to—

262
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,770
It is a waste to use my hands for you.

263
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,260
Good luck finding those books.

264
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,140
That little...

265
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,240
Did she forget she is a girl?

266
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,070
I am not the culprit.

267
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,650
What can I do about my face being in your memories?

268
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,590
Just like you have no way to prove your innocence,

269
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,010
it is the same with me.

270
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,090
If you really did not kill your family, you also must feel it is unfair.

271
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,850
I also...

272
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,780
feel it is unfair that my face is in your memories.

273
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,890
I am not the culprit.

274
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,210
It is that child from that time.

275
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,430
Did you come to eat?

276
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,250
I was sorry about that day for calling you a thief.

277
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,030
Had I known you had stolen some food, I would not have chased you so scarily.

278
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,000
What took you so long to come here?

279
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,010
What did you eat during that time...

280
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,740
Come inside.

281
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,030
It is okay, so you should hurry up and come inside.

282
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,620
Oh my, Lady.

283
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,420
Did any valuable items come in?

284
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,140
Yes. I have just the thing you might like.

285
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,940
You should come inside and check it out.

286
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,610
Woodpecker.

287
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,110
I will properly flatten your proud nose.

288
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,900
Wait, that woman...

289
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,810
T-The woodpecker is back!

290
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,860
Where did he go?

291
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,550
What the...

292
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,270
Is he running away thinking that I am the woodpecker?

293
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,970
Myung Jin, you are not running away right now.

294
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,640
All you are doing right now is strengthening your legs.

295
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,190
Gosh, there is a chicken right here as well.

296
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,540
This rooster is quite large!

297
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,030
Oh! Sister,

298
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,140
it is that man from back then. The one who helped us!

299
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,580
Oh, are you not the children from back then?

300
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,490
Why are you squatting there awkwardly like that?

301
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,610
Don't worry about me. I was in the middle of doing something important.

302
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,570
So, are you enjoying your food?

303
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,400
They are already on their third bowl!

304
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,560
Three bowls already?

305
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,240
Go ahead and eat some more!

306
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,490
Aigoo, you are eating so well.

307
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,390
Just from the look of it, it is clear this is a precious imported item.

308
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,800
Yes, so it is quite expensive, Lady.

309
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,590
I set it apart just so I could give it to you, Lady.

310
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,690
Money is not an issue for me.

311
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,940
By chance, are you not the third daughter of the Minister of General Affairs?

312
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,910
Do you know me?

313
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:02,840
I heard the news that you were in marriage talks with Young Master Kim Myung Jin.

314
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,260
Marriage talks? How could you link me to that weird man?

315
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,800
I have been watching him for a long time.

316
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,720
He is such an incredible man.

317
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,890
I revered him so much that I could not even initiate a conversation with him.

318
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,510
But I heard that he was in marriage talks with you, Lady,

319
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,490
so I dared to speak out of line.

320
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,780
He is not someone who can be connected to an ordinary family.

321
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,650
Ordinary? How could you say that my family...

322
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,590
is ordinary?

323
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,200
Of which family are you the maiden daughter?

324
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,820
He is someone who will become great, even if he does not desire it.

325
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,330
How will he become great? All he does is inspect dead bodies...

326
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,460
Young Master does not discriminate between what is valuable or lowly,

327
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,290
and has a unique ability to observe everything in the world.

328
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,180
In the future, age will come when scholars like the Young Master

329
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,480
who study truth from nature are revered.

330
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,470
Until that day comes, I wish to support the Young Master by his side.

331
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,850
So, please give up

332
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,620
on my young master.

333
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,720
I understand how you feel,

334
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,250
but marriage is a matter between our families, so I cannot do whatever I want.

335
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,620
I beg you desperately, Lady.

336
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,060
My Lady!

337
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,150
Lady! Are you all right?

338
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,980
Gosh, seriously. This precious thing could have been damaged!

339
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,460
How could you be so unmannerly?

340
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,280
Just my bad luck...

341
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,970
Let us go.

342
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,510
How old are you this year?

343
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,490
I am 15, and my younger brother is 11.

344
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,440
What about your names?

345
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,170
Gosh, now that I think about it, I have not even asked you guys your names.

346
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,440
What are your names?

347
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,950
It is Dal Rae and Meo Roo.

348
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,380
Gosh, are your hands weak because you spent all night sewing?

349
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,510
Whoa, whoa. It is okay, I got it.

350
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,550
Are you not hurt?

351
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,170
Yes, yes, it is all right.

352
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,130
You said your names are Dal Rae and Meo Roo?

353
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,500
Yes, I am Dal Rae, and he is Meo Roo.

354
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,080
Those are pretty names.

355
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,710
Good thing you managed to remember your younger brother's name.

356
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,450
I heard that you had to flee from Byeokcheon.

357
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,900
You must have been only about five years old then.

358
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,890
I told you not to talk about Byeokcheon to others!

359
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,590
Oh, those two people are okay.

360
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,300
They are the kindest and most generous people in this neighborhood,

361
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,650
so you do not need to worry.

362
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,670
I will guarantee that.

363
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,430
It was definitely My Lady's bracelet.

364
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,120
 Come to me! 
 (T/N: This means "come and open the door.") 

365
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,360
Oh, my student!

366
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,380
How could you come without making a sound?

367
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,730
What were you doing that you are so taken aback?

368
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,470
I was getting dressed... Do not come here!

369
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,900
I am not finished getting dressed. S-S-Something dirty got on my clothes,

370
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,370
so I took it off to shake it off.

371
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,170
We are both men, so why are you so secretive!

372
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,980
Gosh, what are you doing, Master!

373
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,290
Those children came to the tavern.

374
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,340
Yes, I see.

375
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,810
The Byeokcheon kids.

376
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,470
Pardon? Those children came to eat?

377
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,750
Their names are supposedly Meo Roo and Dal Rae.

378
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,200
I will go and see them, too.

379
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,910
No, no, no. They left. They are not there anymore.

380
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,970
I wanted to see their faces...

381
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,160
They ate four bowls of rice each, and yet they left wanting a bit more.

382
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,420
They will come back again, so you should see them then.

383
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,860
Okay.

384
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,830
Sir!

385
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,660
- What is the matter? 
 - The military official chasing the Department of Taoism official

386
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,510
who defiled the celebratory message returned.

387
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,900
Did he find out the whereabouts of Oh Man Shik?

388
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,180
He changed his name and lived near Imjinnaru in Paju, running a fabric store.

389
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,400
I will set off early tomorrow morning along with military officials.

390
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,590
I will go with you in disguise.

391
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,300
If you gather up military officials to go with you, then the word will get out,

392
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,880
and he might relocate to another location.

393
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,340
Since he is from Byeokcheon, he may have something to do with the head shaman.

394
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,820
Thus, we must ensure that he lives.

395
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,840
I will come as well.

396
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,650
Then,

397
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,790
will Tae Kang come with us as well?

398
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,140
I will accompany you.

399
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,080
Kang will not be necessary.

400
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,030
It would be enough to just have you there.

401
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,120
Of course, Your Highness.

402
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,170
Did you find it?

403
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,910
I assigned someone to the Ministry of Defense official.

404
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,220
You are finally paying for your daughter's medicine.

405
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:01,520
If I knew he was from Byeokcheon, I would not have used him.

406
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,260
There is no choice. There will have to be blood.

407
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,870
Hurry up before Sergeant arrives.

408
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:17,560
Before he mentions my name, we have to get rid of him.

409
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,070
If so, what should I do with Sergeant?

410
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,470
If we are lucky, we could get rid of the son of the Han family of Youngsan, too.

411
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,760
There cannot be any trace.

412
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,940
Come have a look!

413
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,120
Come here and have a look!

414
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,920
Come have a look!

415
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,540
Please come again!

416
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,380
Come have a look!

417
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Yes, this one looks more profitable.

418
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,300
Why do you not say anything? Is this better for clothing?

419
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,060
Oh my, goodness!

420
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,910
Stop.

421
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,330
I am not here to kill you.

422
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,350
I know that you are from Byeokcheon.

423
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,240
What more do you need to ask, then?

424
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,930
You can just butcher me as you did then!

425
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,030
I would like to know what happened 10 years ago.

426
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,740
Do you want to know what happened then now?

427
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,830
It wreaked blood everywhere.

428
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:54,690
My father died, mother died, son died, and my daughter died!

429
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,240
Because of your father's order!

430
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,330
None of them was a bandit.

431
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,690
All of them were...

432
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,240
No!

433
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,100
No! No!

434
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,360
Your Highness, are you hurt?

435
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,570
Watch out!

436
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,630
Spread out!

437
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,960
Were the assassins targeting Oh Man Shik?

438
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,170
I think they noticed that I was after him.

439
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,080
Are you two okay?

440
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,900
One of the five assassins died. There are four left now.

441
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,990
They must have run deep into the mountain.

442
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,830
One of them has an injured arm. We can catch them.

443
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,350
Let us go.

444
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,620
Eunuch Go!

445
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,330
Let us go.

446
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,140
This is water from the Department of Taoism.

447
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,070
This is the water we got from the Department of Taoism.

448
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,610
Blood...

449
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,830
If that bastard was from Byeokcheon,

450
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,530
did he have another reason to come to me?

451
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,390
What will you do with that?

452
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,600
If there is blood on the celebratory message, it would be considered a sign of misfortune.

453
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,270
There is a rumor about the Crown Prince being cursed by a ghost as well.

454
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,040
Why do you wish to inflate that rumor even more?

455
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,400
Since you are the maternal great-uncle of Grand Prince Myung Ahn—

456
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,560
That is right.

457
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,330
It would be good for me if the Crown Prince lost the people's faith.

458
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,220
What is your name?

459
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,600
I am Oh Man Shik.

460
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,170
The Crown Prince is not a fool.

461
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,370
You have to hide away as soon as the work is done.

462
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:40,530
Even if you get caught, if you do not mention my name,

463
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,570
I will protect your family for you.

464
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,810
Did he really come for my benefit?

465
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Whether he came for me or another reason,

466
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,010
he is bound to die anyway.

467
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,940
It looks like many people will die today just because of that one Crown Prince.

468
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,020
Soon Dol.

469
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,870
Seong On.

470
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,710
Go Soon Dol!

471
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,890
Han Seong On!

472
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,970
Can you not hear my voice?

473
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,740
Answer me!

474
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,820
Han Seong On!

475
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,290
Go Soon Dol!

476
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,850
 "Many will be killed as a result of your foolishness." 

477
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,780
Why did you bring these to my room?

478
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,170
Her Ladyship ordered you to stay put inside your room.

479
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,630
- Why? 
 - He is expecting an important guest.

480
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,820
He told all the servants to eat dinner early and not come outside today.

481
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,290
An important guest? Is he not on his break today?

482
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,170
   

483
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,230
Who is Father attending to himself anyway?

484
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,290
I told you to stay inside your room today!

485
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,810
Why are you out here then, Mother?

486
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,740
You should wait out here.

487
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

488
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,550
Ouch...

489
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,850
Who is it?

490
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,380
One of them is the Left State Minister... and the other one is...

491
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,610
How would I know?

492
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:18,410
He has been informing the slaves since a few days ago.

493
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,890
It must be someone important.

494
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:24,250
Come on, My Ladyship! You are such a bad liar.

495
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,370
I can tell right away from your face.

496
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,930
It is the King, is it not?

497
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,400
Be quiet! Father's fate might be at stake!

498
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,440
Is it really the King? If so, that person is...

499
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,130
H-His Majesty?

500
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,400
Go to your room now!

501
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,170
I was going to go that way!

502
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,860
I came because I needed to talk to you in secret.

503
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:03,190
What I will be telling you here today... cannot leave this room.

504
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,760
I will get the Crown Prince married quickly.

505
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,610
I can no longer stand the Jo family of Seongju's arrogance.

506
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,910
We think so as well.

507
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,630
However, in our families,

508
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,540
there is no young woman who qualifies for the selection.

509
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,650
- We do not know what to do. 
 - Han Joong Seop.

510
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:26,600
He has a daughter.

511
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,120
When I asked for your recommendation for the inspector general,

512
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,480
you recommended him because of his intelligence.

513
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,060
But a person from the Jo family

514
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,710
of Seongju ended up taking that position.

515
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

516
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,430
Han Joong Seop is a distant relative of mine.

517
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,760
He is a kind man who never hurt anyone in his life.

518
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,900
Since he stayed in the countryside without ever moving to the capital,

519
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,190
he does not know a lot about the politics in the palace,

520
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,700
but the Chief State Minister and Left State Minister can help him with that.

521
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,530
However, Your Majesty, coming from a good family is not the only requirement for entering the selection.

522
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,630
Not only she comes from a good family, but she also has to be virtuous.

523
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:11,650
She needs to have both parents, and her fortune reading has to be compatible with the one of the Crown Prince.

524
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,160
Only the woman who meets all of those conditions

525
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,750
is qualified to become His Highness' wife.

526
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,740
Also, even if we make Han Joon Seop's daughter enter the selection,

527
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:28,840
how do we know if the Jo family of Seongju will have a woman who is wiser and more qualified

528
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,360
without any fault?

529
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,530
Make sure the conditions are met.

530
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,780
Your Majesty.

531
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,680
What you mean is—

532
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,270
The princess consort has to come from the Han family of Yeongsan.

533
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:50,590
I cannot allow the Jo family of Seongju to become my in-law.

534
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,320
This is the Crown Prince's fortune reading.

535
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,040
Change the daughter of Han Joong Seop's fortune so it is compatible with this.

536
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,480
However, Your Majesty, this is a major event on which the country's well-being depends.

537
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,580
Why do you want to use falsity?

538
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,970
That would be deceiving the court and the nation.

539
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,730
Not only the Left Minister's family but also the Han family of Yeongsan can be destroyed.

540
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,330
Why do you try to burden the Left Minister this way?

541
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,260
How could I... worry about my own family?

542
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,580
If that is what you wish,

543
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,370
I will have to follow through.

544
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,410
Your Majesty.

545
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,910
I will follow your order.

546
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:52,600
Your Majesty, that is...

547
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,560
the milbu* with your stamp engraved on it.
(A badge to approve a military action)

548
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,940
   

549
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,730
Your Majesty.

550
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,780
Why are you giving this to me—

551
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,920
If something happens to me,

552
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,680
I want you to deliver half of this badge... to the Left State Minister

553
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,950
with this secret order.

554
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,500
Your Majesty, you cannot do this.

555
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,980
This solely lies within the power of the king.

556
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,100
It is a tremendous authority that another cannot apply.

557
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,720
Since our nation was founded, it has never been given to an official.

558
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,420
Your Majesty, if the legality of your order were to be questioned based on this,

559
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:50,420
who would dare esteem the throne and how could we rectify the affairs of the state?

560
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,760
Please listen to our plea, Your Majesty.

561
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,400
I do understand your concern.

562
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:02,260
The annals will depict me as the king who broke the rule.

563
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,030
How could I have no fear?

564
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,300
But this secret order should be...

565
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,030
considered as my will.

566
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,810
When I can no longer protect the Crown Prince—

567
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:18,330
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty! 

568
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,480
How could you say something so horrific?

569
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,400
If the day comes,

570
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,620
I am giving you the authority to take military action.

571
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,920
Use the five military camps

572
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,770
and make sure to protect the Crown Prince.

573
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,420
I trust you two.

574
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,710
I believe you two

575
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,640
could protect the Crown Prince.

576
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,710
Servant Han Joong Eon will follow your order and make sure

577
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:07,820
to protect the Crown Prince and strengthen the court and the nation.

578
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:23,200
Your Majesty. I will also do my best and remain loyal.

579
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,460
Eunuch Go! Eunuch Go!

580
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,460
Eunuch Go!

581
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,650
Are you all right?

582
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,310
His Highness... Where is His Highness?

583
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:16,410
Your Highness!

584
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,860
Your Highness! Can you hear me?

585
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,140
Your Highness!

586
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,720
Is your injured leg okay?

587
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,340
We need to find His Highness.

588
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,180
Your Highness!

589
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,420
- Go back down without me. 
 - I cannot.

590
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,290
I will not go back down until we find His Highness.

591
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,980
I will make sure to find him.

592
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,750
So you should go back to the market.

593
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,370
You injured your leg.

594
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,710
I cannot do that.

595
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,780
- Until I make sure he is safe— 
 - Eunuch Go!

596
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,400
Do you still not understand him?

597
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,810
He would not have been killed by them that easily.

598
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,000
There were many assassins.

599
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,140
It could not have been easy to fight them alone.

600
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:10,450
Sergeant, His Highness could not have been killed by them, could he?

601
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,660
Watch what you say.

602
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,980
He should be okay.

603
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,490
He needs to be okay.

604
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,980
He has to be alive.

605
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,740
 If I face difficulties, would it break your heart? 

606
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,470
 How could it not? 

607
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,160
 If you face difficulties because of me, 

608
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,630
 I will die from the pain of heartbreak. 

609
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,690
 Do you know where the word "heartbreak" comes from? 

610
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,340
 Mother monkey lost her baby 

611
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,150
 and died from grief because her intestines were cut off. 

612
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,250
 How sad must she have been for her intestines to be cut off? 

613
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,710
 Yes. 

614
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:04,850
 The grief that comes from losing someone precious must be as painful as that. 

615
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:15,010
 If something bad happens to you, I will end up that way. 

616
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,320
 I will also be the same. 

617
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,080
 Thus, I can protect you, and you can protect me. 

618
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,640
 We must make sure to be safe for each other's sake. 

619
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,560
 You cannot be in danger. 

620
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:45,240
If something bad happens to you, I cannot live.

621
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,300
No.

622
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,930
Sir.

623
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,210
His Highness must be safe.

624
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,670
Just as you said, I am sure he is alive.

625
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:08,670
He promised me... that I will protect him, and he will protect me.

626
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,020
We have to be safe for each other's sake.

627
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,200
Your Highness! Your Highness!

628
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,090
 I need to tell you something, Your Highness. 

629
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:31,320
 I have never forgotten that you are a woman. 

630
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,610
 I was happy then. 

631
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,960
 Because you did not forget that I am a woman. 

632
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,740
 You would become the King, and I would become a head eunuch. 

633
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,600
 Who said you would become the head eunuch? 

634
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,630
 That was just an excuse. 

635
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:50,570
 I just made an excuse because I wanted to be with you for a long time. 

636
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:55,140
 You have to be safe. I have something to tell you. 

637
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,920
 So you must... be alive for me. 

638
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,440
It will get dark soon. It might get even more dangerous.

639
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,720
His Highness would be in danger, too.

640
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,580
We need to find him and go back down with him.

641
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,370
 You live where the sun rises. Is that not so cool? 

642
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:31,740
 I'm the owner of the Eastern Palace, where the sun rises. 

643
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,880
The sun moved a lot in that direction. That must be West.

644
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,480
If so...

645
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,330
East is...

646
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,960
Where are you going? That is not the way down.

647
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,510
If...

648
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:52,520
If His Highness is safe and he is waiting for us,

649
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,170
- he must be on the East side. 
 - What are you talking about?

650
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:58,890
Where the sun rises. He is on the East side!

651
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,830
I know it!

652
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,500
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

653
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,880
Your Highness...

654
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,720
 Will you become my friend? 

655
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,830
 I have never stopped being your friend, Your Highness. 

656
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:21,120
 The fact that I can do something for you makes me so happy. 

657
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,170
 I will be by your side, Your Highness. 

658
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,760
 If those two died, I am to blame. 

659
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,230
 It is because of my cursed destiny. 

660
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,260
 Please... 

661
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,950
 Please be alive. 

662
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,700
 Please come back alive and prove that 

663
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:45,950
 the curse I got is merely a piece of paper. 

664
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,760
Your Highness!

665
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,230
Your Highness! Your Highness...

666
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:04,240
♫  Your voice is steeped in pain  ♫

667
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,920
♫  The words you swallowed  ♫

668
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,360
Your Highness!

669
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,040
♫  The world has coldly...  ♫

670
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,560
Your Highness!

671
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,800
Your Highness, I am sorry!

672
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,100
Please open your eyes!

673
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,710
No! Your Highness...

674
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,520
No, Your Highness!

675
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:39,810


676
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:46,670
♫  Only when I swallowed sadness  ♫

677
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:52,580
♫  Please remember  ♫

678
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:57,160
♫  That I am also...  ♫

679
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,760
   

680
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,060
 Get out of the way! 

681
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,960
 Is no one here? A person is dying! 

682
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,190
 Did you think I would not know you are from Byeokcheon? 

683
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,410
 Who are you? 

684
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,210
 Tell me everything you know about the Crown Prince. 

685
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,440
 Did Guardian Warrior order you to get rid of me? 

686
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,780
 It is all my fault. 

687
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,350
 I should not have insisted that I would stay by your side. 

688
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,710
 Please wake up and listen to me! 

689
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:25,220
 Jae Yi. I can no longer see you getting close to danger. 

690
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:28,330
 I will have to let you go.
