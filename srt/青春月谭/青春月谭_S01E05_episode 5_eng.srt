1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,910
   

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,580
   

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,090
   

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,970
   

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,800
   

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,500
   

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,470
   

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,700
   

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,180
   

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,910
The wanted poster for the third murder is up.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,600
Gosh, Master!

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,400
Geez, how could you rip this off?

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,480
Do not be shocked.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
You're the only one to get shocked by me doing this in this neighborhood.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,540
Gosh, why did he pet my head...?

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,190
What are you doing not following behind me?

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,630
Did you just give me a stink eye so cutely?

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,410
I did not!

19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,820
How could you call a man cute?! Do not say such things!

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,170
I will say you're cute because you are. What else would I say?

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,720
Then shall I...

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,270
say you have no ears? 
  (T/N: Phrase sounds similar to "cute") 

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,200
Geez! Gosh!

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,040
Why would you say such a corny dad joke?

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,340
So boring.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,490
Gosh, so cute.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,200
Is anyone home?

28
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,900
Goodness. Did you get upset because of that?

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,270
When I came, it was broken.

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,290
- Oh, Eunuch Go! 
 - When did you arrive?

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,400
I called from the yard, but there was no reply,

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,330
so I came in thinking you may be inside.

33
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,540
I was curious before, but I never got to ask you.

34
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,350
Why do you think that criminal

35
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,380
is the detective instead of her older brother?

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,900
The first case that Min Yoon Jae supposedly solved five years ago...

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,530
there was no way he could have solved it.

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,890
He had passed the humanities exam and was serving as an editor in the Dept. of Archives.

39
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,680
So how could he have solved a case in Gaeseong?

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,010
Thus, the following cases were also not solved by Min Yoon Jae.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,480
My wish is to meet Maiden Min Jae Yi

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,940
and solve all sorts of cases throughout the land.

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,980
They say she died!

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,250
Please give up on your obsession!

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,980
She definitely did not die.

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,340
I can guarantee you that she is somewhere alive.

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,080
She is absolutely dead.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,590
She is absolutely not dead!

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,000
- Seriously, why are you being like this? 
 - "Why are you being like this"?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,210
I...

51
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,170
may not be the maiden you are in love with,

52
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,690
but I can fulfill your desire to investigate cases together.

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,300
I know why you visited me, Eunuch Go.

54
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,300
Look at this. He took down wanted posters again!

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,690
You will end up in big trouble if you act like this!

56
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,160
If you wish to go to jail, I will escort you there, so let us go.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,990
Was it a wanted poster for the Sabangahn case?

58
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:37,670
I heard that the Sergeant called the three murders the Sabangahn case.

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,440
The Sergeant believes that there will be a fourth murder.

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,400
I also think that as well.

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,020
- My thoughts are likewise. 
 - According to the lucky dates,

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,660
the fourth murder will take place in four days.

63
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
Before that, we need to investigate again the second victim's body

64
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,860
to see if any character has been carved on it and prevent crime.

65
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,140
Are you not the best in this field in Joseon?

66
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,350
Gosh, I know exactly what you're thinking.

67
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,450
You are saying you need that, right?

68
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,160
You are right. I need that.

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,100
- What is that? 
 - Well, we will need to prepare.

70
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,120
You probably know this already.

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,240
I will put my faith in you, Young Master.

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,470
What are you trying to do?

73
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,070
We will...

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,040
 - Dig up a grave.  
 - Excuse me?

75
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,460
Digging up a grave?

76
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,550
What will you do after digging up a grave?

77
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,860
- We need to take out the dead body. 
 - Listen to you!

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,010
I am so happy I have met someone who speaks my language!

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,870
I-I cannot do this.

80
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,420
Sir.

81
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,230
As you have commanded, I looked through the census for the East side

82
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,000
I gathered a list of the seniors who are in a similar age group as the victims.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,090
- Did you notify the Left Police Bureau? 
 - Yes.

84
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,330
The soldiers will soon join us, and we will start the patrols.

85
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,270
All right.

86
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,250
The young master of Manyeondang already predicted that I would come.

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,030
- How was he? 
 - He doesn't stand out visibly,

88
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,100
but he seemed to be an extraordinary genius.

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,400
His new student is also pretty useful.

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,010
He appeared to be quick to act and quick to pick up on things.

91
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,940
Have you ever seen the young master, Your Highness?

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,340
I recognized his talent from just hearing stories about him.

93
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,760
He seemed reliable, so I sent him the arrow that I was hit by through Tae Kang a year ago.

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,400
He recognized that it was from me with just one look.

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,500
We will dig up and perform the autopsy of the second victim's body tomorrow around sunset.

96
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,080
I will send one more person there tomorrow.

97
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,070
One more person?

98
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,510
Who is he?

99
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,160
How shall I describe him in a way that does him justice?

100
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,990
Scholar Park of Namsan Village?

101
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,700
The sun will be setting soon, so why is he still not here?

102
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,850
What kind of man did he say he was?

103
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,810
You will know as soon as you see him.

104
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,550
Since he stands out wherever he goes.

105
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,490
He's tall and...

106
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,030
so handsome that people will turn to get a second glimpse.

107
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,850
He said that his face was radiant.

108
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,690
Why do we need someone handsome to dig up and perform an autopsy?

109
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,450
I also hate scholars who do not do any work trusting their good looks.

110
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,300
Did he not talk of any strengths?

111
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,800
He is capable in both academics and military arts as he is handsome.

112
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,480
He excels in everything he does.

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,770
He is the top talent in Joseon.

114
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,710
Shall I say that he is the most perfect man under heaven?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,700
He said he would be of big help to the investigation.

116
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
He must be an amazing person.

117
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,930
I mean, how amazing is he

118
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,200
that he is not here when it's way past our meeting time?

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,340
Is it by chance that person...

120
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,410
- He has to be Scholar Park. 
 - He is definitely Scholar Park.

121
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,670
His face really is radiant...

122
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,590
I can see he is Scholar Park even from far away.

123
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,690
I can tell he is Scholar Park even with my eyes closed!

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,730
It is nice to meet you, Scholar Park.

125
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,680
I am Kim Myung Jin, the owner of Manyeondang, where I research all of creation.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,710
I have heard much about you.

127
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,050
Did stories about me spread all the way to Namsan Village?

128
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,830
Gosh, what shall I do about my increasing fame!

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,380
By chance,

130
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,840
is there anyone else with you?

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,140
- Did you really come by yourself? 
 - Gosh, Eunuch Go!

132
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,850
You can tell at a glance that he is Scholar Park.

133
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,060
Yeah. He looks exactly like how His Highness described him.

134
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,940
I am Master Myung Jin's student.

135
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,360
It is nice to meet you.

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,880
Then you must be Eunuch Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace.

137
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,760
It is nice to meet you, Eunuch Go.

138
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,380
I am Scholar Park of Namsan Village.

139
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,660
Oh. I see.

140
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,600
I am Eunuch Go Soon Dol.

141
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,060
   

142
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,580
   

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,520
What do you mean His Highness is not here?

144
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,300
We just heard that he did not attend today's royal lecture, either.

145
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,040
He said that he was reading in the library.

146
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,760
Once he goes into the library, he usually locks the door and stays up all night,

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,410
so he commanded us not to follow him.

148
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,890
Is Eunuch Go not here as well?

149
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,400
He went to the library escorting His Highness...

150
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,140
His Highness took him, saying he needed him for the Sabangahn case.

151
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,680
He seems to be pretty concerned because of that case,

152
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,700
so please take extra care.

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,430
How could we do otherwise, Your Highness.

154
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,960
So annoying!

155
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,130
Even the Queen knows Go Soon Dol?

156
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,000
You had no relatives and lived alone. We will resolve the injustice you feel

157
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,200
for your untimely death.

158
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,150
So, be patient for just a bit longer.

159
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,800
What are you doing?

160
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,280
Start digging.

161
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,600
I poured the wine so we should start exhuming the body.

162
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
- Me? 
 - Obviously.

163
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,090
Should the master dig up the grave when he has a student?

164
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,810
I mean...

165
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,550
Gosh, seriously!

166
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,020
The master I used to serve before was very different from you, Master!

167
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,760
Instead of making me do all the hard work as a student, he partook in everything with me.

168
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,940
I had a lot to learn from him.

169
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,610
If you serve ten masters, you will learn ten things.

170
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,290
Stop talking and use your energy to start digging.

171
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,700
Then for the other shovel...

172
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,030
But...

173
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,670
how come you did not bring a servant or a student...

174
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,980
What, you do not have any?

175
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,280
Oh! Are you going to do it yourself?

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,180
- Do it myself? 
 - Yes!

177
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,510
Why do you look at me?

178
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,180
I have never handled anything like this.

179
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,570
This is not "this" but a shovel.

180
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,570
I know that! You think I do not know what a shovel is?

181
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,680
Are you saying you have never used a shovel before?

182
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,110
Quickly pick up a shovel and start digging.

183
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,050
There's no one else but you, Scholar Park.

184
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,190
I will have a lot of work to do after the body is exhumed.

185
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,000
And that person is from the palace.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,630
He is an esteemed person who serves in close proximity to the

187
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,910
pride of our nation, the Crown Prince of Joseon.

188
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,370
Since this is our situation, the only one left is you, Scholar Park.

189
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,010
What does the person from the palace think?

190
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,390
His Highness described you, Scholar Park,

191
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,030
as a top talent who excels in everything he does,

192
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,550
so a bit of shoveling would be nothing to you. Is that not so?

193
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,180
Gosh, seriously. Here, here.

194
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,930
Scholar Park, Scholar Park. Hold the shovel. Hurry up and start digging.

195
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,850
Come on!

196
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,120
Geez.

197
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,690
Stick it in properly and put your back into it!

198
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,020
I am!

199
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,500
At the rate of Scholar Park,

200
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,700
it will take three months and ten days to just dig up the body.

201
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,820
Forget it.

202
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,690
It is better to die than get sick from frustration. I will just do it.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,950
Wow, Eunuch Go.

204
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,430
I thought you were only good at deduction. You are also good at digging!

205
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,540
Aside from the unfortunate victims,

206
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,970
there is no one else who thinks this case is important more than me.

207
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,720
I will solve this case, no matter what!

208
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,650
   

209
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,850
Exhuming the body for an autopsy?

210
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,050
Did they really go to dig up the second victim's body?

211
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,660
Someone saw them go with a few other detectives.

212
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,840
Bring my horse. I must go to the East side.

213
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,750
   

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,920
That's a relief.

215
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,870
Thanks to the cold temperature of the mountain, the body has not decayed as much.

216
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,760
He died from a stab wound in his chest.

217
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,780
There should be a character on his body. Search carefully for it.

218
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,080
I do not see anything like a character on his body...

219
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,690
There is no way...

220
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,820
That is strange...

221
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,560
What is wrong?

222
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,190
He definitely would have died from the stab wound in his chest...

223
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,310
What do you mean by that?

224
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,560
For a stab wound received while still alive,

225
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,620
the flesh shrivels, and blood gathers around it, like this stab wound in his chest.

226
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,850
However, for a stab wound received after death,

227
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,440
blood does not gather around it, nor does the flesh shrivel up.

228
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,100
Since the blood does not gather around it, the wound also...

229
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,120
Like this stab wound here in his abdomen.

230
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,000
That means that, after he stabbed his victim, he waited until he died,

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,730
and then intentionally stabbed him again?

232
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,010
Is that not strange?

233
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,400
Even though he was already dead...

234
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,430
Why would he have done that?

235
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,130
Could you open up that hand?

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,330
I heard this case was quickly wrapped up as a robbery,

237
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,390
but they did not even investigate this properly!

238
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,900
What was written on it?

239
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,360
Family.

240
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,630
The character from the first case was "Song."

241
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,880
The letter from the third case was "Destruction."

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,630
If we put them in order...

243
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,790
"Song Family Destruction."

244
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,980
The destruction of the Song family?

245
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,930
Does the culprit want the destruction of the Song family?

246
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,190
Who are the Song family?

247
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,000
I mean, what did they do wrong that he wants their destruction?

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,110
It could mean one person with the surname Song or the entire Song family.

249
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,780
What does this person have against the Song family

250
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,270
that he would kill three people to curse them?

251
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,430
However, there is no way to know which letter he will carve on his next murder victim.

252
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,780
Would the meaning of these three characters change based on the next character?

253
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,210
Probably so.

254
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,410
The Joseon language requires one to listen to the end of a sentence.

255
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,550
Any idea what the next character may be?

256
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,430
Come on, Master!

257
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,570
Why would you accuse me!

258
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,920
We did not even figure out anything.

259
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,940
Are you out of your mind?

260
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,140
Why chide your stomach? It is only being honest.

261
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,330
It is about time for us to get hungry. We worked hard, too.

262
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:25,030
But there will be a curfew right now if we were to go into the city.

263
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,150
Will it be okay?

264
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,780
I have a plan.

265
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,160
Do not worry.

266
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,450
Whoa...

267
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,690
Yes, I am coming.

268
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,430
Gosh.

269
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,880
Eat plenty.

270
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,870
- I'm here! 
 - Young Master! Young Master!

271
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,080
My goodness, welcome, Young Master!

272
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,460
Could you prepare a table for me?

273
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,640
Yes, of course!

274
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,290
Gosh.

275
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,190
All right.

276
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,930
I heard the drum notifying the time.

277
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,390
Is it not curfew right now?

278
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,220
Have you not heard of the saying, braving the late-night curfew?

279
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,120
Conducting business at this hour is against national law.

280
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,200
How could you live keeping the national law all the time?

281
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,080
- You are so uptight. 
 - You are brash, young one!

282
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,020
- The national law exists for you to keep! 
 - You must've grown up in a well-off family.

283
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,130
I am merely the son of the Chief State Minister.

284
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,760
Goodness. How could the student be otherwise since the master is like this?

285
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,350
So what will you do?

286
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,310
Will you starve because of the national law?

287
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,100
All right, your soy sauce meat soup is here.

288
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,880
It looks so good!

289
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,280
- Young Master, please enjoy the food. 
 - Thank you.

290
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,180
All right, those who will starve can starve...

291
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,850
I will eat.

292
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,130
It is so tasty!

293
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,300
You should try it.

294
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,150
It is something the people of Joseon eat fairly often.

295
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,160
Man, they are good.

296
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,820
There is no knife.

297
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,150
- How can I eat this– 
 - He could not have done that unless

298
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,180
he had a deep affection for you.

299
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,270
What is deep affection?

300
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,260
Feelings of caring for and valuing someone.

301
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,620
Gosh, I am so jealous of you, Scholar Park.

302
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,930
Give me some, too.

303
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,650
Yes.

304
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,160
You see this here?

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,170
This shows that he lacks deep affection for me.

306
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,190
You do not rip a piece of kimchi with your hands for just anyone.

307
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,750
This is all a demonstration of my feelings.

308
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,320
How is it?

309
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,070
It is good.

310
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,770
All right!

311
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,940
This is not just any drink. This is shared affection of Joseon.

312
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,290
Goodness, why would you go out of your way to do this?

313
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,280
Oh, was the method I told you last time effective?

314
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,000
The rats in the ceiling... got really quiet!

315
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,290
- Thank you. 
 - I will enjoy this.

316
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,110
If rats reappear in your ceiling, let me know.

317
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,350
Okay.

318
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,020
Thank you for the drink!

319
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,070
All right, all right! Let me pour you a drink.

320
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,710
Goodness, let me pour you a drink.

321
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,720
Yes.

322
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,290
Let me pour you a drink.

323
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,390
And, Myung Jin, let me pour you a drink, too! All right!

324
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,670
Okay! Hip hip...

325
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,830
- Hooray... 
 - Great...

326
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,450
What...

327
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Am I supposed to do something?

328
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,270
What do you think would come after Hip hip, Hooray, Great?

329
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,560
What is it? Tell me, and I will do it.

330
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,120
Okay, then you start us out with "Hip hip".

331
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,710
- Hip hip. 
 - Hooray.

332
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,250
Great!

333
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,040
Nice!

334
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,840
Did you actually drink alcohol instead of just clinking bowls? You know how to drink alcohol?

335
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,430
Why wouldn't I? It was meant to be drunk.

336
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,260
I mean, you...

337
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,410
- You are– 
 - I am a eunuch.

338
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,490
A eunuch who likes alcohol.

339
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,660
Let me pour you a bowl!

340
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,690
Please pour me some as well.

341
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,590
All right, let us drink.

342
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,990
 Nice! 

343
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,640
Please drink plenty.

344
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,380
Whom did you learn to drink from?

345
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,090
I have never learned. Does Joseon ever teach anything to women?

346
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,480
Oh, it does teach some things... like sewing and housekeeping.

347
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,980
Are you saying that you drink so well when you have never learned?

348
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,800
All you need to do is pour the drink, lift the cup,

349
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,450
and empty it into your mouth in bliss!

350
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,490
Whom would I need to learn that from?

351
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,510
Have you not ever heard of drinking etiquette? Even in drinking, there are manners—

352
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,790
What is the point of all that?

353
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,760
When you are drinking, it is more enjoyable

354
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,420
to just talk, play, laugh, and cry

355
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,990
without thinking about etiquette. I learned by myself.

356
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,830
Although drinking is fun,

357
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,390
it is not everything in life.

358
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,310
Once you finish drinking,

359
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:54,060
the life you must live is waiting for you.

360
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,350
I see that the fourth murder has been constantly on your mind.

361
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,740
I am bothered by it, and curious about what that character might be.

362
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,620
But how come you have the calendar memorized?

363
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,850
Is not the calendar the basics of agriculture?

364
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,290
How could I not read it when my people rely on it for their livelihood?

365
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,450
I also believe that the calendar is important,

366
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,980
but the way it differentiates between lucky and unlucky days seems superstitious.

367
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,410
If you do not know it well, I suppose you may think so.

368
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,980
However, when you study the calendar properly,

369
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,270
you will realize that it delves into the laws of nature and the lives of human beings.

370
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,630
The four phases of human life...

371
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,510
Although it did get used in an evil manner this time...

372
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,190
What are you doing—

373
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,710
They are the night patrol.

374
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,870
Do we really have to hide so pitifully like this?

375
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,200
If we get caught, we will receive 10 beatings! Do you know how painful that is?

376
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,460
Do I need to know that?

377
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,520
Will I ever have to receive beatings?

378
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,410
You do not know about hide-and-seek, either, right?

379
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,220
I lived in the palace for a long time, so I do not know much about the world,

380
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,110
but how could I not know about hide-and-seek?

381
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,620
We are playing hide-and-seek. We cannot get caught. Whoever gets caught first will get flicked in the forehead, okay?

382
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,520
Are you saying you will dare to hit the Crown Prince?

383
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,270
Then do not get caught.

384
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:26,440
♫  When the quiet sound of wind approaches one step closer  ♫

385
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:35,470
♫  A stranger who brushed against my clothes 
 waving in the air is coming to me  ♫

386
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,260
Isn't your heart racing, too?

387
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,660
W-Why would y-your heart race? My heart is not racing.

388
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,360
My heart is racing so fast.

389
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,870
When I get scared, my heart races,

390
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:01,530
but I find those moments half-scary and half-fun.

391
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,940
I really like it when my heart races.

392
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,650
Right now, it is racing really fast.

393
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,450
♫  When I see you  ♫

394
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:21,810
♫  I try to carefully hide it  ♫

395
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:29,000
♫  But I end up lingering around you  ♫

396
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,210
♫  If I stay for one moment by your side,  ♫

397
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:44,450
♫  I end up unknowingly smiling at you  ♫

398
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:55,500
♫  Quietly on this night, when I think of you again  ♫

399
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:07,470
♫  What do I about my feelings for you?  ♫

400
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,920
Gosh...

401
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,500
Master... Come on, Master! Please get up!

402
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,530
We have arrived at your home. You should not sleep here like this!

403
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,290
Do not bother me...

404
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,900
Do you want to get dragged away by the night patrol in front of your house?

405
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,300
Young Master, Young Master...

406
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,140
Myung Jin.

407
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,700
- Myung Jin, please just get up! 
 - Gosh, let me be...

408
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,880
Geez, gosh...

409
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,250
Look here...

410
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,160
The youngest Young Master of this household is here.

411
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,970
Please, anyone, just come out! Look here!

412
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,580
Be quiet! My Lord is awake!

413
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,500
Did you bring our young master?

414
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,930
Young Master, Young Master!

415
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,180
What are you doing? Come and help me!

416
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,400
Young Master, Young Master!

417
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,500
On my back.

418
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,430
Gosh, so heavy! How do I put him on your back?

419
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,720
Oh, my, oh my... Gosh, be careful.

420
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,520
His shoe! Gosh!

421
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,340
Is he drunk again?

422
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,120
How much did he drink that he is in that state!

423
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,010
He did not drink a lot, but just a little...

424
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,600
And who are you supposed to be?

425
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,610
I am currently learning many things from Master.

426
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,360
How could you just watch while your master got to that state?

427
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,860
Sir...

428
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,930
Seriously.

429
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,290
I told you not to open the door for him if he comes home drunk. Why did you bring him in?

430
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,400
Just let him be, Hyungnim. Although he is pathetic, he is still part of our family.

431
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,810
If we leave him outside, it would only tarnish our family's honor.

432
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,830
- Hurry inside and lie him down. 
 - Yes.

433
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,810
Just lock him in his room, so he cannot go outside ever again!

434
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,010
- Gosh. 
 - What now...?

435
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,700
Gosh. Your head...

436
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,070
They are all his family.

437
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,090
But how could they all call him pathetic?

438
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,930
Do you not know what kind of family this is?

439
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,530
One step below the King, above everyone else. The Chief State Minister's family.

440
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,800
His brothers are currently an officer at Royal Archives and a scholar at Sungkyunkwan University.

441
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,220
But the youngest son not only barely entered Sungkyunkwan, but he got expelled.

442
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,460
They cannot be proud of him.

443
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,460
Please make sure to make hangover soup for my teacher.

444
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,210
Hangover soup, my foot. He would be lucky if he gets fed.

445
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:34,670
Do you know how scary My Lord is?

446
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,580
It is quiet right now because he went to bed early tonight.

447
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,110
Gosh, I'm sure he will get beaten with a broom first thing in the morning.

448
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,830
Pardon?

449
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,450
Gosh!

450
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:09,480
He is actually impressive once you get to know him.

451
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,400
Do you not feel uncomfortable running into Sergeant?

452
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,510
It would have been nice if we did not get to meet like this,

453
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,460
but there is no choice right now.

454
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,510
I do not think of it as a competition.

455
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,950
We are both just trying to prevent an innocent person from getting killed, and

456
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,660
arrest the brutal murderer.

457
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,570
I have a question I want to ask you as well.

458
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:57,360
What do you think of Sergeant?

459
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:05,500
It does not feel like you are just trying to judge my abilities.

460
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,090
It feels like you are trying to test his loyalty, too,

461
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,960
for some reason.

462
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,580
It is not like that.

463
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,770
I think highly of his abilities. His loyalty is also...

464
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,910
Could it be...

465
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,590
because of the ghost's letter?

466
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,340
 (T/N: She is saying a phrase in Chinese) 

467
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,330
"Your friend will turn his back against you and aim his sword at you,

468
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,080
and many will be killed as a result of your foolishness."

469
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,060
Is that why...

470
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,990
you are keeping your distance from him?

471
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,180
Are you worried Sergeant will aim his sword at you,

472
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,970
and are you afraid he will also

473
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,760
lose his life because of Your Highness?

474
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,060
A herald is already dead.

475
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,260
It is my fault.

476
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,410
He would have lived if I did not send him away.

477
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,500
Also...

478
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,400
Did you not blame me for your family's death as well?

479
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,610
I did not know you still kept that in mind.

480
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,670
I was afraid you cutting me off then.

481
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,720
That is why I said so.

482
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,270
It is not your fault, Your Highness.

483
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,110
Looks like he has not left the palace yet.

484
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,320
   

485
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,450
 Do you not find the dates suspicious, Sergeant? 

486
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,730
 The reason why he took the risk by carving characters on the bodies 

487
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,410
 is his motive for these murders. 

488
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,190
Go ahead inside.

489
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,590
Pardon?

490
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,200
What would I do in there?

491
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,800
He must be feeling bad because I made him compete against a eunuch.

492
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,080
Also,

493
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,600
he must have been feeling disarrayed because of you, his betrothed.

494
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,340
What could I possibly say to him?

495
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,630
Your Highness should go in and comfort him.

496
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,750
Your Highness must be worried about him, too.

497
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,010
Go ahead and cheer him up.

498
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,220
What...

499
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,770
Your Highness.

500
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,730
- Did you go out of the palace in disguise? 
 - Yes.

501
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,460
Why are you still in the Ministry of Defense office at this hour, Sergeant?

502
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,680
Is it because of the Sabangahn serial murder case?

503
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,480
The thing is...

504
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,190
I was going to visit you at daybreak.

505
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,830
This is a compass, is it not?

506
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:13,240
This was found among the things the government official of the department of Taoism

507
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,620
sold at a market.

508
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,730
Why did you say that nothing was found that day then?

509
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,830
Does it belong to someone you know?

510
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,050
It must belong to your father, Left State Minister Han Joong Heon.

511
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,100
It was not my father's.

512
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,340
There are people who have the same compass—

513
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,770
Two years ago, when an ambassador from the Ming dynasty visited,

514
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,880
several people received this as a gift.

515
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,300
What should I do, Your Highness?

516
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,750
What should we do at this point?

517
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,830
Now that we know it does not belong to your father.

518
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,870
Are you asking me what to do after daring to lie to me?

519
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,780
The moment I found the compass, I wanted to run to you, Your Highness.

520
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,840
But you came to me and said something else.

521
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,340
I thought I should check since I am his son,

522
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,740
but even if it were my father's, I would have told you the truth.

523
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,510
I wonder if you really would have.

524
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,940
I wonder.

525
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,870
 If the person who ordered to ruin the celebratory letter was your father, 

526
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,180
 what would have happened to you and your family? 

527
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,350
Do you think I would have forgiven you? Is that not what you were worried about?

528
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,710
Your Highness and I...

529
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,040
were friends before we were

530
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,330
the crown prince and his servant.

531
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,290
If we were friends...

532
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,560
If I were your friend,

533
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,660
what should I be doing?

534
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:02,070
Could you not understand how distraught I must have felt

535
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,440
because it had to do with my father?

536
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,820
Even if I hesitated...

537
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,530
Even if that belonged to my father,

538
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,640
I would have been on Your Highness' side.

539
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,580
Do you really not believe that?

540
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,680
I...

541
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,290
 Could it be because of the ghost's letter? 

542
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,930
 Are you worried Sergeant will aim his sword at you, 

543
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:42,670
 and are you afraid he will also lose his life because of Your Highness? 

544
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,160
When I became the Crown Prince,

545
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,670
I decided not to have any friends.

546
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,500
But I will keep your promise in mind.

547
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,030
Even if this belonged to your father,

548
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,160
you said you would be on my side.

549
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,140
You must not forget that promise, either.

550
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,350
 Who's there? 

551
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,250
Sergeant, you were still here.

552
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,030
What is this about?

553
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,640
He broke the curfew and lurked around suspiciously in the Department of Defense.

554
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,220
Stop it right there!

555
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,040
You are...

556
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,810
Yes, Sir. I am Eunuch Go.

557
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,880
I know this man.

558
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,800
Leave him here.

559
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,920
Did you accompany him, not Tae Kang?

560
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,710
There was a reason for it. I will get going now.

561
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,210
Hit me.

562
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,710
Whoever gets caught first is supposed to get flicked in the forehead.

563
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,600
I do not like... games such as this.

564
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,790
I hope you do not regret this.

565
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,090
 Six ministers and three state councilors from two years ago. 

566
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,150
 Someone among them... 

567
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,960
- Grand Prince always wants midnight snacks at the Queen's Palace. 
 - I know.

568
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,600
He makes sure to get drinking snacks when he visits taverns, too.

569
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,540
He should put that much effort into his study, too.

570
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,760
Look at His Highness, the Crown Prince.

571
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,250
He is gifted in both, academics and military arts. So talented.

572
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,420
Did you see Grand Prince playing Jachigi recently?

573
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,270
How is he good at nothing?

574
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:56,210
The late Crown Prince Ui Hyeon was so scholarly, too, apparently.

575
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,290
Grand Prince Myeong Ahn was born prematurely.

576
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,200
He must be lacking two months of maturity since he was born too early.

577
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,540
Gosh, come on!

578
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,300
You bitches!

579
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,670
How dare you talk that way about His Highness?

580
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,200
Forgive us!

581
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,290
You bitches! How dare you!

582
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,810
 How dare you make fun of the Grand Prince! 

583
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,390
What is going on out there?

584
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,880
- Right State Councilor is... 
 - Uncle?

585
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,330
Please forgive us...

586
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,730
You bitches! Do you still expect to live after that?

587
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,750
Please forgive us!

588
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,710
Uncle, what is going on? Please calm down.

589
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,890
Punish them and kick them out immediately!

590
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,880
Yes, I will punish them harshly as you wish.

591
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,810
They will have to stay away from the two of Their Highnesses!

592
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,500
Were you surprised, Your Highness?

593
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,520
Uncle, why did you punish them so harshly?

594
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,330
They are court ladies, but they are barely over 13 or 14.

595
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,510
They need to be punished if it is necessary.

596
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,520
That way, the servants know how to respect us.

597
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:43,870
Your Highness, I always considered you as my grandson.

598
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,900
Yes.

599
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,330
I know that well.

600
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,120
I also do not think of you as my niece either.

601
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,050
I think of you as my daughter.

602
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,330
I am always grateful for that.

603
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,940
I will not allow anyone to disgrace the two of you.

604
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,520
Do not be discouraged even if people make fun of you

605
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,550
for being behind in your studies.

606
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,340
Do you understand?

607
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,680
Yes, Grandfather.

608
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,420
It is getting late.

609
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,040
Court Lady Ahn, are you out there?

610
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,360
Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,340
Myeong Ahn, go to your room now.

612
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,310
- Court Lady Kwon, you can leave now. 
 - Yes, His Excellency.

613
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,180
Uncle. Did you punish those girls because

614
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,600
- they called Myeong Ahn– 
 - No, no.

615
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,320
Do not worry about their low opinions.

616
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,860
I am worried it might upset you.

617
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,370
You two can just count on me.

618
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,880
I do not know how I could have put up with the palace without you.

619
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,330
Do not put up with it, Your Highness.

620
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,930
You must be at ease.

621
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,280
You have to be at ease at home.

622
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,310
This palace is your home.

623
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,330
It is not just Your Highness.

624
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,030
Grand Prince's children will be born here, eat here,

625
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,680
and sleep here.

626
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,220
When Grand Prince gets married, he needs to move out of the palace.

627
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,560
That will not be possible, Uncle.

628
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,760
If he moves out, I will remain alone.

629
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,470
That will not happen.

630
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,690
Your Highness,

631
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,870
there have been many crown princes since Joseon became a nation.

632
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,880
But not all of them were put on the throne.

633
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,440
They got murdered, stripped of their status, or died from diseases.

634
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,480
I wonder why there were so many flowers that could not bloom.

635
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,470
You saw it yourself, too.

636
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:03,090
Crown Prince Ui Hyeon died in vain.

637
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:08,920
- Why can the same not happen to the current crown prince? 
 - Uncle.

638
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,310
Also, what is more interesting is this country called Joseon.

639
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,000
Crown Prince's paternal family cannot get involved in politics, but the maternal family can.

640
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,730
Since you are in the Queen's Palace, Jo family of Seongju became royal.

641
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,450
And we became the top elite family of Joseon.

642
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,100
So...

643
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,440
Myeong Ahn of the Jo family of Seongju should become

644
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,040
the crown prince and rise to the throne.

645
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,400
Your Highness, you must become the Queen Mother.

646
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,550
Uncle!

647
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,570
Become Royal Queen Dowager, and then the Grand Royal Queen Dowager.

648
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:53,690
Become the highest-ranking and most powerful woman in Joseon.

649
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,210
I will make sure to put you in that position.

650
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,640
Crown Prince...

651
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,090
will become deposed.

652
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:16,190
Why do you say something like that? No, Uncle.

653
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:19,910
I will pretend I did not hear it. Please do not say that.

654
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,220
Do you not know how scary the palace can be?

655
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,110
If someone finds out, both, Myeong Ahn and me...

656
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,230
It cannot be!

657
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,370
- I have heard you saying scary things before and– 
 - Do not...

658
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,770
take my words lightly.

659
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:47,470
I never gave up on what I set my mind to.

660
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,560
   

661
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,630
"Song. Ga. Myeol."

662
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,150
What could be the next character?

663
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,790
No! Min Jae Yi, you can do it!

664
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,470
You can solve this!

665
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,180
There must be something I have not found yet.

666
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,150
   

667
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,890
 This book is about people's difficulties in life. 

668
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,100
 I should be reading it as the Crown Prince. 

669
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,650
 If you study this book properly, 

670
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:40,310
 you will notice how it deals with nature's law and humans' birth, aging, disease, and death. 

671
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,610
I have to read this calendar for the people of this country.

672
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,160
It's filled with birth, aging, disease, and death?

673
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,400
What does a prince, coddled at the palace, know anything about it?

674
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,140
Birth, aging, disease, and death.

675
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,590
Birth, aging, disease, and death.

676
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,500
Birth, aging, disease, and death!

677
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,640
 He stabbed his chest, waited until he stopped breathing, 

678
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,100
 and stabbed again on purpose. 

679
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,870
 An unremarkable old man. "Ro" as in "old." 

680
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:14,410
 The man with diabetes. "Byeong" as in "disease." 

681
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,040
 He stabbed the man who stopped breathing. 

682
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,350
 He killed the man who was already dead! "Sa" as in "death." 

683
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,640
If so, what is left is...

684
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,790
"Saeng" as in "Live."

685
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,200
Someone who is alive.

686
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,990
Someone who is about to be given life.

687
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,920
A child who is about to be born! A pregnant woman!

688
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,000
What is going on?

689
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,560
It is me. It is Eunuch Go.

690
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,180
Is Eunuch So inside?

691
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,110
- Please let me go in for a moment– 
 - You cannot.

692
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,450
Please! This is important!

693
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,460
What is this commotion about?

694
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,910
My apologies! This is an urgent matter!

695
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:03,170
He finally fell asleep in the evening after reading.

696
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,600
I shall dare not to wake him up.

697
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,860
Do you want to be beaten? Be gone right now!

698
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,100
If so, please make sure to let me know when he wakes up.

699
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,940
I figured out the secret of the serial murder case!

700
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,810
I will prevent another death no matter what!

701
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,620
You must tell him!

702
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,650
Sir! Sergeant, Sir!

703
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,610
He is Eastern Palace's eunuch, Go Soon Dol. Is he not?

704
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,400
What is he doing here at this hour...

705
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,280
Sir! There is something I need to tell you!

706
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,600
I figured out the pattern of the murders!

707
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,370
It is just a eunuch's opinion.

708
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,350
Please do not worry about it.

709
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,610
This is about saving someone's life.

710
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,050
I will listen to it if he has something to say.

711
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,170
What is the pattern you found?

712
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:15,440
I knew you would listen to me.

713
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,520
I believed you would listen to even a lowly eunuch.

714
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,400
Tell me. We need to save someone if we can.

715
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,500
   

716
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,970
Leave the soldiers who left to the East side,

717
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,590
and make the rest of the soldiers ask the midwives on the West side

718
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,010
to locate pregnant women who are about to give birth.

719
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,250
- You must move as quickly as possible. 
  - Yes, Sir! 

720
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,400
Notify the Right Police Bureau, too, and join them later.

721
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,100
I will go to the site immediately.

722
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,680
Yes, Sir.

723
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,310
Let us go!

724
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,650
I will join them as well.

725
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,940
Capturing the culprit is completely different from solving the case.

726
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,550
You finished your job. Go back to the palace now.

727
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:07,090
I know that it is dangerous. But I will still go.

728
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:11,510
Please do not worry. I will never burden you.

729
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,230
Split into two groups.

730
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,850
One will follow the military officer, and the rest will follow me!

731
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,430
 Yes, Sir! 

732
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,690
Do you know of a house with a pregnant woman who is due soon?

733
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,830
There should be one if you go that way.

734
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,070
Do you know where pregnant women live around here?

735
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:55,290
I am not so sure.

736
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,750
Is there a pregnant woman in this house?

737
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,020
No, not here.

738
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,940
What is going on?

739
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,460
- Surround this house! 
  - Yes, Sir! 

740
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,850
We came to the far Western end of the capital, as you said,

741
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,480
but there is no guarantee that the murder will happen here.

742
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,400
All three cases that happened earlier

743
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,370
took place at the far end of the capital in each direction.

744
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,610
This is the most likely place.

745
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,550
Where did you learn that?

746
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,140
- Pardon? 
 - Your ability to solve cases.

747
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,990
It does not appear to be a talent one would expect from a eunuch.

748
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,280
Same with how you can ride a horse.

749
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,480
I heard there was a pregnant woman who was due soon.

750
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,040
 A little more! 

751
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,720
It came out. Just a little more!

752
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,460
It is a boy!

753
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,550
It is a boy.

754
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,280
My goodness...

755
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,040
No!

756
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:49,140
What is the reason you are doing this?

757
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,150
I should kill him...

758
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,510
I should've killed him!

759
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,460
Answer me!

760
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,580
You are...

761
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,970
You are the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau.

762
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,910
Why would the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau...

763
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,380
Soon Dol!

764
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,650
Soon Dol, wake up!

765
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,420
Can you hear my voice?

766
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,640
Open your eyes!

767
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,840
Take her to the Investigation Bureau.

768
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,910
Can you recognize who I am?

769
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,280
Your Highness.

770
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,440
I saved someone's life.

771
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,090
But you got injured.

772
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,730
You should have been careful. How come you hurt yourself?

773
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,540
Do you know how shocked I was?

774
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,930
Neither my family...

775
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,620
nor the herald died because of you.

776
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,060
Thus, my injury is...

777
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:11,360
not your fault, either...

778
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:25,440
- Where did Tae Kang go? 
 - Just let me be.

779
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,130
I will carry him myself.

780
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,900
Your Highness, let me piggyback him. Please give him to me.

781
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,550
Your Highness, why are you carrying him yourself?

782
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,610
- No, please let me– 
 - Stop right there.

783
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,500
He works for the Eastern Palace.

784
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,780
He is someone I trust.

785
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,790
So the only person who can touch him is me.

786
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:17,460


787
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:24,710
 His Highness does not trust even you, his dear friend. 

788
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,920
 When I became the Crown Prince, I decided not to have any friends. 

789
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,530
 - No, please give him to me! 
 - Stop. 

790
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,750
 He is someone I trust. 

791
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,830
 He is someone I trust. 

792
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:42,830
 So the only person who can touch him is me. 

793
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:51,630
♫  It was just for a moment  ♫

794
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,390
♫  On the day we smiled together  ♫

795
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:02,040
♫  I must've fallen like a leaf  ♫

796
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:11,900
♫  You understand my heart as if it is sick  ♫

797
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:19,700
♫  Because of that moment, I still...  ♫

798
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:27,020
♫  Will you come back to be even after we grow apart?  ♫

799
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,190
♫  Just like the wind  ♫

800
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,750
   

801
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,640
 This is not just a simple murder. 

802
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,110
 Does this have to do with my master's death? 

803
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,260
 We have to find the real culprit. 

804
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,690
 The only way to wash away the eternal sin... 

805
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:44,100
 is death. 

806
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,570
 You must have been afraid. 

807
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,570
 He cannot be the real Go Soon Dol. 

808
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,300
 Are you saying no one knows? 

809
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,810
 I will be by Your Highness's side. 

810
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,570
 Was everything he told me a lie? 

811
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:03,900
♫  You don't disappear  ♫
