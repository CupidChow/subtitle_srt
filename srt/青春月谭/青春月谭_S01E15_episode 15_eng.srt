1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,590
   

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,310
   

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,070
   

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,470
 

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,880
   

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,500
   

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,980
   

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,370
   

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,770
    
 Gosh! Officer!

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,500
How come you are...

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:55,040


12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,920
Move aside!

13
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,380
Hurry and notify the Minister of General Affairs.

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,240
And you, go and tell the Hanseongbu about this case.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,870
Yes, Sir.

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,370
Is it all right if I take a look?

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,590
Why are you, the youngest son of the chief state minister, getting involved in this?

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,970
It is a proper procedure for the head of the jurisdiction to do the first inspection when someone dies in the city.

19
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,040
By the time the physicians and body inspectors come

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,440
receiving the orders for the first inspection according to the procedure, it will be the middle of the night!

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,710
The condition of the body will deteriorate over time,

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,730
- so let me inspect it quickly before it is too late– 
 - Go away!

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,150
We will take care of this following proper procedure, so do not get involved.

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,010
 She suddenly ended up this way. 

25
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,360
 I opened the carriage when we arrived... 

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,220
If she died in the palanquin, then she did not get attacked by someone.

27
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,690
She ate rice cakes, but she threw up blood.

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,550
If she merely got indigestion while eating rice cakes, she wouldn't have thrown up blood.

29
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,050
Do you not think she died of poisoning?

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,180
If she was killed by poisoning, there must be a motive for the murder...

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,570
It does not seem like she would have had anyone hold a grudge against her.

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,410
What is wrong?

33
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,890
Perhaps, the woman who is in love with me did this out of jealousy–

34
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,840
Yes, that is probably not the case.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,430
If it is not that, why did she get poisoned?

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,410
Whoever it is, they would not have done that to her for having a grudge against her father.

37
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,740
But you know... Eunuch Go.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,940
I clearly saw you take the bracelet off of her wrist.

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,360
You, too, Friend.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,430
Why did you stay quiet when you saw Eunuch Go take something from the dead at the scene?

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,640
Also, you also knew something.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,510
Why did you hold me back?

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,810
That bracelet belongs to the murderer of Gaeseong,

44
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,140
Min Jae Yi.

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,410
   

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,980
You probably also know about the scandal revolving around Min Jae Yi.

47
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,150
This is the bracelet that was given to Min Jae Yi by Shim Young, who was rumored to be her secret lover.

48
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,670
Supposedly, he and Min Jae Yi exchanged and wore similar bracelets together.

49
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,910
T-Then

50
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,500
are you saying Maiden Jae Yi is connected to the death of the Minister's daughter?

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,660
How could that death be connected to Min Jae Yi?

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,640
It was just that she was in possession of Min Jae Yi's bracelet.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,300
Then why did you smuggle this item away?

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,630
Did you not take this bracelet because you are suspicious that there may be a connection?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,450
Hanseongbu will figure out the cause of death soon.

56
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,860
We will find out if there is a connection to Min Jae Yi.

57
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,310
I mean,

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,890
I suppose a person would not have died because of this bracelet.

59
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,940
It is not like this bracelet was cursed.

60
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,570
However, that does not seem to be what is important right now.

61
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,890
How did you know right away that this was Maiden Jae Yi's bracelet?

62
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,150
You, too, Friend.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,270
You also knew that this bracelet was Maiden Jae Yi's.

64
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,940
That is why you held me back.

65
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,000
Is that not so?

66
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,940
Why are you all quiet? All of you but me recognized this bracelet right away.

67
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,700
Are not the three of you all strange?

68
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,240
His Highness showed me the bracelet of Shim Young, the secret lover of Min Jae Yi.

69
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,090
I knew because it was the same bracelet.

70
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,500
I heard it from Eunuch Go.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,430
I heard from the Crown Prince.

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,220
Gosh, why does Myung Jin feel like

73
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,540
His Highness, His Highness is nearby?

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,810
I am suddenly starting to wonder if His Highness did not drop by Manyeondang in disguise.

75
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:33,350
If so... that would mean one of you two is the Crown Prince.

76
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,490
This was a fake.

77
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
You were not a eunuch.

78
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,970
Your Highness!

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,020
Manyeondang's Kim Myung Jin greets you, Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

80
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,460
Your Highness.

81
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,590
Your Highness!

82
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,830
Forgive me for the past lack of respect, Your Highness!

83
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,350
He is not. Let go of his hand and talk.

84
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,180
What do you mean he is not? Your Highness!

85
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,520
He is not. Let go of his hand- Stop holding his hand!

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,330
- There is no way he is not... 
 - I told you he is not!

87
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,180
- He is not! 
 - I told you he is not!

88
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Your Highness, Your Highness!

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,080
- This guy! 
 - Your Highness!

90
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Gosh, Your Highness.

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,310
Forgive me, Your Highness!

92
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,370
   

93
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,650
A chance to dethrone the Crown Prince

94
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,960
landed on my lap.

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,140
He dared to

96
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,770
bring in a girl into the Eastern Palace under the disguise of a eunuch?

97
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,390
Manyeondang's student is not a man, but a girl.

98
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,930
She is Jang Ga Ram, your maidservant.

99
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,700
If that were not the case, she would not have recognized that bracelet immediately.

100
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,280
If the master commits the crime of murdering one's family and the household perishes,

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,390
the servants must become government servants.

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,280
But... how could you smuggle her and keep her by your side, breaking the law?

103
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,850
- You must send her back even now–
 - I cannot send her back.

104
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,820
There is no place to send her.

105
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,290
If she left Gaeseong with you, a capture-and-return order would be out for her.

106
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,260
She put her life on the line to keep me safe.

107
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,580
If I didn't have Ga Ram,

108
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,220
I could not get past the city walls and would have been arrested.

109
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,170
I would never have gotten the chance to meet Your Highness and clear my name.

110
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,440
I must... find a place for her to return.

111
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,930
I must give her back a house where she can rest without fear of being chased,

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,540
and a daily life filled with only light worries.

113
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,670
She is like a sister to me, Your Highness.

114
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,800
She helped me to persevere.

115
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,180
People are able to persevere when they have someone to protect.

116
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,470
If she is captured due to capture-and-return order,

117
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,130
not only you but Manyeondang would be in danger. Do you not realize that?

118
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,780
Thus, I must clear my name as soon as possible.

119
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,540
Your Highness,

120
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,650
could you not also protect her as well?

121
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,130
What happened with that bracelet?

122
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,710
Would your bracelet and that maiden's death be connected?

123
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,030
I do not know...

124
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
 Are you sick? 

125
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,500
We must go back to Manyeondang.

126
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,450
I must take a closer look at that bracelet.

127
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
No matter how much I think about it, it is strange.

128
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,650
Did he not tell you he is not the Crown Prince?

129
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,270
How could Eunuch Go be His Highness?

130
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,470
He was a woman.

131
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,240
Eunuch Go is a woman.

132
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,140
What?

133
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,400
What do you mean by that? He is a woman?

134
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,670
Did I not grab Eunuch Go's hand earlier?

135
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,930
It was a woman's hand.

136
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,650
It is not like the hands of a man and a woman are different.

137
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,410
No.

138
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,510
Myung Jin knows about bones very well.

139
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,740
It was definitely the bones of a woman.

140
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,030
Even if it was not visible, I could see it all.

141
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,780
Then what about my hand?

142
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,480
What... Do you also have a woman's hand?

143
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,810
Gosh!

144
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,360
How could you have a woman's hand when you are a man?

145
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,580
A man can have soft hands like those of a woman.

146
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,320
How could you say you could see his bones after just grabbing his hand?

147
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,060
You just wait! One day in the future, there will be a machine that shows only the bones!

148
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,490
Why not say a machine that eats poop?

149
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,390
Goodness... What a smart student you are!

150
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,590
Then how about a machine like this?

151
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,770
After Myung Jin poops, water comes out

152
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,690
and carries that poop away neatly. How about a machine like this–

153
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,080
Master! You should say things that make sense!

154
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,040
Gosh, seriously!

155
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,000
But if a world like that does come, it would be really clean.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,380
If a world like that where poop is carried away comes,

157
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,130
I will sell water and become rich!

158
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,830
Come on! If you go outside, water is everywhere!

159
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,800
Why would anyone pay money to drink water?

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,230
I guess since Joseon is a nation with lots of water,

161
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,950
people would not pay money to drink water.

162
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,830
Gosh, Joseon is such a good country!

163
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,850
I, Myung Jin, will make Joseon even better.

164
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,910
I will accompany you.

165
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,100
I will remain your student forever, Master.

166
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,810
All right!

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,910
What is the matter?

168
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,040
How... How could this be?

169
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,880
Wait, this is...

170
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,130
My goodness...

171
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,500
This is the house where Oh Man Shik's sister-in-law lives.

172
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,590
Did the homeowner go somewhere?

173
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,770
I just moved here a few days ago. Who are you?

174
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,560
Where did the previous owner go?

175
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,840
Oh, the widow with two kids?

176
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,680
She said she was going back to her hometown.

177
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,420
I think she said it was Gaeseong?

178
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,490
 They said they were sending stuff to their hometown, 

179
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,740
 but it was a whole boatload of things! 

180
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,450
 Did you hear about where his hometown was? 

181
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,930
 He said it was Gaeseong. 

182
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,040
 How come it is Gaeseong again? 

183
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,590
What are you doing over there?

184
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,880
You are late in coming home today.

185
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,410
Is that not dried mugwort?

186
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,730
Do you believe the superstition that evil spirits would go away if they smelled dried mugwort?

187
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,610
I just liked how it smelled in the night breeze.

188
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,500
I felt like it calmed me down.

189
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,310
Are you anxious about having come to a foreign place?

190
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,780
Or are you worried about the Queen selection that you are so downcast?

191
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,260
Do not worry. Everything will go well.

192
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,590
Do you not think my father had a plan when he called you to come?

193
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,260
What kind of person is His Highness?

194
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,830
I heard he was your friend, Orabeoni.

195
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,800
His Highness is a naturally gifted leader.

196
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,700
He is wise and cautious,

197
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,010
and has an inner fortitude that keeps him from easily bending

198
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,210
or breaking under any circumstances.

199
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,690
Also, he is considerate and warm to people,

200
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,490
so he should treat you well, too.

201
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,860
I can guarantee it.

202
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,830
I heard that women get mixed feelings right before they get married.

203
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,240
- It must be the case for you as well. 
 - Is it different for men?

204
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,620
How was it for you, Orabeoni–

205
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,700
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

206
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,000
Supposedly, the woman you were engaged to died...

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,680
Although the world tells me that she died, I feel like

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,250
she is still alive for some reason.

209
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,750
People tell me that my fiancee betrayed me

210
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,180
and murdered her family to be with another man.

211
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,410
However, I do not believe the rumors from Gaeseong.

212
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,780
You never even got to converse with her

213
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,170
and you were engaged to her between families' agreement,

214
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,440
so how could you believe her unwaveringly like that?

215
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,100
If we promised to get married,

216
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,220
whom would I believe?

217
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,830
Would I believe the world or...

218
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,370
would I believe her?

219
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,930
I guess I want to believe her.

220
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,960
Since everyone else points fingers at her,

221
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,700
I guess...

222
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,480
I want to believe her for her.

223
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,840
Are you still waiting for that woman?

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,220
 Are you still waiting for that woman? 

225
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,510
 She is apparently dead. 

226
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,460
 She committed a grave sin and brought me shame. 

227
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,770
 How could I wait for her? 

228
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,320
I once received that same question.

229
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,960
That time, I said I was not.

230
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,500
Because I felt like a fool for waiting.

231
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,550
That is right.

232
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,690
I am waiting. I am still...

233
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,170
waiting for that woman.

234
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,570
But...

235
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,080
if she is still alive...

236
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,720
If she is alive and is not coming to you,

237
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,060
it could be that she has no intention of returning to you, Orabeoni–

238
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,140
I am sorry, Orabeoni.

239
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,020
I do not even know much about this, and yet...

240
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,660
You may be right.

241
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,130
If she is alive, she should have come to me.

242
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,910
And if she did not come to me, even though she is alive,

243
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,170
as you have said,

244
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,820
she may not have any intention to return to me.

245
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,120
It is nice to have a female relative.

246
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,710
I get to talk about things like this.

247
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,820
You can also tell me your secrets if you want.

248
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,410
I do not disclose other people's secrets rashly,

249
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,590
- so you can trust me. 
 - Yes, Orabeoni.

250
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,390
It is death by poison.

251
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,370
There was arsenic in this part.

252
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,550
Since this bracelet was given to Maiden Jae Yi by Shim Young...

253
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,050
The one who put the arsenic inside was probably him as well.

254
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,850
Right before Min Jae Yi dipped the ladle into the soup,

255
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,310
 he would have rotated this bracelet here. 

256
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,090
 That is how the arsenic would have ended up in the soup. 

257
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,370
 The one who put the poison inside probably intended to kill the entire family, 

258
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,380
but he probably did not expect Min Jae Yi not to eat the soup.

259
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,040
Then... that bastard Shim Young tried to kill My Lady–

260
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,070
He was trying to kill Lady Min Jae Yi as well?

261
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,030
Then why did he kill the Minister's daughter?

262
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,000
That death was probably a coincidence.

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,800
 Someone in Gaeseong probably sold this bracelet, 

264
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,740
 and probably ended up in Hanyang, passing through several hands. 

265
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,200
 It just so happened that the Minister's daughter bought it. 

266
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,370
 On the day she died... 

267
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,120
 I am a bit hungry, 

268
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,260
 can you go buy some rice cakes? 

269
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,220
 Yes, My Lady. 

270
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,890
 I like it. 

271
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,630
 What is this? 

272
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,450
 It opens. 

273
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,170
 It is an interesting bracelet. 

274
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,230
 I like it even more. 

275
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,960
 My Lady. 

276
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,140
 My Lady! My Lady! 

277
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,280
 - Are you okay, My Lady? 
 - Goodness! 

278
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,980
 - Goodness! 
 - My Lady! 

279
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,080
 Someone, please help! 

280
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,290
 My Lady! 

281
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,130
However, how come...

282
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,130
why did Shim Young...

283
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,150
Should we not take this bracelet to the Royal Investigation Bureau

284
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,860
and demonstrate Min Jae Yi's innocence?

285
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,140
That is right. We should tell the Royal Investigation Bureau right away and catch that guy.

286
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,750
We cannot do that.

287
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,580
The world is talking about this bracelet as a

288
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,440
token of love shared between the two of them.

289
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,180
If they say the two plotted this together, what can we say?

290
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,960
That guy...

291
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,600
is dead.

292
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,550
After leaving a will confessing his love for Min Jae Yi,

293
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,800
he killed himself.

294
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,470
Then were the rumors about him being Min Jae Yi's secret lover true?

295
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,530
 That is not true! 

296
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,190
How do the two of you know?

297
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,600
I mean, that is just what I think.

298
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,010
Me, too. I just think so...

299
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,030
Since Min Jae Yi disappeared after falling off a cliff, there is no way for us to know the truth.

300
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,270
However, based on the will that the Crown Prince showed me,

301
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,720
Shim Young seemed to completely believe that he was Min Jae Yi's secret lover.

302
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,050
Wait... how could he mistakenly believe such a thing as truth?

303
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,440
It is not like he was stung by a bee somewhere...

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
Did he get deluded by a ghost?

305
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
Even if he was deluded by a ghost, this is...

306
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,900
Tell me. What else do I not know?

307
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,140
Tell me everything that the three of you know!

308
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,940
The peony petals from the head shaman's house

309
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,870
was also found at the house of the Governor of Gaeseong.

310
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,410
The peony petals from the head shaman's house were found in Gaeseong?

311
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,380
Also, Shim Young was found dead with white hair.

312
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,340
Supposedly, he was not white-haired before.

313
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,450
He was not white-haired before, but he became white-haired...

314
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,990
You are home late.

315
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,940
Oh, yes, Father. I was busy with both public and private matters.

316
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,970
All you do is loiter around the streets. You actually had matters that kept you busy?

317
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,730
As you probably heard on the streets, the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs died.

318
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,320
Act cautiously for the time being.

319
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,130
Yes, Father.

320
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,540
Welcome home.

321
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,010
You. You do not even greet your mother as you come and go for the past few days.

322
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,160
Father.

323
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,330
Yes?

324
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,530
Have you seen the head shaman at the interrogation site?

325
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,520
Of course, I have. Why are you asking about that wretched lady?

326
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,870
Was her hair white by any chance?

327
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,350
How did you know that?

328
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,750
Was she really white-haired?

329
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,780
She was quite bizarre. An amur viper even appeared and bit her neck.

330
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,800
Amur viper?

331
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,280
A snake appeared out of nowhere and bit her neck.

332
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,640
When I asked about it later, they said it was an amur viper.

333
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,430
An amur viper as well...

334
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,100
Okay. I will be heading out again.

335
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,250
Where is this bastard going again without greeting his mother after coming home?

336
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,830
- Let him be. 
 - Where are you going at this time of night?

337
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,670
- Leave him alone, wife. 
 - That son of the damned Kim family...

338
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,610
Come now. I am also of the Kim family. Hold yourself back.

339
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,060
Gosh! That damned seed!

340
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,820
Is that something you should be saying in front of me?

341
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,970
 The commonality between the Sabangahn case and the Gaeseong murder case... 

342
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,760
 and an amur viper as well... 

343
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,750
Wait, does this not...involve the Crown Prince as well?

344
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,440
I need to find out why Shim Young put poison into this bracelet and who was behind it.

345
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,040
So, we can find out who sent you the ghost's letter, Your Highness.

346
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,380
You said you would not return to Sergeant after the case is resolved.

347
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,890
Are you thinking of returning to Gaeseong with Jang Ga Ram?

348
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,790
If I return to being Min Jae Yi,

349
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,750
I will not go back to Gaeseong.

350
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,300
- Why not? 
 - It was the house I lived in with my family.

351
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,080
It would be lonely to live there by myself.

352
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,030
I will send Ga Ram off to get married to a good household,

353
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,730
and I will live alone in Hanyang.

354
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,350
 I would need to live in Hanyang so that once in a while, 

355
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,310
 I will get to see Your Highness's procession after you take the throne. 

356
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,690
 If I can see Your Highness's face after you have become King, 

357
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,330
 I would run over 2 miles just to see your procession. 

358
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,330
What are you planning on doing if you live by yourself?

359
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,370
Would it not be good to drop by Manyeondang at times and help the Young Master?

360
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,000
We can solve cases together and help innocent people clear their names.

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,090
Oh, right! It would also be good to teach kids how to write Korean.

362
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,160
Scholars use Chinese characters, but written Korean language is an excellent and easy language,

363
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,600
so people of the low class could learn it in a day.

364
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,670
I will teach kids who need to learn the written Korean language, not kids of wealthy families.

365
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,460
When you become King, could you give me some donation of Heesa?

366
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,180
   

367
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,980
You would live by yourself in Hanyang, you say...

368
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,660
What kind of house do you want to live in?

369
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,530
It does not matter whether it is a straw-thatched house or a single-occupancy home. However,

370
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,290
I would like it if there was an apricot tree in the front yard.

371
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,590
If you live alone like that, would you think of me from time to time?

372
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,450
I would think of you whenever the sun comes up from the East,

373
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,520
for you reside in the East, Your Highness.

374
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,450
Since the sun comes up every day, I will end up thinking of you every day.

375
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,680
You would also probably...

376
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,510
think of me from time to time, right?

377
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,460
I suppose, occasionally...I may think of you.

378
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,600
Whenever I see a young eunuch rushing about clumsily, or when I see a eunuch who is good at cursing,

379
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,250
or when I see a eunuch who is rude to his superiors...

380
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,610
I guess I would be reminded of you.

381
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,710
Why are you buying so many things?

382
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,250
Why do you worry about selling many of your goods? I am buying them because I need them.

383
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,110
Of course. Are you sending them to your hometown again?

384
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,000
How many people are in your household in your hometown that you are buying so much to send periodically?

385
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,990
Are you the only one providing for your family back in your hometown?

386
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,290
You do not need to know.

387
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:25,060
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through! Move aside!

388
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,740
- Stop him! 
 - Hey! Move aside!

389
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,960
This is a very valuable and expensive item! Watch yourself and move aside!

390
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,790
Go over there!

391
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,230
- Let us go. 
 - Shoo!

392
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,440
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through!

393
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,670
 Why are you not answering me? Lift your head. Lift your head! 

394
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,830
 You... Who are you, and what do you do? 

395
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,640
 I am just a lowly man who barely scrapes by every day, Your Excellency. 

396
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,320
Wait.

397
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,630
Lift your head.

398
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,840
N-No, not you! You, with the round face that is, like a clove of garlic.

399
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,730
Y-Yeah, you! Lift your head!

400
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,840
Yes, Your Excellency.

401
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,380
Let me down!

402
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,120
Hey, you! Have you ever seen me before?

403
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,190
I saw you on the streets on the day your pottery broke-

404
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,220
Not that day!

405
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,000
Where would a lowly man like me have seen you again before?

406
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,010
Be careful with this.

407
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,610
I have definitely seen you somewhere before.

408
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,150
All right, look at me. Have you really never seen me before?

409
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,290
I swear to heaven that I have not.

410
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,570
You swear to heaven? Gosh, I am sure...

411
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,950
Gosh, where did I see you before? Your face is familiar.

412
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,720
Gosh, I... Gosh, forget it.

413
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,770
I guess I mistook you for someone else since you look so common like a clove of garlic.

414
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,510
Gosh, where did I see him before...

415
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,220
You wretch! I remember you now!

416
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,010
Are you not the man

417
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,030
who brought wet charcoal to my house last winter?

418
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,460
No, I am not. I sell herbs.

419
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,510
Then forget it. Gosh, where did I see you before...

420
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,890
Be careful with that pottery!

421
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,500
If that pottery breaks again, your life will also be broken into pieces.

422
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,400
You are hiccuping? Give it to me!

423
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,560
Go to the front and lead the way! Gosh, seriously.

424
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,610
Move aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through!

425
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,760
Move aside!

426
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,830
The Minister of Justice is passing through!

427
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,700
I gave you guys a lot. Please enjoy the food.

428
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,330
You do not need to do stuff like this.

429
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,440
My sister said we needed to work for our food.

430
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,500
We will clean that section, too.

431
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,710
Do not try to work for your food. You do not need to do that.

432
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,640
You should not raise children like that.

433
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,150
Go ahead and try it.

434
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,940
People need to work for their food.

435
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,210
I am not trying to receive credit for feeding you guys.

436
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,050
Parents should not raise their children like that.

437
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,320
I am saying this as your father.

438
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,610
Hey, Man Duk!

439
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,980
Come here for a moment.

440
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,400
Well, you children should go. Go.

441
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,620
You know about that place called Manyeondang?

442
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,000
You know that house is mine, right?

443
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,120
You know how I let that crazy young master rent my house.

444
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,580
But I think I should kick him out.

445
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,340
I do not know what he is doing in my house!

446
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,930
Things seem quiet without blowing up your roof, so why are you being like that?

447
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,330
The two scholars who drop by often are weird, too.

448
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,040
Are you talking about the two handsome scholars?

449
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,590
Those scholars are good people.

450
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,110
Why are you being like that?

451
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,840
A-Are you playing high and mighty because you have a house?

452
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,710
I do not have one house. I have two.

453
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,440
Is it common for a man around here to own two houses?

454
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,910
So what? What are you going to do?

455
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,380
Come close.

456
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,660
Actually, on the day the Minister's daughter died,

457
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:13,150
 I saw the small girlish eunuch take the bracelet off of the wrist of the Minister's daughter. 

458
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,910
How could he steal a bracelet when a person has died?

459
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,400
The two from Manyeondang and the two handsome scholars schemed together and stole the bracelet!

460
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,900
They were sending signals to each other like this and this.

461
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,520
They plotted this together. Are they not so evil?

462
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,430
A person has died.

463
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,780
How could they steal off her dead body, even if it is an expensive bracelet?

464
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,990
Those bastards... Those thieving bastards!

465
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,960
They cannot be from Byeokcheon, right?

466
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,200
That Chief State Minister's youngest son.

467
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,920
How could he hang out with the bandits from Byeokcheon?

468
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,030
If he were my son, I seriously would—

469
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,120
You would what? What would you do?

470
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Seriously!

471
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,660
I mean, if they were from Byeokcheon, I would have to drive them away-

472
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,910
Go! Go and clean up chicken poop!

473
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,790
- Go, go, go, go! 
 - Gosh.

474
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,090
Why do people hate people from Byeokcheon?

475
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,780
I told you.

476
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,280
I saw someone getting kicked out of the market because he was from Byeokcheon a few days ago.

477
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,820
That is why you should never tell anyone you are from there.

478
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,530
Is it true that everyone from Byeokcheon are bandits?

479
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,410
I heard you improved a lot.

480
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,590
I am sorry for making you worry.

481
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,080
I will rush your wedding.

482
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,450
Father. You should give it more thought-

483
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,390
Your princess will be the daughter of the Han family of Yeongsan.

484
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,490
By that, you mean–

485
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:59,040
I think you know better than anyone how loyal the Left State Minister and Sergeant are.

486
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,220
Also, the Han family of Yeongsan is altruistic and dutiful.

487
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,330
They are an elite family that is loyal to the King and has great integrity.

488
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,180
They do not compare to the greedy Jo family of Seongju.

489
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,710
However... that would make the Han family of Yeongsan the Queen's family.

490
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,070
In order for you to rise to the throne, you need a family to support you.

491
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,880
Using one force to stop the other force is also part of politics.

492
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,330
The Han family of Yeongsan is the only family that can stop the Jo family of Seongju in Joseon right now.

493
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,930
If the Right State Minister was behind the man who shot you in Paju, as you said,

494
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,740
what do you think that means?

495
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:40,890
They already revealed their ambition to drive you out and put Prince Myung Ahn on the throne.

496
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:47,140
Putting Prince Myung Ahn on the throne means that they will be taking control of the Royal Court.

497
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,840
If you cannot rise to the throne,

498
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,030
the country will be in danger.

499
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:59,950
This royal marriage is necessary for this country and for you right now.

500
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,240
Join forces with the Han family of Yeongsan.

501
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,210
That is the only way for you to take the throne safely.

502
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,980
Do you understand?

503
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,740
 Despite having arms, you will not be able to use them. 

504
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,150
 And, despite having legs, you will not be able to walk. 

505
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:32,490
 You will grow old alone without a wife and will die lonely without any children. 

506
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,310
This is a reward from His Majesty to the eunuchs who passed the loyalty test.

507
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:08,700
Continue to be loyal to the King from now on.

508
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,960
 Yes. 

509
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,400
I never thought I would eat this precious thing.

510
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,870
I think I would cry.

511
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,090
Is it good?

512
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,150
- Try it. 
 - Yes.

513
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,480
What did you discard?

514
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,130
It is my heart.

515
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,330
Court Lady Choi.

516
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,850
You served my late Hyungnim, did you not?

517
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,500
Yes, Your Highness.

518
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,280
Do you know

519
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,360
what he did with his personal feelings?

520
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,500
As the foundation of the country, Crown Prince Ui Hyeon

521
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,960
did not forget that he would become the king of the country someday.

522
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,780
He said the King is like the Heavens for the people.

523
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,740
So he guarded himself against having personal feelings.

524
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,160
Yes.

525
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,660
It is just my personal feelings.

526
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,470
What is the point of having feelings I cannot speak of?

527
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,890
And what is the point of having a gift I cannot give?

528
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,540
It is...

529
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
over now.

530
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,070
I was on my way to see you. I need to tell you something.

531
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,690
Go on without me. I need to discuss something with Sergeant.

532
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,470
When I visited Oh Man Shik's sister-in-law as you ordered, she had already gotten rid of her belongings.

533
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,030
I asked the neighbor and she said she was going to Gaeseong a few days ago suddenly.

534
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,870
Considering Oh Man Shik sending his belongings to Gaeseong,

535
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,830
how could they be connected to Gaeseong in any way?

536
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,440
I understand.

537
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,010
Thank you for looking into it.

538
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,860
I am glad that you look healthy.

539
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,650
Has your wound healed completely?

540
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,460
It is much better.

541
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,360
By the way, I did not see Eunuch Go earlier.

542
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,070
Is his leg okay?

543
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,020
He injured his leg in Paju that day.

544
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,440
He searched the whole mountain looking for you with his injured leg.

545
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,510
Did you not know?

546
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,030
Your Highness, allow me to treat you today.

547
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,380
It is a special snack from the King.

548
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,120
Have you ever even heard of a special snack from the King?

549
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,890
I brought that precious thing to enjoy with you.

550
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,150
Can you tell how much I care?

551
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,070
 Did you get injured at all? 

552
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,030
 No. Thankfully, I am okay. 

553
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,140
 Did you only injure your face? 

554
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,350
 It is nothing. 

555
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,080
I told you to wash the ink slab and grind the ink stick after you come back from the Eunuch's Office.

556
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,700
Oh, yes. I will do it right away.

557
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,310
Did His Majesty say anything in particular?

558
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,580
You look worried since you saw him.

559
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,670
He talked about my marriage.

560
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,920
Oh, the royal marriage.

561
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,860
Did you not say you had something to tell me?

562
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,560
Pardon?

563
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,960
When we were in the pharmacy's storage in Paju.

564
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,170
 Your Highness, there is something I need to tell you. 

565
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,210
 Please wake up and listen to me! 

566
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,270
Tell me what you... wanted to say then.

567
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:56,380
 It is not something I can tell you when you are about to get married. 

568
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,420
How come you are not saying anything?

569
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,000
I forgot.

570
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,350
I heard you injured your leg in Paju.

571
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,450
How come you did not tell me?

572
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,840
I get injured all the time.

573
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,750
That is not something to worry about.

574
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,500
You should report to me, regardless of whether I would worry or not!

575
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,290
Also, you told me a lie.

576
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,490
You said you did not get injured!

577
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,710
You got injured so seriously.

578
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,780
Did you want me to whine about a small wound on my leg?

579
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,360
Why are you nitpicking something that is already in the pass?

580
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,490
"Nitpicking?"

581
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,390
If your master points out your fault,

582
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,840
you should say, "My apologies." You rude bastard.

583
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,630
I told you to grind the ink stick, and you forgot that, too.

584
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,650
You will never apologize to me, will you?

585
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,560
You are as stubborn as an ox, too.

586
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,400
- What? 
 - You told me to grind the ink stick. Please hold your brush.

587
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,440
My apologies!

588
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,370
That is fine.

589
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,090
You can leave now.

590
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,940
What are you doing? I told you to leave.

591
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,010
It is time for me to stay with you right now.

592
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,070
I feel so uncomfortable when you are around.

593
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,910
Pardon?

594
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,990
How do you find me uncomfortable?

595
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,780
You...

596
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,340
are so loud and chatty.

597
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,180
You make me repeat myself several times because you are stubborn.

598
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,270
You make mistakes often because you are clumsy.

599
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,990
You only care about your thoughts. You do not care about serving your master.

600
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,420
That is unfair.

601
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,770
- I have been so caring all this time– 
 - Also,

602
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,490
you have no virtue as a woman at all.

603
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,100
You drink liquor and say vulgar things without hesitation.

604
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,340
And you reveal your dirty thoughts without any shame.

605
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,650
Also, you say you love someone wearing the eunuch's uniform.

606
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,870
You do not know when to run or walk, and you fight anything!

607
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,440
That is why you keep getting injured!

608
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,600
You injured your leg in Paju and your face during the loyalty test.

609
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,560
You do not listen to me when I worry about you.

610
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,310
You are not going to Sergeant, even though I told you to!

611
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,190
Who is the person you are in love with, anyway?

612
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,000
Why do you need to know so badly?

613
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,800
Will you marry me off to that man or something?

614
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,300
Yes. Just go to him.

615
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,430
I think you are determined to hurt me today.

616
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,320
Is there anything else?

617
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,190
You...

618
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,410
Above all things, you...

619
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,690
are not beautiful to look at.

620
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,000
Are you criticizing my face now?

621
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,250
Yes, I am so ugly that even the dimwit I love seems to hate me.

622
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,940
Leave now.

623
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,250
It is an order! Leave! Leave right now!

624
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,930
This is a special snack given by the King

625
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,050
to the eunuchs who passed the loyalty test.

626
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,950
I wanted to bring it to you and share it with you.

627
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,280
I wanted to eat as soon as I got it, but I held back and ran here.

628
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,670
But you listed all of my faults you never mentioned before and told me to leave.

629
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,800
I will go away and clean the library instead.

630
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,050
Please enjoy.

631
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,800
 He talked about my marriage. 

632
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,330
 Marriage. 

633
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:36,140
 Yes, His Highness was about to get married. 

634
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:05,740
They say it's fate even if your clothes brush against each other.

635
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,840
How come that ambitious woman left so easily like this?

636
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,170
I hope you go to a nice place to be.

637
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,080
Please go to a nice place to be.

638
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,170
 Goodness! 

639
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,260
 Oh my goodness, Soo Hyang! 

640
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,030
Gosh!

641
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,430
- Take care. 
 - Thank you for coming by.

642
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,420
His Majesty ordered

643
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,130
you to take time off to mourn. You should–

644
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,120
No. I should ask for Gibok. 
  (T/N: Gibok - Breaking the rule of not holding a position while mourning) 

645
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,540
The crown princess selection is starting soon with so many political affairs. How could I do that?

646
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,260
I know you are greatly heartbroken. Take care of your body and spirit.

647
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,420
Yes, His Excellency.

648
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,530
Go in now.

649
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,230
What a tragedy.

650
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,680
His daughter just died.

651
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,000
Should he not have figured out the cause of death, at least?

652
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,160
- He should have inspected the body. 
 - Seriously!

653
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,950
His daughter did not even get married.

654
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,150
How could he let some lowly body inspector touch her?

655
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,550
Seriously.

656
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,760
Are you offended? Huh?

657
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,940
The Minister did not check his daughter's body

658
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,160
and concluded the process by skipping the inspection?

659
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,620
When a lady of a noble family dies,

660
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,630
the family often requests to skip the body inspection

661
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,620
in order to avoid the shame of showing their naked body.

662
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,820
But at this rate,

663
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,240
there would be no way to seek justice on her behalf.

664
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,350
 Your Highness, this is Tae Kang. 

665
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,100
Come in.

666
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,220
Is Park Han Soo really from the Jo family of Seongju?

667
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,970
Yes, that is definitely what I heard.

668
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,370
He was not the only one.

669
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,210
The other officials of the Jo family of Seongju received even more money.

670
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,150
The Right State Minister definitely seems to be the one who paid them.

671
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,930
He could not have just paid them.

672
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,680
It must be related to what happened in Byeokcheon 10 years ago.

673
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,820
He said he needed to talk to the Right State Minister.

674
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,070
He said the world would turn upside down if anyone heard about it.

675
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,530
Show me the proof that he received money from the Right State Minister 10 years ago.

676
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,670
If so, I will meet him myself.

677
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:56,030
Your Highness. Why do you wish to know what happened in Byeokcheon 10 years ago?

678
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,070
If you find out... what will you do about it?

679
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,700
If something is wrong, I will have to fix it.

680
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,790
If someone were framed, I would clear their name and if someone was hurt,

681
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,890
I will comfort them.

682
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,570
Also...

683
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,330
if someone needs to be punished,

684
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,310
they shall be punished.

685
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,850
And along with that...

686
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,140
Is there another order you wish to give me?

687
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,320
Find me a house.

688
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,520
Somewhere not too far from Manyeondang of Jangtongbang.

689
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,440
It will be a place to educate children,

690
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,680
so the living room has to be big and bright

691
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,080
and it has to be safe for a woman to live alone.

692
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,210
Find out who lives in the neighborhood as well.

693
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,130
Also...

694
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:00,910
I would like the house to have a good view of the sun rising from the East.

695
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,200
Yes, Your Highness.

696
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,870
There has to be at least one apricot tree in the yard.

697
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:10,940
If there is no yard like that, hire someone to plant a nice one quietly.

698
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,960
Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,520
Only my bracelet was made differently.

700
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,780
Was he planning to kill my family and me since then?

701
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,980
   

702
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,240
   

703
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,870
   

704
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,610
   

705
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,350
   

706
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:48,330
 The Crown Prince is Scholar Park, who does not even know how to shovel. 

707
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:53,950
The one who did not show up the whole month while His Highness was grounded.

708
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:55,220
 What did you for His Highness? 

709
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,040
 I had a business to attend to. 

710
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,300
 I had to do some shoveling. 

711
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,340
 Who shovels for a whole month? 

712
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,130
 If so, Eunuch Go is... 

713
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,610
 You are going to use the Jeonban method? 

714
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,660
 You know about that? 

715
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,000
 I may not be the lady you admire, 

716
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,810
 but I think I can ask you to investigate the case together. 

717
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,730
Eunuch Go is...

718
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,260
   

719
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,780
Gaeseong's Min Jae Yi.

720
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,050
Are you looking at those papers again?

721
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,260
You should have another look to make sure you did not miss anything you know of.

722
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,960
   

723
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,090
   

724
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,470
Right!

725
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:49,000
That herald of the Royal Bodyguard Unit!

726
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,600
Lady Min saw his face in Gaeseong.

727
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,030
He was not the dead herald who came to Manyeondang!

728
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,040
- What are you talking about? 
 - So...

729
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,810
The man Lady Min saw in Gaeseong is

730
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:05,080
the Guardian Warrior who comes to Manyeondang to run errands for His Highness.

731
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,510
 But you know who I am. Me? Me? Me? 

732
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,110
 The head of Manyeondang, Kim Myung Jin. 

733
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:14,190
 But that Guardian Warrior was in the palace then. 

734
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:16,720
What is even stranger is

735
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,040
the man who attacked us wearing a mask on the day the red letters were spread

736
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,610
also looked like the Guardian Warrior.

737
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,820
Lady Min must be confused.

738
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,260
How could one person show up in different places like that?

739
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,710
It is not like he is Gil Dong of the Hong family. 
  (T/N: Hong Gil Dong, a Korean folktale character) 

740
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,870
- Did Lady Min Jae Yi come to Manyeondang? 
 - Pardon?

741
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:39,720
If not, how did she see the face of the dead herald?

742
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:47,600
Also, how did she see the face of that assassin on the day the red letters were spread?

743
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,340
How did she?

744
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,140
I am not so sure about that, either.

745
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,530
I heard it from Eunuch Go.

746
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:02,630
I will write this down myself.

747
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,210
 You are Jang Ga Ram, Lady Min Jae Yi's servant. 

748
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,970
   

749
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:36,160
It's Eunuch Go. Long time no see.

750
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,380
Yes.

751
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,000
How have you been?

752
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:52,820
Is it comfortable staying at the Eastern Palace?

753
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,580
Yes, I like the Eastern Palace.

754
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:06,000
Do you like the Eastern Palace, or the Crown Prince?

755
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,250
Pardon? No eunuch dislikes his master—

756
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,750
My goodness!

757
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,060
You do like the Crown Prince!

758
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,790
Of course, you like him!

759
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:22,160
Yes, of course. Yes!

760
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,100
Your Excellency, I am in the middle of an errand. I will get going.

761
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,500
Okay. Okay. Here you go.

762
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,050
Get going, then.

763
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,910
It is so poorly drawn.

764
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:55,400
This is why no one recognized her.

765
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,160
Who drew this, anyway?

766
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,920
Princess, are you also on your way to see the Grand Prince?

767
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,940
I heard he has been talking nonsense and throwing up what he ate.

768
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,800
What should we do about this?

769
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,970
Did Grand Prince get even more ill?

770
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,600
Your Highness! Please have just a bit.

771
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,820
Just try it once!

772
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,160
Princess, that is enough.

773
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,520
Even if he swallows, he will throw up again.

774
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,680
Forcing him will not do anything.

775
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,590
Grand Prince, your body will not be able to endure.

776
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,120
Court Lady Han should step out for a second.

777
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,250
Yes.

778
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,610
What are you so afraid of, anyway?

779
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,550
A ghost did not burn the oyat tree that day.

780
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,860
It was a human!

781
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,760
Orabeoni revealed the truth.

782
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,550
But Noonim, I am more afraid of humans.

783
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:16,820
They say there is nothing humans cannot do!

784
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,270
If a human burnt the oyat tree, he can easily kill me, too, Mother!

785
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:27,270
Why do you think that?

786
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,080
That will never happen!

787
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,880
Please get a hold of yourself.

788
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,670
Mother is right.

789
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,380
You have Mother, me, and Orabeoni.

790
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,700
You even have Father, His Majesty, by your side.

791
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,010
Who could possibly hurt you?

792
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,360
What is wrong?

793
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,350
What are you looking at? Look at your sister!

794
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,190
N-No!

795
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:55,360
No, Hyungnim.

796
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,150
Are you hallucinating?

797
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,720
What do you mean, "Hyungnim?" There is no one there.

798
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,150
No!

799
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:04,000
No! It is not me!

800
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,050
I did not know! I did not!

801
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,480
What is wrong with you?

802
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,790
I had no idea you were taking medicine with white Atractylodes and its root.

803
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,830
I had no idea!

804
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:17,400
I did not know that you would die if you eat a peach with it.

805
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,650
If I knew... If I knew...

806
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,970
I would never have given you a peach!

807
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,680
Mother, I gave it to him!

808
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,950
I gave Hyungnim the peach—

809
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,770
What are you talking about?

810
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,720
Do you really want to die?

811
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:43,030
 Your Highness! Your Majesty is here. 

812
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:32,970


813
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:41,030
♫  I can't see anything  ♫

814
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,300
 - Giyeok 
 - Giyeok! 

815
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,410
 - Kieuk! 
 - Kieuk! 

816
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,340
- Ieung! 
  - Ieung! 

817
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,600
- Digeut! 
  - Digeut! 

818
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,600
- Nieun! 
  - Nieun! 

819
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,360
♫  It became a scenery  ♫

820
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,760
 I would think of you whenever the sun comes up from the East, 

821
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,090
 for you reside in the East, Your Highness. 

822
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:09,350
 Since the sun comes up every day, I will end up thinking of you every day. 

823
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:14,720
 You would also probably... think of me from time to time, right? 

824
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,070
 I suppose, occasionally... I may think of you. 

825
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,240
 Jae Yi. 

826
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,030
♫  I wish for you  ♫

827
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,670
 I am sure I will probably think of you every day as well. 

828
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:31,150
 I will think of you whenever I go to the library. 

829
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,200
♫  that no shadows  ♫

830
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,880
 I will think of you when I go to the room you used to stay in, too. 

831
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,950
 I can protect you, and you can protect me. 

832
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:47,820
 Even when I am sitting on my seat, I will be reminded of you. 

833
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:53,850
 Even when I see a short and skinny eunuch, when I get dressed, 

834
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:57,950
 and whenever I am walking in the big palace, 

835
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,990
 I will be thinking of you. 

836
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,850
♫  Away from you  ♫

837
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:06,860
 Jae Yi, if you get to live in this house, 

838
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,260
 I will be left alone in the palace. 

839
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,160
 After you leave me, 

840
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,190
 who will I be able to be frank with, 

841
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,100
 who will I be able to rely on, 

842
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:27,520
 and who will I be able to... laugh with? 

843
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:35,310
♫  My heart is aching because it's filled with sorrow  ♫

844
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:41,390
♫  It hurts because there's nothing I can do  ♫

845
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:50,840
♫  Just remember me as someone you miss  ♫

846
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,560
♫  Someone like me...  ♫

847
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,910
   

848
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:57,670
 Who is that dimwit you are in love with? 

849
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,580
 So Eun of the Han family. 

850
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,030
 I heard a strange rumor when I went to the cemetery for my daughter. 

851
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,160
 Will you just sit back and watch? 

852
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,800
 I am afraid you will be in danger if you fight them. 

853
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,960
 You should protect me. 

854
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,220
 How come you always trust me? 

855
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,950
 I definitely saw you near the Royal Kitchen. 

856
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,110
 Are you that fearless wearing the eunuch's uniform as a woman? 

857
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,430
 I need to know the truth in order to protect you. 

858
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:20,490
 Mother! 

859
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,370
 Everything was a lie! 

860
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:28,200
♫  You'd be thinking endlessly...  ♫
