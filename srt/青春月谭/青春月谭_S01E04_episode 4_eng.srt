1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,410
   

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,430
   

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,030
   

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,660
   

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,440
   

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,020
   

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,030
   

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,920
   

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,120


10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
 We found the signs of someone living inside a cave in Mount Songak. 

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,320
 Most of it has already been burnt into ashes, 

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,460
but fragments of a noble maiden's dress were there.

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,340
But, Sir, she could have been staying there before she fell from the cliff,

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,900
and it could also not be the Lady's.

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,410
She is probably alive.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,820
She must be alive.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,130
Did you...

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,700
- find out about him? 
 - Excuse me?

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,190
Oh, the man who is supposed to be the lady's lover–

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
He disappeared from Gaeseong after His Lordship's funeral.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,670
Supposedly, he was teaching at the Gaeseong Temple, but nobody has seen him since.

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,000
Find him...

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,870
and

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,250
bring him to me.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,350
Also, continue to search for the Maiden's whereabouts.

26
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,360
Yes, Sir.

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,320
Why are you staring like that?

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,590
Looking at you closely like this,

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,260
you still look like when you were a child.

30
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,930
You're right. We met...

31
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,700
when we were children.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,390
Did you remember, too?

33
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes.

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,820
   

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,550
 Did I not tell you? 

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,580
 I told you it is dangerous to go outside of the palace. 

37
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,410
 This is all because of that thief we met at the creek. 

38
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,800
 What a wicked bastard... 

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,030
 It is clear that he told us the wrong way on purpose! 

40
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,060
 So why did you tell me to give him the money? 

41
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,640
 That was all I had... 

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,960
 You left on a journey with the Grand Prince, 

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,870
 and all you brought was just two nyang? 

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,190
 How could I have known that you were going to jump the palace walls? 

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,100
 I thought that you would, of course, bring along a eunuch or a guard– 

46
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,910
 Oh, let me ask you for some directions. 

47
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,120
 Where is Sir Min Ho Seung's house? 

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,400
 It is that house. 

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,840
 I was worried. 

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,430
 Someone had come by from the Palace about both of you. 

51
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,280
 Go to the Palace and notify them 

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,560
 - that both of them are safe. 
 - Yes, My Lord. 

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,060
 We ended up in this state after being victimized by a thief. 

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,220
 after being victimized by a thief. 

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,490
 Did you meet a thief? 

56
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,120
 He was a shameless and heinous thief 

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,700
 taking tolls from people saying he was the owner of a creek. 

58
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,100
 How could there be an owner of a creek that all people have a right to use? 

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,890
 We should send a message to the government office right away 

60
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,810
 - and catch that thief– 
 - Hurry up and come! 

61
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,500
 Mother, I caught a thief. 

62
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,670
 Whether it be the ink stone that the King gifted you, Father, or your silver ring, Mother... 

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,400
 The things that have gone missing recently were stolen by this guy! 

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,060
 Wait... 

65
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,640
 You wretch! 

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,000
 That's right, you wretch! Look at us! 

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,650
 Master, it's that boy! 

68
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,320
 The thief we encountered! 

69
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,150
 Do you know the difficulties we faced because of you? 

70
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,110
 It was not enough for you to steal from us, 

71
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,810
 but you would even lay hands on a nobleman's family possessions? 

72
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,150
 I will have you harshly punished by national law! 

73
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,260
 Please still your anger. 

74
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,830
 Sir, what should we do? 

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,590
 I mean, why would you protect this guy, My Lady? 

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,390
 Save me, Father! 

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,710
 Father? 

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,850
 I'm quite sure that the Master only has one son... 

79
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,400
 How is it... that you have... 

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,460
 two sons? 

81
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,150
 This child... is not my son. 

82
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,860
 She is my younger sister. 

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,570
 Sister? 

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
 Then this boy– 

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,100
 I mean, this girl... 

86
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,150
 is your daughter, Master? 

87
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,270
 Why did you do such a thing? 

88
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,240
 Did you really steal 

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,130
 and took our family possessions and sell them? 

90
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,910
 I really needed the money. 

91
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,180
 Do not make excuses! 

92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,300
 If you have broken the law, you must take responsibility for it. 

93
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
 Just as the Grand Prince has said, 

94
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,770
 I should report you to the government office. 

95
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,820
 No, you cannot! 

96
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,500
 If you need to turn over someone to the government office, hand me instead. 

97
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,030
 I am the thief. 

98
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,500
 The lady saved me with that money. 

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,370
 The lady saved me with that money. 

100
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,010
 She spent that money to save me from getting sold into slavery 

101
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,100
 because I could not pay interest payments 

102
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,540
 for my dead parents' debt. 

103
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,260
 Thus, 

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,270
 I'm the thief who should be punished. 

105
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,610
 That is why you took that money... 

106
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,630
 What is your name? 

107
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,160
 It is Young. 

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,820
 Shim Young. 

109
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,390
 I did not forget. 

110
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,380
It was the first time I met the Young Master, so how could I forget?

111
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,900
"Young Master?"

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,710
Are you talking about the Sergeant?

113
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,860
I fell in love at first sight.

114
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,830
There is no way.

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,080
You would steal money from the one you fell in love with at first sight?

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,780
I mean, between those two guys...

117
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,170
I mean, between you two sirs, the Young Master was still

118
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,590
way better than you.

119
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,090
I'm talking about his face.

120
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,470
This is the first time I'm hearing that my face looks inferior to the Sergeant.

121
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,590
In my eyes, it's like that.

122
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,800
 Then I can just live completely under her control. 

123
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,030
All right. You two are a perfect match.

124
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,140
That will be enough.

125
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,280
Call Eunuch So.

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,750
Since I am wearing a eunuch uniform, just think of me as a eunuch.

127
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,680
You wore it backward, Your Highness.

128
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,350
You were the one who put it on just now.

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,650
 A heart that wants to fall in love. Would you call that love, too? 

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,490
 When I heard that Master's daughter 

131
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,020
 Min Jae Yi was my fiancée, how I felt... 

132
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,730
 The joy that I felt, you probably would not know it. 

133
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,960
 If you ask how I could love my fiancée that our family set up for us, 

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,570
 I will answer you as your husband 

135
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,670
 on the day of our wedding. 

136
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,260
 I await for that day to come. 

137
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,190
 So come to me sweetly 

138
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,690
 wearing these flower slippers. 

139
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,120
 I asked you to come to me like a flower, 

140
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,520
 but did you run away into another man's arms? 

141
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,380
 How... 

142
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,360
 How could you cause me to suffer so? 

143
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,280
Rice wine lees!

144
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,760
It is easy for a body that has been dead for a while for its wounds to disappear,

145
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,770
but if you cover the area with rice wine lees and take them off

146
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,440
and wipe it with water boiled with juniper, the hidden wounds would reappear.

147
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,400
- Where do you use vinegar? 
 - For vinegar...

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,080
- You failed! You failed! 
 - Just hold on a minute!

149
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,350
How is your patience more lacking than the neighbor's dog?

150
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,810
"T-The neighbor's dog?"

151
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,030
I just remembered.

152
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,390
The vinegar is sprinkled on the murder weapon to find the blood stains that the culprit erased.

153
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,990
If you sprinkle vinegar on the knife after it's been heated up with a wood fire,

154
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,130
the hidden bloodstains are revealed!

155
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,150
You've passed.

156
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,580
You must be happy since you passed and also beat your master.

157
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,890
How could I beat my master, who is like the heavens to me?

158
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,950
It's just this disciple's meager attempts to retain my master's brilliance.

159
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,790
Yes, you will have to try really hard.

160
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,950
Since you are not even close to reaching your master's feet in fieldwork.

161
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,660
Yes.

162
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,140
I mean, why is this not coming apart?

163
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,530
I wish I could just cut it off instead.

164
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,200
Cut...

165
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,790
 Cut it off? 

166
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,260
Do you have scissors? I want to cut this off.

167
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,230
 What do you mean by cutting it off!? 

168
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,900
I mean, scissors...

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,150
Are you really a eunuch?

170
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,210
If I am not a eunuch, then what would I be?

171
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,560
Oh, my, look at this guy.

172
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,010
Do you not know that there are certain things you must never say to a eunuch?

173
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,610
I mean, I just...

174
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,960
felt like it would be much neater if this were gone,

175
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,040
so why would–

176
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,480
Right...

177
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,020
 Right? 

178
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,800
I really don't like him. He's so insensitive.

179
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,820
I mean, he's in the same boat as us.

180
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,160
You put all of this in the warehouse all by yourself.

181
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,600
 We are not going to help you! 

182
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,340
Move...

183
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,740
So look here, Grand Prince, Your Highness.

184
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,550
I place it on top of this.

185
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,440
Then, if you hit it like this...

186
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,570
You saw it, Your Highness?

187
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,070
It is nothing too difficult, I see. I will do it properly this time.

188
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,810
Gosh, so frustrating. I will do it.

189
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,550
It is harder than it looks.

190
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,910
It is not that I am bad at it.

191
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,860
Move over.

192
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,540
How could you complain about this being difficult?

193
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,970
Here, try it again.

194
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,120
All right, get in position...

195
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,310
Hold it tight.

196
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,270
Try it now.

197
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,690
Eunuch Go!

198
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,150
Are you all right?

199
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,880
Make sure to watch where you are going.

200
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,170
Yes, Sir.

201
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,580
You must have been so scared.

202
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,300
Are you not the Sergeant?

203
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,540
Yes, Your Highness.

204
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,510
It has been a while, Princess.

205
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,970
Eunuch Go, I am glad you were not hurt.

206
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,560
Yes, it is such a relief.

207
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,180
I am fine.

208
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,030
Mother, he is a new eunuch working at the Eastern Palace.

209
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,450
Is that right?

210
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes, Your Highness.

211
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,210
I am Go Soon Dol, the new eunuch at the Eastern Palace.

212
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,470
We almost injured the valuable new eunuch working at the Easter Palace.

213
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,640
It is a relief that you prevented that, Sergeant.

214
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,910
It was nothing, Your Highness.

215
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,680
He is the Sergeant.

216
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,410
It is the first time meeting you, Sergeant, Sir.

217
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,650
It is nice to meet you.

218
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,410
Is His Highness at the Eastern Palace?

219
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,190
A moment ago, he went to the royal guards' training grounds.

220
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,460
Then I shall make my leave.

221
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,290
Sergeant, do you know how to play jachigi?

222
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,450
Yes, I know how to play,

223
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,110
- but I need to go and meet His Highness... 
 - Come here.

224
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,760
Please teach the Grand Prince.

225
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,460
I mean, Noonim is good at it, too,

226
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,540
so she could just teach me, so why...

227
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,090
One more time!

228
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,030
Why is it not working so well today?

229
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,690
You were swinging it so well and sending it flying before.

230
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,860
Gosh, hey!

231
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,950
"Hey?"

232
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,910
Are you sure His Highness really had me pull this cart all by myself?

233
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,090
Then do you think he would have told me to do it?

234
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,300
Then why do I feel like His Highness's order would have been different?

235
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,970
I feel like His Highness would have said you should pull the wagon from the front

236
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,040
you should pull the wagon from the front

237
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,710
- and Soon Dol should push from the back.

238
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,170
This little...

239
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,640
Hit me, hit me! I am losing it, so whatever!

240
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,490
I am tired to death, so just hit me and pull it with me!

241
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,350
Hit me!

242
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,920
Hit me!

243
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,290
Is it a chicken or a bird?

244
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,020
Man Duck! Hurry and catch it!

245
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,780
Catch it!

246
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,690
What are you doing? Hurry and find out what happened.

247
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,240
Gosh, these guys!

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,770
What happened?

249
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,490
We did not do anything!

250
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,510
All we did was mix a few things...

251
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,010
They just mixed and exploded by themselves!

252
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,690
Move over. I must go inside to check!

253
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,000
- It is perfectly fine in there! 
 - We did not do anything.

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,850
We are the only ones to get a bit banged up. That is all.

255
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,470
How is it that you guys cause trouble every three days?

256
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,380
How long has it been since you destroyed the roof that you are doing this?

257
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,910
Move out of my house!

258
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,610
No, you cannot do that. Do you know who this person is?

259
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,680
Do you think I do not know?

260
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,370
Are you not the troublesome youngest son of the Chief State Minister?

261
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,760
I know him better than you do.

262
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,160
Gosh, it drove me nuts when he was causing all this trouble by himself.

263
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,620
But now he has another weird guy with him as well...

264
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,590
- What is this? 
 - Soon, the world will acknowledge my genius.

265
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,720
Aigoo, you did not have to pay me so much...

266
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,040
You should go to the pub and have a bowl of unrefined rice wine.

267
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,550
You must be so upset because of us, so please have a refreshing drink.

268
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,700
Well, just use it comfortably.

269
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,430
Goodness. They sent another person from the palace.

270
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,280
Is that man in the high position giving me another job to do?

271
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,900
Gosh, as expected,

272
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,580
the only one who recognizes my talent is that high person!

273
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,570
Goodness... A sword... I should just go and catch my chickens.

274
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,300
Let us go inside.

275
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,080
 My Lady... 

276
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,000
 Ga Ram... 

277
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,610
Say hello. He serves the Crown Prince.

278
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,700
Oh, yes.

279
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,800
I recently took him up as my student.

280
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,880
Tell him the reason why you came to me.

281
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,800
I decided to serve him as my master because I heard that he was famous

282
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,820
throughout the land as someone capable of figuring out the cause of death just by looking at a corpse.

283
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,060
That is what they say.

284
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,260
But who is this?

285
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,830
I am Eunuch Go Soon Dol, and I am serving His Highness.

286
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,280
It is nice to meet you.

287
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,960
I am his student.

288
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,620
Open the wagon.

289
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,450
Yes.

290
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,230
I mean, how could you not even tell me that it was a dead body?

291
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,690
Do I need to find out the cause of death?

292
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,790
How long will it take?

293
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,710
I, I, I am Kim Myung Jin!

294
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,790
Since I have gained a useful student, I will try to finish it today.

295
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,000
- Look carefully at this man's face. 
 - Pardon me?

296
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,280
- Why do I need to do that? 
 - It is His Highness's orders.

297
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,090
Is it someone I should know?

298
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,070
You talk too much! Just take a good look at him!

299
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,430
I am looking right now. You also talk too much.

300
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,320
It appears that he was part of the Royal Guard.

301
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,700
He was a herald sent by His Highness to the Governor of Gaeseong.

302
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,280
The herald sent by His Highness to that house ended up dead?

303
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,950
He was sent along with the wedding gifts, but he ended up like this.

304
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,990
Did this happen before or after the tragic events took place at that house?

305
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,160
I do not know.

306
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,930
I heard that they found his body after those events took place.

307
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,390
Next.

308
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,350
Next.

309
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Next!

310
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,400
Moo Ik!

311
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,230
My apologies.

312
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,190
How are you to protect the Crown Prince when you are this weak?

313
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,780
Increase the training of the Royal Guard!

314
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,560
 Yes, Your Highness! 

315
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,230
Also, in order for you to endure such hard training, you would need to eat well.

316
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,080
Today, eat and drink to your heart's content.

317
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,830
Wait there and return when you find out the cause of death from them.

318
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,390
Yes.

319
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,250
   

320
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,360
   

321
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,970
Please let this slide just once!

322
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,910
My master has nothing to do with this criminal.

323
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,910
He has never seen this person ever before.

324
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,580
I love that woman.

325
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,510
He says that he loves you...

326
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,130
No, that is not true.

327
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,160
Maybe it is because he feels bad for this heinous woman.

328
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,770
He keeps saying things like Gaeseong's true detective is Min Jae Yi and not her brother,

329
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,360
and that she would not be dead, but alive.

330
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,980
He made all these ridiculous deductions

331
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,270
and brought these wanted posters home.

332
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,070
Gosh. I will make sure that nothing like this happens again,

333
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,870
so please let this slide just once.

334
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,050
Ridiculous?

335
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,840
I came to this conclusion from my own investigations... It is the truth!

336
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,820
Maiden Jae Yi is truly a detective!

337
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,870
He came from the Palace!

338
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,490
Do you not know what happens if you lay your hands on wanted posters?

339
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,560
Come over here and look at the corpse.

340
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,860
What do you think is the cause of death?

341
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,360
Well...

342
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,020
When you look here, there is an arrow wound-

343
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,540
It does not look like the arrow pierced him that deeply...

344
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,520
I mean, the wound is shallow, so why did he die?

345
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,810
It is most likely from poison.

346
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,790
- He died from poison? 
 - These are wounds created by scratching himself.

347
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,430
Right before he died, he must have instinctively grabbed his neck as he struggled to breathe.

348
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,280
They must have coated the arrowhead with something interesting.

349
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,560
- My student? 
 - Yes.

350
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,000
- Make me a nice warm bowl of rice. 
 - Rice?

351
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,130
You ate so much rice soup earlier, so why ask for more rice?

352
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,920
It is not for me.

353
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,150
- It is for him. 
 - What?

354
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,750
I mean, how could a dead man eat rice?

355
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,160
Will you use the Jeonban method?

356
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,580
Wait, Eunuch Go...

357
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,710
Do you know about the Jeonban method as well?

358
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,410
It was after his family had already fled.

359
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,320
It is clear that he had planned this for a very long time.

360
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,390
Was there nothing among what he sold that could be corroborative evidence?

361
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,160
Are you telling me that you were not able to find any clues at all?

362
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,900
That is so, Your Highness.

363
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,270
Open the lid.

364
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,320
What is this?

365
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,490
It is animal blood.

366
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,020
Why are you putting the rice that you put in the dead person's mouth into the blood?

367
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,500
Even though I already have the answer, I should check one last time.

368
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,170
Gosh.

369
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,690
What do I do?

370
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,860
It is so clear that it was death by poison.

371
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,420
How is it that it is perfectly aligned with what I had expected, Myung Jin?

372
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,130
Myung Jin, you are a genius!

373
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,840
Myung Jin, you are for sure a genius!

374
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
You are right. Master, you are really a genius.

375
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,900
Is it truly death by poison?

376
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,190
Please tell the Crown Prince it is the same poison from a year ago.

377
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,260
It is amur viper poison.

378
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,780
Only one poison makes one's blood coagulate and causes one's body to petrify to death.

379
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,330
It is amur viper poison.

380
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,400
How is life at the Eastern Palace?

381
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,590
I was so shocked earlier.

382
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,240
I would have never imagined that you would be at Manyeondang.

383
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,570
I could not just sit around doing nothing while waiting for you to come back, Lady...

384
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,450
You are going through a lot because of me.

385
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,020
- I am sorry. 
 - As long as you are okay, Lady,

386
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,750
it does not matter what happens to me.

387
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,770
I do not take your dedication and obedience for granted.

388
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,180
Thank you.

389
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,640
I also do not take how you worry and care about me for granted.

390
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,660
You have never looked down on me or beat me.

391
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,920
You have always treated me as a human being.

392
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,900
I have also been so grateful to you all this time.

393
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,620
Oh, right. Did you ever see that herald in Gaeseong?

394
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,530
When I heard that earlier, I was so shocked.

395
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,090
What in the world is going on...

396
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,270
I mean, how could the herald sent by the Crown Prince also die?

397
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,130
And at Gaeseong at that...

398
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,890
Did you just say that it was amur viper poison?

399
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,300
He said that it was the same poison that you were hit by a year ago.

400
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,980
What does that mean?

401
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,420
If it was the poison from a year ago...

402
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:07,300
Was the poison on the arrow that hit you also amur viper poison?

403
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,440
Did you see the man's face?

404
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,810
I have never seen him before.

405
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,360
Did it happen on the way back to the palace?

406
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,700
If you received the wedding present, it was probably on the way back.

407
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,730
What was the wedding present?

408
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,570
It was six rolls of silk and rice paper.

409
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,090
But... the secret letter was included with the present.

410
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,520
You did not include the secret letter,

411
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,970
but it was found with the present because...

412
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,770
The herald you sent died on his way to the house.

413
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,880
 And someone else came to our house. 

414
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,230
 He slipped in the letter you did not write inside the present. 

415
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,810
 That face... 

416
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,100
 I definitely saw it. 

417
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,640
I definitely saw it, but...

418
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,800
 Mother! 

419
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,510
 - Father! 
 - Pull yourself together, My Lady! 

420
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,460
 Please! 

421
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,170
But I cannot seem to remember.

422
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,410
Everything got jumbled up.

423
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,970
I understand...

424
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,550
how you feel.

425
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:17,710
I cannot remember well the year

426
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,930
my brother passed as well.

427
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,150
Father was... concerned about Your Highness.

428
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,950
Because Crown Prince Ui Hyeon passed away and you took his position,

429
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,840
Father said your loneliness and pain cannot be understood by anyone,

430
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,820
and no one can take it away.

431
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,940
That is why he was worried about you.

432
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,210
I suppose people say I gave the peach to my brother.

433
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,800
They say I killed him because I wanted to become the Crown Prince.

434
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,740
Please do not say that.

435
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,950
Father did not believe rumors like that.

436
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,090
He believed in Your Highness.

437
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,230
 Are you telling me that you were not able to find any clues at all? 

438
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,400
 That is so, Your Highness. 

439
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,650
 I should have... given this to His Highness. 

440
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,270
 Their goal must be to train the Crown Prince. 

441
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,190
 They are scaring him so they can control him. 

442
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,860
 The Crown Prince is bound to be the next King, 

443
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,990
 and the King should not be too strong. 

444
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:14,170
 If... Father had a different idea like I suspected, 

445
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,660
 is this the limit to my loyalty toward His Highness? 

446
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,410
 I will step in for a moment, Father. 

447
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,490
You stayed late at the palace.

448
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,800
There is something I'd like to ask you about this object.

449
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,020
Before the government official of the department of Taoism who was involved with the celebratory message ran away,

450
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,840
he sold this at a market.

451
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,190
If so...

452
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,260
you just need to tell His Highness the truth.

453
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,390
Did you not tell His Highness?

454
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,090
How come you did not tell him?

455
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,940
Because this compass...

456
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,460
belongs to you, Father.

457
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,400
So you told a lie to His Highness.

458
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,050
Two years ago, when an ambassador from the Ming dynasty visited,

459
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,410
he gifted them only to the court subjects.

460
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,820
The three state councilors, including me, and the six ministers received one each.

461
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,970
Answer me.

462
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,990
Before you were my son,

463
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,670
you are the Sergeant of the Department of Defense who works for the country,

464
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,580
and the servant of His Highness, the Crown Prince.

465
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,310
How come... you did not tell His Highness correctly?

466
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,830
I wanted to ask you the truth first—

467
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,620
Gunshinyuui.

468
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,330
The King and his subject's relationship needs to be based on loyalty.

469
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,790
Loyalty is not just about one person's will and faith.

470
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,560
Thinking about it now, the reason High Highness does not trust you

471
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,670
was not just because of His Highness' arrogance.

472
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,450
But how could I tell High Highness about it without asking you first?

473
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,900
But...

474
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,020
since this does not belong to you,

475
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,590
I feel no longer burdened.

476
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,080
If you are attached to small things,

477
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,780
how will you... become a loyal servant?

478
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,690
If your assailant and the killer of the herald were the same person,

479
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,610
could his people have killed my family as well?

480
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,340
What is it that they want?

481
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,580
I do not understand why they sent a secret letter to my family.

482
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,470
If they wanted the rumor about the ghost's letter to be spread in the world,

483
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,320
it does not make sense

484
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,320
that they killed my family immediately after they sent the letter.

485
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,940
They definitely must have sent the secret letter to my family for a different purpose.

486
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,560
Finding out their purpose would be the way to reveal who they are.

487
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,950
 The three state councilors, including me, 

488
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,330
 and the six ministers received one each. 

489
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,290
 The Chief State Minister, Right State Minister, and the six ministers 

490
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,590
 except for my father. 

491
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:05,230
 Who among them is the owner of this compass? 

492
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,940
Did you read the report on the cases I gave you?

493
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,390
Yes.

494
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,720
I am reading it every night.

495
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,780
There will be a public discourse.

496
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,650
His Majesty ordered everyone to find a way to catch the culprit through public discourse.

497
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,610
Would I be attending as well?

498
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,540
The one in charge of those cases will be the chair for the public discourse that day.

499
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,180
The one who was betrothed to you.

500
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,570
Sergeant Han Seong On.

501
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,050
Will you be okay with that?

502
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,440
Yes.

503
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,460
I will be okay.

504
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,640
I can do it.

505
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,630
I will do it.

506
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,300
My Lady...

507
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,240
could not have met with him dressed as a eunuch, right?

508
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,800
 How beautiful, My Lady! 

509
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,600
 I guess they sell pretty shoes like these in Hanyang. 

510
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,490
 Ga Ram. 

511
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,000
 I think I'll faint out of excitement. 

512
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,250
 I cannot believe a romantic man like this exists in Joseon! 

513
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,610
 And he would become my husband! 

514
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,670
 My heart skipped a beat just now. 

515
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,930
 Wow, my heart! My heart! 

516
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,530
 I am so nervous! 

517
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,810
 Ga Ram. 

518
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,430
 - What could this be? 
 - It must be... 

519
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,370
 what they call a "love letter," My Lady! 

520
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,810
 What did he write? 

521
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:12,810
 "A heart that wants to fall in love. Would you call that love, too?" 

522
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,720
 What comes after that? 

523
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,550
 It is a secret! 

524
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,320
 Ga Ram, my dear husband is the most romantic man. 

525
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,450
 Our future in Hanyang is guaranteed to be smooth! 

526
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,770
 Our path will be covered with silk! 

527
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,890
 Would you like to slide down the silk path with me, then? 

528
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,700
 Of course, My Lady. 

529
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,100
 Your destiny is my destiny! 

530
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,540
 I'll slide down with you! 

531
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,840
 When I go to Hanyang to get married, 

532
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,650
 I will ask my dear husband 

533
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,010
 to find you a husband first. 

534
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,690
 Really? 

535
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,360
 Someone like him 

536
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,070
 will treat you like a sister and look after you. 

537
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,020
 He is definitely not someone who would be rude to someone who's dear to me. 

538
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,880
 Look at these shoes. 

539
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,150
 How could I wear such pretty shoes? 

540
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,630
 Try them on, My Lady. 

541
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,980
 Look how perfectly they fit. 

542
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,560
 They are so pretty, My Lady! 

543
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,800
 I can see the silk path! 

544
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,920
 Yes! 

545
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,530
She was so happy.

546
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,360
I cannot believe she ended up this way.

547
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,360
Goodness!

548
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,580
 The one in charge of those cases 

549
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,890
 will be the chair for the public discourse that day. 

550
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,380
 The one who was betrothed to you. 

551
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,110
 Sergeant Han Seong On. 

552
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,880
 Are you okay? 

553
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,300
 Make sure to watch where you are going. 

554
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,540
Your Highness, where are you going, exactly?

555
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,840
You were walking around everywhere for about 30 minutes.

556
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,940
Please tell me.

557
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,810
I will take you to that place.

558
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,150
This is my destination.

559
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,620
I am thinking of going back and forth on this path today.

560
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,030
I am asking the reason why.

561
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:59,260
I heard the Sergeant will be leading the public discourse over there at the palace today.

562
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,220
And Your Highness?

563
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,420
That is why I am walking back and forth.

564
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,620
Do you need to say something to Sergeant Han?

565
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,090
If so, I will send someone to summon him...

566
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,180
I mean...

567
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,840
It is not like that.

568
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,640
I want to walk back and forth here and run into him by chance!

569
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,310
I want to meet with him by chance.

570
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,190
Sergeant was already at the palace.

571
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:28,400
What did you say?

572
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,830
Why are you telling me that now?

573
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,800
- I need to go to the palace now. 
 - Your Highness! Your Highness!

574
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,700
You cannot, Your Highness.

575
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,970
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

576
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,470
- You cannot! 
 - You cannot, Your Highness!

577
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:43,990
Right? I cannot, right?

578
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,060
Let us go.

579
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,240
Here comes Your Highness, the Crown Prince!

580
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,330
Welcome, Your Highness.

581
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,550
Did you prepare well?

582
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,360
I am looking forward to today's discourse.

583
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,210
I will not let you down.

584
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,120
I am looking forward to it.

585
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,740
   

586
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,730
   

587
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,540
Today's discourse was going to be on The Great Ming Code,

588
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,860
but His Majesty was concerned about public safety

589
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,880
due to continuous heinous crimes. So His Majesty

590
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,640
himself ordered us to discuss these cases during this

591
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,250
discourse in order to find a way to solve them.

592
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,440
That is why we are here today.

593
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,670
So if anyone has an opinion on these cases,

594
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,790
feel free to tell us about it.

595
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,930
I am sure everyone has heard about the three

596
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:00,550
murder cases in the Hanyang area recently.

597
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,020
The first case happened 15 days ago at a tavern near Heoyeonbang

598
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,680
 around 5 in the morning. 

599
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,370
 The victim was a merchant 

600
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,120
 and he died from a contusion on the back. 

601
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,650
What's unique is that the culprit carved a character on the victim's abdomen after the killing.

602
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,710
He wrote the character "Song."

603
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,350
The second case happened five days ago near Sukjeong Gate around seven at night.

604
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,270
 The victim was a snake hunter. 

605
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,620
 The direct cause of death was a contusion on the chest. 

606
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,210
The first and the second victim have never met each other,

607
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:36,310
and their wives do not have anything in common, either.

608
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,110
So we treated those cases separately. However...

609
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,800
However, another person died yesterday.

610
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,740
I am serious! I really saw that body!

611
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,920
I saw it myself!

612
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,320
Seriously!

613
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,510
Why do you not believe me?

614
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,070
Did you really see that body?

615
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,440
Why would I have told a lie? 
    

616
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,300
His whole body was drenched from the blood that came out of his neck wound.

617
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,110
Gosh! Thinking about how scared I was... Gosh!

618
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:11,000
I thought I would die at the pharmacy while trying to get an ointment for myself. 
    

619
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,620
Is it true that the victim was Old Man Kim, the rug weaver?

620
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,900
Yes!

621
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,990
Gosh! His youngest daughter has not found someone to marry yet.

622
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,380
He was such a nice person!

623
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,980
 I know! 

624
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,140
 Gosh! 

625
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,670
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

626
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,010
By the way, do you know what is worse?

627
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:36,230
Yesterday, I overheard the soldiers talking while putting the body away.

628
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,500
The culprit apparently wrote...

629
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,250
a character on Old Man Kim's back.

630
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,050
A character?

631
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,670
Myeol! Myeol!

632
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:49,780
It was the character Myeol, which means "destroy."

633
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,120
 My goodness! 

634
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,360
 Oh, my goodness! 

635
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,710
 Gosh! 

636
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,730
 What is he doing? 

637
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,760
These cases do not seem to be related at a glance, but...

638
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,490
- Serial murders. 
 - Are they serial murders?

639
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,210
They are clearly serial murders.

640
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,860
What makes you think so?

641
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,860
First of all, on the bodies of the first and the third victim,

642
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:28,340
the characters "Song" and "Myeol" were written separately.

643
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,840
I almost ruled out the second victim since a character was not found on the body,

644
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,230
but I found something in common with the other two cases.

645
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,220
Which is that all the victims were...

646
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,520
senior citizens.

647
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:44,330
I will call this case "Sabangahn" 
  (T/N: Referring to four different directions) 

648
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,800
from now on.

649
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,480
The first murder took place at a tavern near Heoyeonbang. Therefore, South.

650
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,540
The second one was at a small temple near Sujeong Gate. Therefore, North.

651
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,480
The third one was at a pharmacy near Seoso Gate. Therefore, West.

652
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,290
- What is left is– 
 - East.

653
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,330
According to Sergeant Han,

654
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,920
serial murders are happening in each direction.

655
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,590
If so, does it mean the culprit

656
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,580
has not finished his murders?

657
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,060
Yes.

658
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,400
According to the pattern, his last victim will be

659
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,860
found in the East, near Heungin Gate.

660
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,960
It is highly likely that it will be around Geondeokbang and Chamseonbang.

661
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,310
Also, the culprit took the risk of being seen

662
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,160
by carving characters on two bodies.

663
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,340
It looks like a murder ritual with a purpose.

664
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,780
Therefore...

665
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,880
the culprit is definitely superstitious.

666
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,130
Since all three victims were senior citizens, the victim on the East side

667
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,670
will highly likely be a senior citizen as well.

668
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,550
You sound persuasive.

669
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,720
If you allow us, we will send out the soldiers and protect the senior citizens on the East side,

670
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,730
and catch the culprit.

671
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,870
Does anyone have a different opinion than Sergeant?

672
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,270
Soon Dol, what do you think?

673
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:28,660
I am sure you all heard about the strange case at the military training hunting grounds.

674
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,980
This is the person who solved the mystery of the celebratory message.

675
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,300
I will give you a chance.

676
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,110
Do not hesitate to share your thought.

677
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,160
 I shall not hold back. 

678
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,220
 There is no way my betroth will recognize me now. 

679
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,820
I also think these are serial murders.

680
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:57,560
I also agree with Sergeant that the culprit is likely to be superstitious. However...

681
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:03,020
I cannot agree that the murders are taking place in four directions.

682
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,150
Sergeant's theory is wrong?

683
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,150
What is your reason?

684
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,100
We need to find the meaning of the characters on the bodies first.

685
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,410
I am sure there is a clue that you missed on the second body.

686
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,310
If we investigate that again, we can find the exact pattern—

687
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,030
What if the murder happens on the East side?

688
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:27,740
Are you certain that it will not be on the East side?

689
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,710
If we end up with another victim by doing nothing,

690
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:34,320
can you take responsibility and bring him back to life?

691
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,680
Do you not find the dates suspicious, Sergeant?

692
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,460
- What? 
 - If the culprit chose the murder sites

693
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:45,880
based on superstitious belief, he probably did not choose just any date, either.

694
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,650
Your Highness, I think I can find out where the next murder will take place.

695
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:08,180
A book about lucky dates and directions?

696
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,720
Yes, please allow me to check its calendar.

697
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:13,960
   

698
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,420
   

699
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,720
   

700
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,430
- Bring the calendar here. 
 - Yes.

701
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:22,990
That is not necessary.

702
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,690
His theory makes perfect sense.

703
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,960
According to the calendar, the next murder will happen on the West side,

704
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,240
not the East side, like what Sergeant said.

705
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,600
That is correct.

706
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,370
And if it really is based on the calendar, the next lucky day is six days after.

707
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,510
That is a big problem, then. Let us release the soldiers immediately and...

708
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,270
Your Highness.

709
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,500
Even if he were right, we still do not know who our suspect is.

710
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,370
That is why we need to investigate further.

711
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:57,300
In order to find our suspect, we need to look into the remaining clue, the characters on the bodies.

712
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,900
Your Highness, I said the second body does not have a character on it.

713
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,740
Please allow me to check again. There must be something he missed.

714
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,690
The reason why he took the risk by carving characters on the bodies is

715
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,280
his motive for these murders.

716
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,150
We need to question his motive after we arrest him.

717
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,410
What is more important is to prevent the fourth murder.

718
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,560
That is what I am trying to do. A person's life depends on it.

719
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,030
We cannot waste a moment.

720
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:24,020
Even if you check the body again,

721
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,310
there is no guarantee that you will figure out the meaning of the characters.

722
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,500
What if you end up wasting time by investigating?

723
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,110
Your Highness, even if we go to the Western side of the capital, as he said,

724
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,220
we have yet to find the suspect.

725
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,400
So we must protect everyone in the area.

726
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,220
However, that is impossible.

727
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:47,460
I will go to the East side and make sure to prevent the fourth murder.

728
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,850
- Sergeant! 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

729
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:06,690
Send a signal to the Eastern office to tighten security.

730
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:13,080
Also, Sergeant Han Seong On will form an army of fifth-degree soldiers and be in charge of security in East Hanyang.

731
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,340
I will follow your order.

732
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,320
Also, Eunuch Go Soon Dol will do a second investigation on the body

733
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,390
and complete your theory.

734
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,990
Yes!

735
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,690
Since murder was predicted, time is our worst enemy.

736
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,800
Let us conclude the discourse now.

737
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,830
   

738
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:02,650
Sergeant , His Highness made you compete against some lowly eunuch.

739
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,740
   

740
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,540
Good work.

741
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,240
Your Highness.

742
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,790
Did you summon me?

743
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,610
- Look for Doctrine of the Mean. 
 - Pardon?

744
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,970
Do you want to read Doctrine of the Mean?

745
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:07,910
There are many books. If you tell me where it might be around...

746
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:10,610
You cannot. No, I am sure you cannot.

747
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:15,720
You have every book in your head.Why are you looking for Doctrine of the Mean all of a sudden?

748
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:22,080
Should I find the book and bring it to the Eastern Palace?

749
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,410
Come on. What a rude bastard...

750
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,810
What is your mouth for? Why will you not speak?

751
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,240
Where is it?

752
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,970
Found it!

753
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:45,370
♫  When the quiet sound of wind approaches one step closer  ♫

754
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:52,290
♫  A stranger who brushed against my clothes  ♫

755
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:57,720
 Although I never miss the opportunity to be proud, I never miss the opportunity to compliment someone. 

756
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,140
 Also... I never miss the opportunity to award someone, either. 

757
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,640
 The apple is an award for doing well during the discourse. 

758
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,040
 It's a precious apple all the way from Daegu. 

759
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,660
♫  Without even realizing...  ♫

760
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,820
What a strange person.

761
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,320
Is he actually affectionate?

762
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,940
Crown Prince, I take back calling you a rude bastard.

763
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:34,910
♫  What should I do with my heart?  ♫

764
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,230
His Highness, who's so picky with people,

765
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,200
brought someone new into the Eastern Palace?

766
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,380
Tell our man at the Eunuch's Office to find out what kind of person

767
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,070
Go Soon Dol, the eunuch of the Eastern Palace, is.

768
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,510
Yes.

769
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,330
You will have to catch the culprit, no matter what.

770
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,600
Do not become a laughingstock to that lowly eunuch.

771
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,450
Go Soon Dol!

772
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,130
Was the apple...

773
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,500
tasty?

774
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,730
Yes.

775
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,970
It was... very tasty.

776
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,500
♫  It was just for a moment  ♫

777
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:25,170
♫  On the day we smiled together  ♫

778
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:31,000
♫  I must've fallen like a leaf  ♫

779
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:40,680
♫  You understand my heart as if it is sick  ♫

780
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:48,640
♫  Because of that moment, I still...  ♫

781
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,820
♫  The wind warms my life  ♫

782
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,240
   

783
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,810
 I will send another person there tomorrow. 

784
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:04,090
 - How strange. 
 - This might get really bad, Master! 

785
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,500
 Is it because of the ghost's letter? 

786
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,560
 I'm sure he did not die. 

787
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,600
 I will make sure to solve it! 

788
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,320
 Why did he have to do that? 

789
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,670
 You dared to lie to me, and now you are asking me what to do? 

790
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,940
 It is against the law. 

791
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,900
 I figured out the pattern of the murders! 

792
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:30,400
♫  Even if I fill it with you...  ♫
