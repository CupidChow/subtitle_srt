1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,450
   

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,320
   

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,160
   

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,520
   

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,470
   

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,960
   

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,940
   

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,900
   

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:45,010


10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,390
Your Highness, Your Highness!

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,160
Chase him.

12
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,630
You must catch him

13
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,450
and show that

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,170
it was the work of people.

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,410
Your Highness, Your Highness!

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,050
Wake up, Your Highness!

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,890
Find the man who shot the arrow. We must catch him!

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,510
 Yes, Sir! 

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,240
Your Highness! Your Highness...

20
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,870
There is nobody in the upper area.

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,190
Search carefully. He will not have made it out of the hunting grounds yet.

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,730
 Yes, Sir! 

23
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,860
 If there are two Tae Kangs, one can shoot an arrow at the Crown Prince, 

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,920
Please wake up, Your Highness...

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,960
 and the other could be by the Crown Prince's side. 

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,450
They are twins.

27
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,130
That is right.

28
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,230
If they are twins, that is possible.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,180
Should we tell His Highness that the Guardian Warrior has a twin?

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,640
Sir, where should we put this?

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,950
Place the cauldron in the kitchen.

32
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,030
Move it carefully.

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,230
Glue the paper weather strips carefully, so no wind passes through.

34
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,190
- You have to attach the door properly so it does not fall off.
 - Yes, Sir.

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,710
It is late at night, so hurry.

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,560
- Put it down. 
 - Two, three.

37
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,570
Your Highness.

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,540
From here, you must walk.

39
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,430
   

40
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,240
Please go in. I will be guarding the front.

41
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,610
Let us go.

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,920
I am sorry that I had noble guests, such as yourselves, come all the way here.

43
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,340
It is okay.

44
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,570
We ended up here because we had a particular situation, so please excuse us.

45
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,070
By chance, have you heard about us?

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,870
I am a wanderer, but I am capable of reading physiognomy.

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,810
You have a nobility about you that cannot be hidden.

48
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,220
Please let the Young Master and I have some time by ourselves.

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,070
Your Highness,

50
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,580
I am sorry, but I need to use the outhouse.

51
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,930
- Please be quick. 
 - Y-Yes, Your Highness.

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,540
 If that Guardian Warrior really has a twin, 

53
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,140
then is that not a major problem?

54
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,860
One person is beside the Crown Prince,

55
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,870
but the other with the same face is involved in all these terrible incidents.

56
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,980
- Would they not be on the same side? 
 - That cannot be.

57
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,910
Does the Guardian Warrior know that he has a twin?

58
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,700
If they were separated at a young age, he might not know.

59
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,830
That is something we can check in time.

60
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,800
Eunuch Go, did you not say you solved a mystery?

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,980
What is it?

62
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,560
It has to do with these peony petals.

63
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,110
Revered Goddess of Mercy...

64
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,720
Shim Young firmly believed up to the last moment he took his own life

65
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,630
that he was Min Jae Yi's secret lover.

66
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,520
How could such blind faith be possible?

67
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,060
That is what I mean. Unless he was possessed by a ghostâ€”

68
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,670
He was not possessed by a ghost but was influenced by something else.

69
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,810
In the Ming Dynasty, there was something called opium.

70
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,530
I have met a merchant who said he went to the other end of the continent.

71
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,790
Supposedly, Western merchants brought in opium ever since the Tang Dynasty,

72
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,440
and you can still purchase it.

73
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,830
- I have heard of that. 
 - I have heard of it, too.

74
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,070
If you eat it, you start to lose your mind and you cannot even recognize your parents.

75
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,010
Is it something you eat?

76
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,950
I do not know about that.

77
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,230
But I heard you cannot tell if you are dead or alive if you are under the influence of opium.

78
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,890
If the peony flowers are similar to the opium I had heard about,

79
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,910
I wonder if he made Shim Young think that he was Min Jae Yi's secret lover

80
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,370
while he was under the influence of the peony petal fragrance.

81
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,360
What is causing you so much pain?

82
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
 Grandfather! 

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,580
 My great-uncle gave me peaches. 

84
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,810
 I gave that to my Elder Hyungnim. 

85
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,150
 After he ate that peach, 

86
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,440
the Elder Hyungnim

87
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,430
passed away.

88
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,670
Are you talking about hypnosis?

89
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,210
I have read in books that there are those who perform hypnosis.

90
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,610
What is that?

91
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,080
It is where one causes someone to grow confused and delusional,

92
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,940
plant false thoughts.

93
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,680
Grand Prince, you have never

94
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,910
given Crown Prince Ui Hyeon a peach.

95
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,330
Yes.

96
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,600
I have never given him a peach.

97
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,580
Crown Prince Ui Hyeon eating a peach and passing away

98
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,290
is also just a false rumor in the palace.

99
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,170
It is just a false rumor.

100
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,170
Now your painful memories will disappear.

101
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,420
All your memories of being afraid will disappear as well.

102
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,620
If you burn peony petals and perform hypnosis,

103
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,420
it is possible to control people's minds?

104
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,910
And Shim Young was also mind-controlled like that as well?

105
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,310
 I have returned. 

106
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,440
 The Song family did not forget the unjust deaths and sorrow of the people of Byeokcheon. 

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,090
 I will take this country's throne! 

108
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,360
 I will take this country's throne. 

109
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,650
The head shaman! The head shaman was the same.

110
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,480
As if she was possessed by something,

111
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
she appeared to believe she had received a prophecy about the Song family.

112
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
So he used peony petals and hypnosis

113
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
to implant false thoughts into people's minds

114
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,470
to make them believe it as truth.

115
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,960
This is our speculation without clear evidence.

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,820
But Master, your master said that

117
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,620
the peony petals were only used to calm people down.

118
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,160
Do you think he would know everything that exists in India?

119
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,260
I know the etiquette as a lady, but I have a situation that I have called you,

120
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,640
so please do not be offended, Sergeant.

121
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,270
Please speak, Your Highness.

122
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,140
I need to ask a difficult favor of you.

123
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,510
You may give me your orders.

124
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,140
I must leave the palace with the Grand Prince tonight.

125
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,850
Why are you thinking of heading out of the palace at night?

126
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,480
The Grand Prince has a psychological trauma that the physician has been treating,

127
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,410
but no matter what we do, he does not get better.

128
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,900
So, I want to take him outside of the palace to treat him with hypnosis.

129
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,780
Your Highness, why are you trying to do what is prohibited by national law?

130
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,400
Sergeant, please do not ask me any other questions.

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,760
I did not come to this conclusion easily.

132
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,530
I decided this for the Grand Prince's well-being.

133
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:46,820
However, if something were to happen to the Grand Prince while we secretly left the palace,

134
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,590
how could I handle the consequences?

135
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,690
- Your Highness. 
 - I am begging you.

136
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,170
You are the only one I could think of, Sergeant.

137
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,720
Could you please protect Grand Prince and me tonight?

138
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,730
Are you all right?

139
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,820
Court Lady Kwon, are you all right? Court Lady Kwon!

140
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,850
The door over there...

141
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,740
No! You should not go! It is dangerous.

142
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,690
Court Lady Kwon.

143
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,940
 You usually burn incense on this burner. 

144
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,410
 But I thought it was strange that there were dried flowers in it. 

145
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,570
- Who are you? 
 - Did you just ask who I am?

146
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,970
I am the one who has seen everything.

147
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,700
I have seen the land turn red

148
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,680
with the blood of the people due to the greed of rulers and aristocrats.

149
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,060
I have seen the despair of the people you have abandoned,

150
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,400
and their blood and tears.

151
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,680
From the nobility to lowly slaves,

152
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,490
is there any life that is not precious under heaven?

153
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,700
And yet, how could I just stand around and watch your wicked sins

154
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,350
of cutting off the tongues of innocent people and

155
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,710
declaring them as criminals and even taking away their barren land?

156
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:35,180
I dared shed blood with these holy hands,

157
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:41,980
but since peace for the people is more important than Buddhahood, I have no regrets.

158
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,790
Stop making excuses and tell me your objective.

159
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,370
What have you done to the Grand Prince, and why did you try to harm the Princess?

160
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,510
I have one objective. Song Family...

161
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,540
Destroy Yi!

162
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,240
The Yi family will perish, and a true man of the Song Family will soon appear

163
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,920
and start a new dynasty.

164
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,800
It is only then that hierarchical order and social classism will disappear

165
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,460
and true...

166
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,740
utopia will...

167
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,920
finally... come!

168
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,860
 A woman frequented the Shamanist Bureau. 

169
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,580
 I think she visited whenever the head shaman came back from the temple in Gaeseong. 

170
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,770
 I could not see her face because she was wearing a veil. 

171
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,350
   

172
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,240
This is extremely dangerous, Friend.

173
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,830
More than a couple of people are part of their group.

174
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,140
They have access to the palace and the Royal Investigation Bureau,

175
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,030
have contempt for the royal family, murdered the entire family of the Governor,

176
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,980
and even dared to attack the Crown Princeâ€“

177
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,630
by shooting an arrow at him.

178
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,350
We must find out who is behind them.

179
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,190
 

180
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,130
The head shaman's prayer site is in Gaeseong?

181
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,540
Why are you telling me this now?

182
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,430
Also, while investigating the traces of the Byeokcheon case,

183
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,660
we've discovered that the Byeokcheon people left for Gaeseong

184
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,730
after saying they were going back to their hometown.

185
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,780
Also, there were eyewitness accounts of some sending various goods

186
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,850
to Gaeseong, saying they were sending them to their hometown.

187
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,450
Then are you saying that their base is in Gaeseong?

188
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,220
I am not sure yet,

189
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,820
but a lot is pointing at both Gaeseong and Byeokcheon simultaneously.

190
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,970
The head shaman was also from Byeokcheon.

191
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,000
The people who were forced out of their hometown live together in Gaeseong?

192
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,540
If so, would Gaeseong people not know of the village where Byeokcheon people live together?

193
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,690
Rumors about it would have spread already.

194
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,820
By chance, what if they are living in hiding?

195
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,630
And that is why they are sending goods over there.

196
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,480
If they buy what they need on Gaeseong streets, their base could be discovered.

197
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,270
Since Mt. Songak is precipitous,

198
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,640
it is possible to form a village in a valley and live there in hiding.

199
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,840
But all of this is a hypothesis.

200
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,770
But when we are in the dark, hypotheses are also important.

201
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,760
If we start from hypotheses and eliminate many of them, we can arrive at the truth.

202
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,840
Whoa! As expected of Eunuch Go!

203
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,170
All right, then, my student.

204
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,970
What are you doing? Please tell them.

205
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,920
My master told me this morning that from today on,

206
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,810
we need to form an investigation team to investigate those cases systematically.

207
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,970
The name is...

208
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,340
Master chose the name as he pleased.

209
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,750
It's Shield Investigation Team...

210
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,340
- Shield Investigation Team... 
 - What does that mean?

211
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:29,760
It means that we are shields that protect the Crown Prince with our whole body!

212
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,800
- I will be the leader of the team. 
 - But wait... who says you can be the leader?

213
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,190
I said so. It's my Manyeondang.

214
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,820
I am the one who provides this precious space as our team's base.

215
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,540
So why can I not be the leader?

216
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,070
I also considered all night about our future.

217
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,290
- Are you bragging about something so minor? 
 - Something minor?

218
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,060
If you can become the leader for something like this, let us move our base.

219
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,790
I will prepare an even better place for us.

220
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,690
Even so, how could we allow someone who cannot even use a shovel to become a leader?

221
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,650
One day, I will show you how well I shovel.

222
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,270
Anyway, I am the leader. I am the leader, no matter what!

223
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,380
Yeah, tell His Highness as well.

224
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,590
I, Myung Jin, am the leader of the Shield Investigation Team.

225
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,390
Well. Sure. Go ahead, go ahead.

226
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,400
Gosh. I do not obsess over becoming a leader, so I will just be the youngest one.

227
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,150
In return, please call me the "golden maknae."

228
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
 Then I will take secondâ€“ 

229
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,560
I will take third.

230
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,640
Then we should tell the Crown Prince and investigate the Guardian Warrior first.

231
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,960
I do not know if it is his older or younger brother,

232
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,440
but that Guardian Warrior's twin is involved in all of these cases,

233
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,220
so we should be able to find out a lot from him.

234
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,300
Shield!

235
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,440
Your Highness!

236
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,030
Go and call the physician. Also, tell the Queen's Palace.

237
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,130
- Yes, Sir. 
 - You must move secretly.

238
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,020
This must not leak outside the palace.

239
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,080
Are you all right?

240
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,360
Only a stab wound on my side...

241
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,690
I am fine.

242
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,860
You took the Princess and the Grand Princess there.

243
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,060
He tried to harm the Princess and you.

244
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,770
- How do you know the man who died? 
 - I just...

245
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,230
heard some court maids talking about

246
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,100
a spiritual monk who helps to heal emotional trauma.

247
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,920
I would never have imagined this would happen...

248
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,510
Sergeant, Court Lady Kwon needs to be treated as well.

249
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,470
If that incense burner with peony petals really induces hypnosis...

250
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,190
did you not smell that incense as well?

251
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,130
I just do not have a clear memory of the events,

252
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,100
but I do not have false memories.

253
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,650
What differentiates me from the head shaman and Shim Young is that I smelled the incense

254
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,090
but no one performed hypnosis on me.

255
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,200
However, Ga Ram said she saw the master of Manyeondang Young Master

256
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,000
at our house in Gaeseong.

257
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,450
Are you saying he and Shim Young knew each other?

258
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,600
Shim Young killed your family under hypnosis.

259
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,090
If that man met Shim Young at your house in Gaeseong, would that be a coincidence?

260
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,640
 These are... nothing special. 

261
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,860
 They are commonly used incense made for helping someone relax. 

262
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,680
 We must find out more about that man. 

263
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,570
He might also be a part of that group.

264
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,080
But did you really not know that the Guardian Warrior had a twin?

265
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,090
You already have the entire list of the Royal Bodyguard Unit memorized.

266
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,560
Kang was adopted.

267
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,350
Thus, I cannot confirm his birth from just the records of the list.

268
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,560
If we investigate the Guardian Warrior's parents,

269
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,010
we can find out where and how they came to adopt him.

270
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,450
Kang's adoptive father was a Charity and Medical Services Unit constable.

271
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,090
The ones who entrusted Kang to them were Sergeant and me.

272
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,770
- Pardon? 
 - I first met Kang ten years ago.

273
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,400
Let us go over there.

274
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,990
- Which cup is it under? 
 - Just move the cups.

275
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,680
Come on, be a bit patient, boss.

276
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,870
It is right here. Look closely.

277
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,960
- Choose one! 
 - Here!

278
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,010
As expected, you guys are good at betting.

279
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,600
Hey! Catch him!

280
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,140
Your limbs are fine, and you have talent, so why are you living like that?

281
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,450
What is wrong with how I live?

282
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,440
What is wrong with living off my abilities without begging for money?

283
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,400
How dare you! Is making a living by pickpocketing using your own abilities?

284
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,440
Lead the way. Where is your house?

285
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,290
I must meet your parents and tell them what you have done.

286
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,430
If I had parents, do you think I would live like this?

287
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,490
I am your mother from now on.

288
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,680
 Master Myeongdo said to the royal court, "Rule the nation 

289
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:44,730
 but on the foundations of correcting customs and acquiring talented people." 

290
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,430
   

291
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,710
   

292
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,450
 Did you really pass the military service exam? 

293
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,440
 I am proud of you. 

294
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,370
 I will never forget this debt. 

295
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,500
 If I did not meet you two, I would probably still be 

296
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,490
 living the life of a rascal on the streets. 

297
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,530
 No. Kang, you would have 

298
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,240
 lived an upright life, even if it was not for us. 

299
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,800
 That is the type of person I have seen you to be. 

300
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,850
 He was definitely Tae Kang. 

301
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,300
 What is going on? 

302
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,050
 How could Kang do something like that... 

303
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,910
He said that he wandered without knowing his hometown or his parents' faces.

304
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,650
So Kang probably does not know that he has a twin, either.

305
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,360
Perhaps the Guardian Warrior's hometown is Byeokcheon.

306
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,150
Since his twin brother is moving on behalf of Byeokcheon, his hometown is also probably Byeokcheon,

307
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,200
which means the Guardian Warrior is also from Byeokcheon.

308
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,890
On the one hand, I do think that it is a relief.

309
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,040
- What do you mean? 
 - If our deductions are correct,

310
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,720
the Guardian Warrior would have nothing to do with my family's death,

311
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,670
and did not attack you, either, Your Highness.

312
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,050
However, the Guardian Warrior's twin shot an arrow at you,

313
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,340
and killed the herald you had sent, Your Highness.

314
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,840
If he is in and out of the palace with the same face as the Guardian Warrior,

315
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,420
this would be terribleâ€“

316
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,230
Your Highness, I went to the Eastern Palace, and they told me you were here.

317
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:59,020
- What is the matter? 
 - You ordered me to go to the house near Tongun Bridge.

318
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,500
I got it ready as you ordered.

319
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,670
Great work.

320
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,620
Sir, why are you in that attire...

321
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,700
I had a situation. It is urgent. Tell him I am here.

322
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,590
His Highness is not at the Eastern Palace right now.

323
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,260
He said he would read at the library tonight.

324
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,430
The Guardian Warrior also went to the library to see His Highness just now.

325
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,140
Kang went to His Highness?

326
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,310
Your Highness, I am sorry for not wearing my proper attire.

327
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,770
How could you stand here perfectly fine?

328
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,390
Your Highness, could I check the Guardian Warrior's body for something that just took place?

329
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,880
What do you mean, something that just took place?

330
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,540
Where were you four hours ago?

331
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,120
Pardon?

332
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,680
Kang was near Tongun Bridge at that time.

333
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,920
That is not true, Your Highness.

334
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,040
Guardian Warrior was at a small temple in Mt. Surak.

335
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,350
What are you talking about?

336
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,580
I was at a house near Tongun Bridge per His Highness's order.

337
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,780
- Quite a few people were there with me, soâ€“ 
 - That is not true, Your Highness.

338
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,860
Please make the Guardian Warrior bare his shoulders.

339
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,750
You just injured your left shoulder by being slashed by a sword.

340
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,410
It is not Kang.

341
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,440
Your Highness.

342
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,170
Show your left shoulder to the Sergeant.

343
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,480
This is an order, so obey.

344
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,080
Sir, why are you behaving this way to me?

345
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,100
I am sure I saw your face!

346
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,470
Just four hours ago, did you not point a sword at me?

347
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,430
 I clearly saw your face at my house in Gaeseong. 

348
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,650
 I definitely saw you near the Royal Kitchen. 

349
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:26,450
By chance, while His Highness was confined, did you meet the Young Master of Manyeondang on the streets?

350
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,660
I have not.

351
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,260
However, the Young Master said he definitely saw the Guardian Warrior in disguise.

352
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,690
By chance,

353
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,260
do you have a twin?

354
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,600
Answer me. I asked if you have a twin.

355
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,750
No, Your Highness.

356
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,460
No, I do not.

357
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,860
- Kang, please leave. 
 - Your Highness.

358
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,840
I will call you back later, so leave for now.

359
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,390
Your Highness, does Kang have a twin?

360
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,170
Kang does not seem to know that he has a twin.

361
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,980
Did the man you encountered at the small temple in Mt. Surak have Kang's face?

362
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,770
Why did you go there?

363
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,140
Was he injured by your sword?

364
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,860
Even if they are twins, they look so identical.

365
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,160
Are you talking about San?

366
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,110
I thought he was San.

367
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,160
He would not know in his wildest dreams that his hyung is still alive, right?

368
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,110
But did not his clothes look like that of a government official?

369
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,140
Why was he loitering around Manyeondang?

370
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,100
You do not know what San and the monk are plotting?

371
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,810
- When you went to the Shamanist Bureauâ€“ 
 - Be quiet!

372
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,790
When are you going back home?

373
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,430
I had a dream where

374
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,100
animals were digging Oh Wol's grave.

375
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
We buried her without even a tombstone or a casket.

376
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,760
I do not know if we could even find her grave.

377
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,250
Go inside now.

378
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,060
Please watch Dal Rae and Meo Roo falling asleep.

379
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,480
Well, sir. Take care then.

380
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,350
Okay.

381
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,870
Let's go. Lead the way.

382
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,990
- Are you not going home? 
 - It is dangerous at night.

383
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,830
So?

384
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,760
Come on! It is because I am worried.

385
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,490
- Let me walk to your house. 
 - Why, all of a sudden?

386
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:16,430
Come on! It is a scholar's duty to protect someone weak and small!

387
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,910
Gosh. Why are you calling me weak anyway?

388
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:24,920
What? What is it? What is it?

389
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,170
Just now, a ghost...

390
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,230
- No, a goblin's hand... 
 - G-Goblin...

391
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,220
I could feel it touching my neck!

392
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,570
You're so easily scared.

393
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,420
How would you walk alone on this dark street?

394
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,880
Do you not feel protected... because I am standing in front of you?

395
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,410
Yes, Sir.

396
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,550
I feel protected.

397
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,670
It is this way!

398
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,850
So Princess and Grand Prince are safe?

399
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,930
Yes. The two of them returned safely.

400
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,710
It looked like the Grand Prince fell asleep comfortably, but...

401
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,630
Your Highness.

402
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,840
I saw the same incense burner as the one at the shaman's house at the temple.

403
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,410
Also, the words he said were...

404
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,000
 Song Family... 

405
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,090
 Destroy Yi. 

406
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:58,990
 The Yi family will perish, and a true man of the Song Family will soon appear and start a new dynasty. 

407
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,620
 It is only then that... 

408
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,350
 the true utopia will... 

409
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,510
How strange is that?

410
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,350
What did that man look like?

411
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,750
He was wearing a gray monk's robe but had long gray hair down.

412
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,290
He did not appear to be a legitimate monk.

413
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,800
But he said he got converted on his own and mentioned the true utopia.

414
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,200
He might be a vagabond, but he must have studied Buddhism at some point.

415
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,760
He was with Gang's twin.

416
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,420
And if he mentioned Song Family Destroy Yi, he was definitely involved with the head shaman.

417
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,310
What did you do with his body?

418
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,830
I told someone trustworthy to remove the incense burner and the body.

419
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,930
We could check the body as soon as the day breaks.

420
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,310
   

421
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,810
   

422
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,470
Remove the incense.

423
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,240
Sergeant directly ordered us to secure it.

424
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,800
We need to keep everything inside of it, too.

425
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
Yes, Sir!

426
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,650
Your Highness, I do not know how to tell you this.

427
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,210
When Head Shaman was committing murders,

428
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,280
I said there was a woman who frequented the Shamanist Bureau.

429
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,720
The woman in a veil.

430
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,570
Court Lady Kwon wore a veil when she went to the temple today.

431
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:04,520
Court Lady Kwon, wearing a veil, took Princess and Grand Prince to a place where blood was shed.

432
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,830
I need to ask Princess why she left the palace.

433
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:12,530
 The Grand Prince has been saying nonsense like seeing a ghost and a snake, and now 

434
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,460
 he says he gave a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon. 

435
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,140
 How could everything that he says be true? 

436
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,400
Grand Prince must have had his reason.

437
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,970
I need to visit him in his bedchamber.

438
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,740
Did he... really die like that?

439
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:39,860
Sergeant... removed Tae San's mask and saw his face.

440
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,680
Sergeant went to see the Crown Prince.

441
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,140
He must have told him about Tae San's face.

442
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,720
Your Highness.

443
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,410
The Crown Prince will come.

444
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,260
You know nothing about what happened.

445
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,640
If something goes wrong,

446
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,470
I will take all the blame.

447
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,090
Do not say that. You need to live.

448
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,150
You need to live and go back to your hometown.

449
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,140
It is not important for a lowly woman like me to survive.

450
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,290
You have to be safe so Grand Prince will be put on the throne.

451
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,450
That way, everyone can go back home.

452
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:25,200
Think about the people of Baekcheon who depend on you and the Grand Prince.

453
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,240
They are hiding in Naean Village

454
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,700
while waiting for the day they can return to their hometown.

455
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,670
You must be strong, Your Highness.

456
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,070
Let me take care of the rest.

457
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,490
Go to your living quarters and take care of yourself.

458
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,570
Grand Prince is just in a deep sleep.

459
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,030
His pulse and breathing are normal.

460
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,390
You do not have to worry.

461
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,890
You may leave now.

462
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,420
What made you leave the palace?

463
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,660
I heard Grand Prince cannot sleep

464
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,600
since he secretly saw the head shaman's interrogation.

465
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,170
He is not just your brother. He is mine, also.

466
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,470
If you decide to do something for him,

467
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,460
I must know about it as well.

468
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,280
 Her Highness the Queen is here. 

469
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,780
I just heard the news.

470
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,270
How could this have happened?

471
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,970
He is just asleep now.

472
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,270
He will wake up, right?

473
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,680
Most certainly.

474
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,840
I am sorry for making you worry, Mother.

475
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,030
I am relieved that you are safe as well.

476
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,490
Tell me,

477
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,000
for what reason did you leave the palace with your little brother?

478
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,330
I need to know why, so I can catch those people.

479
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,700
What would have happened to you and Grand Prince if Sergeant was not there?

480
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,860
He tried to attack you with a sword.

481
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,760
You saw the man who tried to kill Grand Prince killing himself in front of Sergeant.

482
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,020
The two of them were on the same side.

483
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,550
Do you not understand?

484
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,990
This is not good. We cannot just let this go.

485
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:08,630
Father must know that someone tried to kill Princess and Grand Prince.

486
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,060
Orabeoni, please do not tell Father.

487
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,130
Princess, you must tell Crown Prince the truth.

488
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,650
After Grand Prince saw the head shaman dying at the interrogation site,

489
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,890
he saw the oyat tree burning.

490
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,740
He could neither eat nor sleep properly since then.

491
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,840
We saw a physician, but nothing seemed to work.

492
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,070
Since Princess was worried about her brotherâ€“

493
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,600
Since I was so worried,

494
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,290
Court Lady Kwon told me what she heard from other court ladies.

495
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,360
And out of desperation...

496
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,350
Mother, Court Lady Kwon did not do anything wrong.

497
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,990
I decided to do this, not Court Lady Kwon.

498
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,970
I told her not to tell you, Mother.

499
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,100
Princess.

500
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,980
Orabeoni, I could not make you worry since you were about to get married.

501
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,820
So I asked Sergeant, trying to come up with a solution myself.

502
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,980
I had to do something.

503
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,600
Orabeoni.

504
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,100
It has been more than a month since he has been sick.

505
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,070
If anything bad happens to him,

506
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,790
how could I keep on living?

507
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,180
You must have been tormented all this time.

508
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,690
Do not cry, Princess.

509
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,200
I am just grateful to you.

510
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,270
Do not worry about Grand Prince.

511
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:46,190
Who are his older siblings? You and Crown Prince.

512
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:52,430
Both of you are so strong. I am sure he will overcome this soon.

513
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,020
The man who tried to kill Grand Prince. How did he appear?

514
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,450
He said he was a traveling monk. But I do not know what the truth is...

515
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,730
Did you see what he did

516
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,010
to Grand Prince?

517
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,260
Did you happen to see the incense burner in the room?

518
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,010
Incense burner...

519
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,400
I did.

520
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,810
Were there dried petals in the incense burner by chance?

521
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,210
I might have seen them.

522
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,930
What else was there?

523
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,800
It was a small temple. There was nothing unusual...

524
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,650
He was drinking tea!

525
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,860
Do you remember what tea it was?

526
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,860
I do not know. He did not give it to Grand Prince or me.

527
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,590
Your Highness, the fact that Court Lady Kwon

528
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,990
of the Queen's Palace escorted them to the monk be a coincidence?

529
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,180
Not only that, she was wearing a veil.

530
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,030
We can check with a court lady from the Queen's Palace when the day breaks.

531
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:51,870
But if she were on their side, she could easily lie.

532
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,230
Also, women often wear veils.

533
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,820
Court Lady Kwon is being treated for the injury. Leave her for now.

534
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,260
We have to be careful because she is a court lady of the Queen's Palace.

535
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,370
But Court Lady Kwon came to the palace as a bonbang court lady.

536
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:15,050
What does that mean?

537
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,060
It means she was brought here by the Queen from her family home.

538
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,500
She must work for the Right State Minister.

539
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:28,370
However, to say the Right State Minister was behind this,

540
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,800
the Jo family of Seongju has no reason to kill Grand Prince and Princess.

541
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,640
Also, since she works for the Right State Minister,

542
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,870
she cannot be a wife from the Song family.

543
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,880
If so, in the end...

544
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,610
all of this must be the work of the people of Byeokcheon.

545
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,320
If it is true that they are not bandits and

546
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,580
they put up a white flag and waited for the royal forces,

547
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,260
they must have targeted the royal family as revenge for that.

548
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,140
 How come the Queen said... 

549
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,900
 You must tell Crown Prince the truth. 

550
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,190
 After Grand Prince saw the head shaman dying at the interrogation site, 

551
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,240
 he saw the oyat tree burning. 

552
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,320
 He could neither eat nor sleep properly since then. 

553
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,410
 Since Princess was worried about her brotherâ€“ 

554
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,200
 She said she'd tell the truth, 

555
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,100
 but why did she not mention that Grand Prince gave 

556
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,570
 Crown Prince Ui Hyeon the peach? 

557
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,780
It's getting late! Have a safe travel back.

558
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,520
Let me walk you to the gate.

559
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,000
 My Lady, Scholar Park knows who we really are. 

560
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,100
 He gave me fabric and told me to make your clothes. 

561
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,980
Fabric?

562
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,900
 He said we would have to go back when things get resolved. 

563
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,820
 We would be able to clear our names and return to Gaeseong, right? 

564
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,740
 Ga Ram! 

565
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,020
 Also, I ran into a man who used to be a judge of Gaeseong Office in the market. 

566
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,570
 He saw my face. 

567
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,660
 I avoided the potential danger by running away out of fear. 

568
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,090
 But you might run into him when you go to Manyeondang, too. 

569
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,260
 So be careful. 

570
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,960
A judge of Gaeseong Office?

571
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,630
Is he the one who was going to Hanyang because he was promoted as

572
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,000
a commander at the Capital Military Force?

573
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:27,620
If the reason her memory comes and goes is because of the thing called

574
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,000
peonies or opium that was in the kitchen,

575
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,480
I need to remember for her.

576
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:38,840
What I remember in the house in Gaeseong when the murders occurred.

577
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,090
It rained a lot and...

578
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,760
No, no. Nothing like that.

579
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,410
 His Lordship was painting. 

580
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,730
Was it even a painting?

581
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,820
Why did he paint in red?

582
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,550
It did not seem like he was painting orchids.

583
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,110
Why did he draw a few lines?

584
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,170
Does that have anything to do with the case?

585
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,130
 By chance, do you have a twin? 

586
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,500
 I am sure I saw your face! 

587
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,370
 Just four hours ago, did you not point a sword at me? 

588
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,680
 Did you really not come to Mt. Surak? 

589
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,810
Are you saying the body disappeared?

590
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,600
We searched everywhere inside and outside the temple,

591
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,230
but the body was not found.

592
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,610
I did look into the temple.

593
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,000
The temple is originally owned by Biwonseo.

594
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,170
It is a place for traveling monks to stay a night in.

595
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,610
The man who died rented that temple for the first time that night.

596
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,780
The man who took the body

597
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,510
has to be Tae Kang's twin.

598
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,520
It might be.

599
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,180
I asked the court ladies,

600
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,610
and there definitely were rumors about the traveling monk inside the palace.

601
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,960
The one who told Court Lady Kwon about him

602
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,520
mentioned him for no particular reason about two months ago.

603
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,520
You went through a lot last night. I sincerely thank you for protecting

604
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,010
Princess and Grand Prince.

605
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:58,010
I just did my job, Your Highness.

606
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,510
Her Highness the Queen summons you, Sergeant.

607
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,840
 The Crown Prince saw the ghost's letter. 

608
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,400
Crown Prince.

609
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:59,010
Why were you not conceived by me?

610
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,350
It would have been nice

611
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,630
if you were my child, who came from me.

612
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,230
 A woman from the Song family is in the palace. 

613
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,670
 The Yi family will perish 

614
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:41,140
 and a true man of the Song Family will soon appear and start a new dynasty. 

615
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,140
   

616
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,740
If you burn incense with peony leaves and cast hypnosis,

617
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,870
 the hair of the one under a spell turns gray. 

618
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:58,800
That is why Shim Young and Head Shaman had gray hair.

619
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,110
Crown Prince... how much did you find out?

620
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,050
You are a smart man. Soon you will...

621
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,080
find out about me.

622
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,890
 He was drinking tea! 

623
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:20,150
 He did not give it to Grand Prince or me. 

624
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:24,790
 That tea must have worked as an antidote, so the one who cast hypnosis 

625
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,820
 will not get intoxicated from the peony scent. 

626
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,950
 Jae Yi's memory faltered from just smelling it because she did not have the tea. 

627
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,260
Stop.

628
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,240
Hyung.

629
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,220
Pretend you do not know.

630
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,360
We could go back home soon.

631
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,580
Let us talk then...

632
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,570
Are you here to look for a book again...

633
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,670
Catch him! Catch him!

634
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,140
- Let go! I need to catch him! 
 - No...

635
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,570
Let go, I said! What is wrong with you?

636
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,560
Let go of me right now!

637
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:53,370
 Do not forget the ghost's letter that describes your destiny. 

638
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,430
 Dong Ja Bae Do Woo Ja Hyang Gum. 

639
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,900
 Which means your friend will point a sword at your back. 

640
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,300
 Your Highness, Sergeant is here. 

641
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:18,250
 Eunuch Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace is Min Jae Yi, 

642
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,390
 the daughter of Gaeseong's governor. 

643
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,980
Let him in.

644
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,530
Welcome, Sergeant.

645
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,860
You saw your twin! You knew, too.

646
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,950
You are from Byeokcheon, are you not?

647
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,910
Stop! Please stop!

648
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:53,850
You must be one of them. I need to tell His Highness.

649
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,170
He needs to know, too!

650
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,300
Shut up.

651
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,540
It is not true. It is not true!

652
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,450
   

653
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:38,220


654
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,300
   

655
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,150
 Our card that will destroy the Crown Prince you mentioned before... 

656
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,420
 She is your betrothed. 

657
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,290
 She must be by the Crown Prince's side. 

658
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,610
   

659
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,050
 You must have had something to tell me secretly. 

660
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,760
 What kind of things happened without my knowledge? 

661
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,290
 The key evidence that can correct everything might be there. 

662
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:10,990
 It is something we cannot ignore to get to the truth.
