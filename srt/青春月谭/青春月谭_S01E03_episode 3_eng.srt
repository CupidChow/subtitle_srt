1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,520
   

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,620
   

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,320
   

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,540
   

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,470
   

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,120
   

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,000
   

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,980
   

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,220
Look over here!

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,890
Here is a woman who committed a treacherous crime!

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,280
Please take her away!

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,110
But please listen to what I have to say.

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,480
The Crown Prince of Joseon received a cursed letter from a ghost.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,150
The rumor in the streets is true!

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,910


16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,310
Your Highness, I'll accept whatever status you give me.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,040
I will never become a detriment to you.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,120
So please... Please...

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,740
Please help me.

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,690
   

21
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,850
Did you say that you would become one of my first people?

22
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,470
That is so, Your Highness.

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,110
You were not so bad as the one who would become my first people.

24
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,320
Did you say that you risked your life to come here to me from Gaeseong?

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,900
That is correct, Your Highness.

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,130
Then it would be even easier for you to come to the Eastern Palace. 
  (T/N: Palace of the Crown Prince) 

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,300
Did you say that Joseon does not tell a girl,

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,170
"Yes, you can. Do it. Try it"?

29
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,340
As the one who will become my first people, I will give all of those permissions.

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,160
Come to the Eastern Palace.

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,540
However, you must find your own way inside.

32
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,580
Yes, you can.

33
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,650
Do it.

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,810
Try it.

35
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,890
What is the matter, Your Highness?

36
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,720
You said to wait from afar, so I did as you had ordered, but I heard a loud noise.

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,550
Let's go.

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,560
Are we just going?

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,580
What about that bastard?

40
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,450
   

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,900
Your Highness. Crown Prince, Your Highness!

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,610
Your Highness, I shall do as you have commanded me.

43
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,040
Would it be all right to just let that bastard be?

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,870
Let us see what he decides to do.

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,170
Excuse me, what do I need to do to change into a eunuch's uniform?

46
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,390
- Are you a eunuch? 
 - Yes.

47
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,330
I'm the new eunuch for the Eastern Palace.

48
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,290
I followed His Highness to the military training hunt, and I did not get to change my clothes yet.

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,940
His Highness ordered that I get changed into my uniform.

50
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,210
Eunuch Byung.

51
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,930
He's a eunuch at the Eastern Palace.

52
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,510
His Highness ordered him to get changed into a new uniform.

53
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,790
Follow me.

54
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,550
Yes.

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,510
Come inside.

56
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,530
Here. Take these.

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,980
- You may go inside there and get changed. 
 - Yes.

58
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,200
Thank you.

59
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,640
Who is that?

60
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,910
He's a new eunuch at the Eastern Palace.

61
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,100
He's so unlucky.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,860
How would such a delicate guy last long in the Eastern Palace?

63
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,800
Gosh, he won't even last three days.

64
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,470
    
 Come and take a seat here.

65
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,820
I mean, how could you say that you love her?

66
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,730
Even if she were to be innocent like you said, Teacher,

67
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,640
that woman has a fiance–

68
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,580
According to rumors, she also had another man on the side.

69
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,270
But what does it matter? Since I like her.

70
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,200
Have you ever seen this book?

71
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,600
   
 (T/N: A book of law and medicine commissioned under King Se Jong, used for CSI) 

72
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,880
What is this book?

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,690
It is Shin Ju Mu Won Rok. Are you not able to read?

74
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,280
How are you thinking of becoming my student when you cannot even read?

75
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,720
What does being able to read have anything to do with the autopsy?

76
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,770
- Autopsy is usually done by ojakin– 
 - Oh, so what you are saying is...
  (T/N: ojakin is a low-class servant responsible for touching dead bodies) 

77
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,340
since autopsy is done by lowly ojakin,

78
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,340
it is fine if you are unable to read books.

79
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,030
Is that what you are saying?

80
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,120
Hey! Look at this guy.

81
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
Even though an autopsy is considered a lowly work because it deals with dead bodies,

82
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,340
but it is also the work of finding out the cause of death,

83
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,590
so it is an important job that values life!

84
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,290
When I was under a different teacher, I learned Female Letters–

85
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,100
What do you mean by Female Letters! That's a derogatory term for the written language.

86
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,260
Did not that teacher teach you what a beautiful alphabet our written language is?

87
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,830
Yes, I learned all of that. I did, but...

88
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
there are bugs living in my head.

89
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,400
Whenever I learn something, these bugs eat it all up.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,260
Also, where would a lowly person like me ever use something like that?

91
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,670
Where would you use it? You would use it...

92
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,500
to make a living.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,110
I can understand if you do not know Chinese characters because it is difficult,

94
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,000
but you should at least know the written language!

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,480
- I am already busy working to get by– 
 - What a lazy bastard!

96
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,010
The written language was made by the great King Se Jong for guys like you.

97
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,550
No matter how stupid someone is, they can learn it in just one day.

98
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,400
Do you think there is any other alphabet out there as good as this?

99
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,300
Since you say that you did learn from your previous teacher,

100
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,090
I will first assess your skills,so try writing my name.

101
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,640
so try writing my name.

102
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,980
My name is Kim Myung Jin.

103
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,050
   

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,770
You wrote it pretty well! You're not so bad!

105
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,260
Since you have the fundamentals, it won't even take half a day!

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,360
Wow, gosh.

107
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,910
In any case, then,

108
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,510
how about you tell me about yourself?

109
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,510
About what?

110
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,690
If I were to use you as my student, I should know what kind of person you are.

111
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,500
I mean, as we were coming here in the morning,

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,180
you introduced me as your student to everyone in the neighborhood!

113
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,460
If I don't like you,

114
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
then I will send you packing.

115
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,200
Seriously...

116
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,270
Your writing skills are not too shabby.

117
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,150
Tell me what you know how to do and what you do not.

118
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,400
Your Highness, there is something we prepared last night.

119
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,620
You came back so late from the military training hunt that we could not show it to you.

120
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,250
We should show it to you now.

121
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,470
Your Highness, please pretend it is last night right now.

122
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,050
If he shoots it, it is one shot, one kill.

123
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,970
- His Highness is amazing! 
 - His Highness!

124
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,230
He's the best! What a genius he is!

125
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,470
The best in Joseon! Your Highness!

126
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,660
Hooray!

127
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,770
Please stop.

128
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,790
But how did you keep that under your robes?

129
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,090
For Your Highness, this is nothing.

130
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,760
Thank you.

131
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,280
Your Highness, if we were to bring in a new servant to the Eastern Palace at a time like this,

132
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,530
how good would it be to have their fresh new energy?

133
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,670
That is right, Your Highness.

134
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,250
If you were to give us the command, we would immediately go and

135
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,490
- bring someone who's friendly and energetic– 
 - No, that should not be so.

136
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,990
I have you guys who take such good care of me,

137
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,730
so what is the use of having someone who is friendly and energetic?

138
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,960
I refuse.

139
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,580
Open the doors!

140
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,300
We failed again.

141
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,590
What can you do? He really does not like bringing in new people.

142
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,290
Then he should not fire people.

143
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,860
He fires people on a whim.

144
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,450
Just offer up your prayers.

145
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,370
You never know. Something unusual might happen today, and His Highness

146
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,900
may accept someone new out of a generous heart.

147
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,970
- Shall we go to the wishing shrine? 
 - Let us first go draw some water.

148
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,250
   

149
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,580
As a eunuch of the Eastern Palace, I cannot ask where the Eastern Palace is...

150
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,820
You are going to have problems like that.

151
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,210
I am afraid that you may spill the sami tea that I specially prepared for Orabeoni.

152
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,770
Give it to me. I will carry it.

153
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,110
I am sorry.

154
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,670
Everyone will be at ease

155
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,710
if you slow down while walking

156
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,480
and mind your manners as a royal, Princess.

157
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,440
The Princess is going to meet her Orabeoni?

158
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,150
Are you all right?

159
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,610
How dare you! Get away from her this instant!

160
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,120
How could you dare touch the Princess!

161
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,220
You are a new face.

162
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,910
I will be working at the Eastern Palace starting today.

163
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,590
But it is my first time at the Eastern Palace

164
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,720
so I was lost in the palace, to my shame.

165
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,160
Yeah. The palace is quite huge.

166
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,530
Follow me. I was heading to my orabeoni anyway.

167
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,830
It is an honor.

168
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,110
The news of His Highness being quite picky is widespread amongst the eunuchs, right?

169
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,220
You will know as you get to know him.

170
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,240
My orabeoni is not like that.

171
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,100
Could you promise me that you will assist the Crown Prince, His Highness, with much care?

172
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,190
How could I do otherwise, Your Highness?

173
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,310
   

174
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,540
Does it not matter, regardless of how insignificant it is?

175
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,740
Yes. Tell me.

176
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,800
First, I am good at jumping fences.

177
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,800
I mean, are you talking about this kind of jumping fence?

178
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,350
I am just so good at jumping fences.

179
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,990
Nice!

180
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,800
 What were you thinking that you wore a man's clothing? 

181
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,010
 Father... 

182
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,130
 Your Lordship... 

183
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,400
 Honestly, 

184
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,120
 There was a sickly man in the lower village who received fifty beatings and was put in jail. 

185
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,310
 But from what I can tell, he is not the culprit. 

186
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,210
 This is not just a matter of resolving the situation of a man who was unjustly confined. 

187
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,350
 You cannot go around like this. 

188
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,100
 How could a girl dress in a man's clothes? 

189
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,720
 I need to be a man... I need to be a man to save him. 

190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,340
 I need to present myself like this for my voice to be heard. 

191
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,120
 Does the world even listen to a girl wearing a dress? 

192
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,690
 His young daughter is starving at home, waiting for her father to return. 

193
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,300
 I must prove his innocence so that I can return her father to the daughter. 

194
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
 For you to wear a man's clothes 

195
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,150
 is to oppose the order of this world. 

196
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,340
 It is to fight against the world. 

197
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,940
 If you leave the women's quarters and try to start something, 

198
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,490
 the walls of the world will stop you. 

199
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,340
 Also, there will continuously be high thresholds 

200
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,830
 will be placed in your path. 

201
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,760
 Will you be able to endure it? 

202
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,780
 Will you be able to continue pushing forward without giving up? 

203
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,120
 I like the world too much for me to keep myself 

204
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,630
 bound in the women's quarters out of fear of all that, Father. 

205
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,070
 If there is a threshold, I will step over it. 

206
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,410
 The world is fun, and I'm curious about it. 

207
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,650
 I want to run as best as I can 

208
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,790
 and I want to see 

209
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,260
 every nook and cranny of the world. 

210
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,440
 Yes, you can. Do it. 

211
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,340
 Try it. 

212
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,250
 As the one who will become my first people, 

213
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,510
 I give you all of those permissions. 

214
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,210
Come over here.

215
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,630
All right. This is the Eastern Palace.

216
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,630
Do not get lost from now on, and find your way here well.

217
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,920
Yes.

218
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,720
I will no longer get lost.

219
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,400
 If someone had placed a fake secret letter in the wedding gifts that I had sent, 

220
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,520
 that person must be the one who sent me the ghost's letter 

221
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,000
 or one of his men. 

222
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,210
 The one who fired an arrow at me to make the curse a reality, 

223
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,990
 the one who killed the herald I sent to Gaeseong, 

224
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,240
 and the one who killed the family of my master... 

225
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,930
 Are they all the same people? 

226
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,260
 It is probably one of them. 

227
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,570
 Who among them is it? 

228
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,590
 I swear to you that my arrow will never fly toward you at any given moment, Your Highness. 

229
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,990
 That was not mine. 

230
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,330
 I did not shoot an arrow at Your Highness! 

231
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,570
 It was not me. I did not do it! 

232
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,230
 Whose hand should I take up 

233
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,920
 and whose hand should I drop? 

234
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,580
- Tell him. 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

235
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,780
Your Highness, the Princess is here.

236
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,150
Come in.

237
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,810
On the way, I met a new eunuch.

238
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,260
He was wandering lost because he could not find the Eastern Palace.

239
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,630
Your Highness, as you had commanded me, I have found my own way here.

240
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,580
Sergeant Han went to visit Oh Man Shik

241
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,910
of the department of Taoism because the celebratory message got drenched with blood.

242
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,090
I also looked into it.

243
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,910
If someone played a prank during the Crown Prince's military training hunt,

244
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,750
would it not be right to catch that guy and twist his legs?

245
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,870
But Gap Soo, when I went to the department of Taoism,

246
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,970
that guy supposedly did not even come to work today.

247
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,020
I wonder if he will be home...

248
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,830
It appears he has already fled.

249
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,530
- Search everywhere. 
 - Yes, Sir.

250
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,770
There is not even a trace of him.

251
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,320
It appears he has also taken his family with him as well.

252
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,370
What is going on? Did something happen at this house?

253
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,840
Do you know the man named Oh Man Shik?

254
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,520
Of course, I do. I live next door.

255
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,400
When was the last time you saw him?

256
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
Did you not hear anything about where he might be going?

257
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,340
A month ago, he was getting rid of his things.

258
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,040
So I wondered what was going on.

259
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,250
But he was selling everything that was worth anything.

260
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,860
I feel bad for the Sergeant Han.

261
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,720
He's been knocked down by a girl

262
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,370
and he will not be able to catch Oh Man Shik, either.

263
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,970
So futile, like he was a dog chasing a chicken.

264
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,000
Orabeoni.

265
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,050
What has changed that you decided to use a new eunuch at the Eastern Palace?

266
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,100
You should come here as well.

267
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,570
Did I not tell you that my orabeoni is not such a scary person?

268
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,040
Come here and serve us tea.

269
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,960
Do you know that eunuch?

270
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,410
No, I do not know him.

271
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,530
Me neither.

272
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,620
- Did I see him before? 
 - I mean, did he not clearly say

273
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,200
that he does not want a different eunuch?

274
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,720
I know. What is going on?

275
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,210
Was not there someone he had selected in advance to bring to the Eastern Palace?

276
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,450
It was Eunuch Kim's relative.

277
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,100
"I will call you into the Eastern Palace."

278
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,230
I boldly told him that I would.

279
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,930
I did not think our Highness would be like that,

280
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,140
but choosing the right people is really important...

281
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,000
I do not think it is good for him to handpick someone like that and bring him in.

282
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,770
 Your Highness, Grand Prince Myung Ahn is here. 

283
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,760
Have him come in.

284
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,740
He is making excuses daily because he does not want to attend the royal academy.

285
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,790
Please teach him a lesson, Orabeoni.

286
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,570
You promised to come here together,

287
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,340
but you came here by yourself.

288
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,440
You can put it down.

289
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,770
I heard that your archery skills were amazing at the military training hunt.

290
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,190
And so you should take after Orabeoni and improve your archery skills.

291
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,160
The Grand Prince cannot even ride a horse yet.

292
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,660
Do you know how scary it is?

293
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,720
It makes me want to pee...

294
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,520
Were you not afraid of horses, Hyungnim?

295
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,160
Maybe it is because I learned how to ride horses from Hyungnim,

296
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,330
but I was not scared at all.

297
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,560
And so, it will not be scary either if you learn from me.

298
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,240
Then, would you please personally teach me sometime?

299
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,500
In return, you must not skip royal academy, all right?

300
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,550
Yes. I promise.

301
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,480
So, Orabeoni,

302
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,710
how did you manage to solve the mystery of the celebratory message?

303
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,700
The one who solved the mystery of the celebratory message was not me,

304
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,840
but it was him.

305
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,150
Really?

306
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,580
He is the new eunuch that Orabeoni brought in.

307
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,820
I was able to tell that he was intelligent at a glance.

308
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,620
I like you.

309
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,280
I am honored.

310
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,700
Then do you want to take him to your palace?

311
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,180
Really? Can I do that?

312
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,220
Would you follow me to the Princess Palace?

313
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,760
- Your Highness. 
 - Or how about you, Grand Prince Myung 
 Ahn?

314
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,270
Since you are quite generous to your subordinates,

315
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,440
- it may be even better for him to go to Myung Ahn– 
 - No, I cannot!

316
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,060
No, Your Highness!

317
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,570
I am already an eunuch of the Eastern Palace,

318
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,400
how could a bird sit on two branches?

319
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,190
I am sorry, Your Highness, but please allow me to serve the Crown Prince, His Highness.

320
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,780
How could someone with such a handsome face also speak so well?

321
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,830
What is your name?

322
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,380
I will also remember it well.

323
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,760
My name is...

324
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,890
 He is truly colder than ice in the ice storage. 

325
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,050
Yes, my name is...

326
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,930
   

327
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,550
   

328
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,520
Soon Dol, you wretch!

329
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,460
You are so pathetic.

330
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,750
After having lost your way to the palace, have you now also forgotten your name?

331
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,150
Your name is Go Soon Dol, you stupid idiot.

332
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,980
Soon Dol!

333
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,380
Right, Go Soon Dol.

334
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,200
My name is Go Soon Dol.

335
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,180
I must have forgotten my name temporarily because I am pathetic and stupid.

336
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,440
Soon Dol.

337
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,360
It is a name that suits you.

338
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,460
I shall make sure to remember it.

339
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,930
Since such a pretty eunuch has entered the Eastern Palace,

340
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,580
I can finally be a bit more at ease.

341
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,730
Orabeoni.

342
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,790
You heard about the fiancee of Sergeant Han, right?

343
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,530
Is there anyone in all our land who does not know her?

344
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,940
Is she not so evil?

345
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,130
Supposedly, she had another man.

346
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,610
Supposedly, she got caught by the Governor, His Lordship, while trying to run away with that guy

347
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,250
before her marriage to the Sergeant,

348
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,310
and so she just killed her entire family.

349
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,710
I heard that she bought arsenic and put it into the soup pot from which her family was eating,

350
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,490
and she alone did not eat that soup.

351
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,110
Gosh, so scary.

352
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,990
From what I heard, she fell from a cliff and died.

353
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,330
Since we were not able to find the body,

354
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,790
who knows if she is alive or not?

355
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,180
Do not say that!

356
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,740
Her body had probably already floated out to sea.

357
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,420
Goodness...

358
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,020
I feel so bad for Sergeant Han.

359
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,870
His handsome face has become so gaunt...

360
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,150
These are all the things that man Oh sold me.

361
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,980
From just looking at it,

362
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,190
it is clear it is a valuable item that came over from Ming country.

363
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,640
I wonder how such a valuable item was in that household.

364
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,610
Is this item really something that man sold you?

365
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,990
Oh, of course!

366
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,510
For that, he took at least a small house's worth in return.

367
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,600
His family members were already gone ten days ago,

368
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,440
and it appears that Oh Man Shik left last night.

369
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,830
Did you find anything interesting?

370
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,500
It does not appear so.

371
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,880
 For sure, this item belongs to my Father. 

372
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,370
 How could such a strange thing happen unless it is a trick played by a ghost? 

373
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,940
 Do not speak such profane words. A trick played by a ghost? 

374
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,590
 No. It cannot be... 

375
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,890
 How could this item 

376
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,190
 be among things that man sold? 

377
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,030
The answer you found was just

378
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,860
coming here dressed and pretending to be a eunuch without a name?

379
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,430
This is the position I can be by your side

380
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,640
most naturally without being suspicious.

381
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,120
So you're saying you would stay by my side looking like that?

382
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,790
I'm not looking for a place to rest my body.

383
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,670
And I'm certainly not looking for a place to live comfortably.

384
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,460
I just...

385
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,560
want to feel shameless under the sun, avenge my family,

386
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,140
and return to my betrothed.

387
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,000
The last thing my father told me was to protect Your Highness.

388
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,870
If you entrust me, I'll solve the mystery of the ghost's letter.

389
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,950
Are you suggesting we make a deal?

390
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,980
Are you not curious, at least?

391
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,270
Who hid the secret letter you did not even write among my wedding presents?

392
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,440
Who sent a secret letter like that to my father for what reason?

393
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,270
I need to know.

394
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,230
What is the ghost's letter anyway that

395
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,120
my family had to die so tragically?

396
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,700
How did I end up being on the run by being framed by such a horrible rumor?

397
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,830
I'll make sure to find out.

398
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,240
The cases your brother, Min Yoon Jae, solved...

399
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,950
Is it true that you solved all of them?

400
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,010
I did it with my servant.

401
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,490
Yap!

402
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,330
That is a rubbish martial art.

403
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,940
Is that all you can do?

404
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,930
Do you know how many culprits I caught with this broom?

405
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,150
Gosh! I really hate brooms.

406
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,800
Do you know how much my mother beat me with that-

407
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,880
Forget about the broom. Is there anything you know how to do?

408
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,120
Running.

409
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,480
Running?

410
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,970
Well...

411
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,600
Can you even run... with those short legs?

412
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,420
How fast could you possibly run?

413
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,930
Do not underestimate me. No matter what you're thinking,

414
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,590
I'm better than that.

415
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,140
 Get him! 

416
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,050
 Hey! 

417
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,620
Young Master, I'll be ahead of you!

418
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,880
- What? 
 - Who are you?

419
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,180
What? I'm the servant of Young Master Min Yoon Jae of Gaeseong Governor!

420
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,840
Just submit yourself.

421
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,840
Ga Ram!

422
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,290
 The one who caught Gaeseong's thief Kim Joon Hyun, who hasn't been caught for 10 years 

423
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,210
was not my brother but us.

424
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,440
Also, Moon Seo Jin, the serial killer.

425
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,620
- You're ruining my appetite. 
 - Geez...

426
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,690
Did you see it? Did you see me killing those bastards 10 years ago?

427
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,970
I am here to investigate because I did not see it myself.

428
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,810
I am here just to ask questions. Why are you so upset?

429
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,100
As if... you're guilty of the murders.

430
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,160
You cannot wait to eat your funeral food, are you not?

431
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,610
Am I only good at running? I'm pretty clever, too.

432
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,890
I'm really good at utilizing objects around me.

433
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,970
I'm not afraid even without a knife or an arrow!

434
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,080
Geez, hot!

435
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,380
Aigoo! It slipped out of my hands! Aigoo! I'm so sorry!

436
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,690
Are you crazy?

437
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,110
- Are you okay? 
 - It got him real good.

438
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,320
C-Come this way! Aigoo, what should we do?

439
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,210
Have a seat here! Over here.

440
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,150
Oh my, my, my!

441
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,260
Why did he have to fall like that?

442
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,490
Are you okay? Gosh, that must hurt.

443
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,130
Hey!

444
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,370
You bastard!

445
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,290
Shit!

446
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,180
These washing sticks are my favorite.

447
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,360
They're light, and sturdy, and I love that there are two of them.

448
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,950
I can attack to my left!

449
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,090
And to my right!

450
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,690
Two of them at the same time! This one, that one! This one, that one! This one, that one!

451
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,300
This one, that one! This one, that one! This one, that one! This one, that one!

452
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,640
Attack on all sides!

453
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,280
There!

454
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,600
You're really something.

455
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,250
I beat so many of them this these!

456
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,710
Who, exactly?

457
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,330
What do you think, Teacher?

458
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,910
Did I pass or fail?

459
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,020
P-P-Pass! It's a pass!

460
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,900
- Teacher! 
 - Go away!

461
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,390
I passed all the rounds, then!

462
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,590
You came to the Eastern Palace as you promised.

463
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,530
So I'll give you a chance.

464
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,290
You must prove what you're capable of.

465
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,050
Solve those cases you mentioned.

466
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,840
 They were looking for eyewitnesses to murders that had occurred inside the capital. 

467
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,920
 I will resolve these cases and prove myself. 

468
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,850
I will hear about your family's deaths after I test your ability.

469
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:15,180
After that, I will think about how to use you.

470
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,390
I can solve them in ten days!

471
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,870
It summarizes those two cases.

472
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,670
Go ahead and read it.

473
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,850
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,460
Eunuch So, are you there? Summon Tae Kang.

475
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,590
Father.

476
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,470
I'll step in for a moment.

477
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,500
 Come in. 

478
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,020
- You're late. 
 - Yes, Father.

479
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,740
I'm late because I was investigating

480
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,700
the department of Taoism regarding the celebratory message at the military training hunting grounds.

481
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
Did you find out anything?

482
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,350
I went to the house of the person who was in charge of the water and brush,

483
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,800
but he already ran away with his family.

484
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,430
It appears that he had been planning it for a long time.

485
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,280
I see...

486
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,040
I guess you will be coming home late for a while.

487
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,670
Considering the scale of the incident, he must have been hired by someone.

488
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,350
I do not think this was done by some lowly public official from the office of Taoism rites.

489
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,480
If they did something like that to Joseon's Crown Prince,

490
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,220
they must have had a goal.

491
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,220
It feels ominous and evil.

492
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:20,660
It is as if the Crown Prince of Joseon was cursed by a ghost, as the rumor says.

493
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:27,470
No matter who was behind this, their goal must be to train the Crown Prince.

494
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,760
They're scaring the Crown Prince

495
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,280
so they can control him.

496
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,970
What do you mean, they're training His Highness?

497
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,750
The Crown Prince is bound to be the next King,

498
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,790
and the King should not be too strong.

499
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,630
I'm not really sure what you mean-

500
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:53,290
How do you think His Highness ended up where he is right now?

501
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,460
- That's... 
 - It's because his father is the King,

502
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,100
and his father's father was the King.

503
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,810
Look at the King right now. He might be the son of the palace water maid,

504
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,920
but his father was the King.

505
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,650
That is how he ended up on the throne.

506
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,640
The King's position does not require validation.

507
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,150
You just need to have the King's blood. However...

508
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,580
having the blood does not mean... he is qualified.

509
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,500
- Father. 
 - The King's qualification

510
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,820
is given by his court.

511
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,700
At a contest where they strengthen the king's virtue of Confucius and Mencius,

512
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,730
why do you think the ministers are present?

513
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,790
A great king

514
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:39,670
is made by the ministers, who were chosen among top intellectuals.

515
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,000
The Crown Prince

516
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,940
has the qualities of becoming the most dangerous king.

517
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,960
He's clever but arrogant.

518
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,270
And he does not trust or depend on his court.

519
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,440
How could you say something so disloyal?

520
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,650
The Crown Prince...

521
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,910
is not the King yet.

522
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,370
I hope he learns after this.

523
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,490
That without his court that stands by him,

524
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,550
he might not be able to get on the throne.

525
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,980
He is not the only one... who has the King's blood.

526
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,180
You mean Grand Prince Myung Ahn could be the King?

527
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:25,210
I do not know who was behind this, but that must be their goal.

528
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,970
I will protect His Highness myself.

529
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,240
I am not sure if that would be possible.

530
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,830
The relationship between a king and his loyal subject is not something you decide on your own.

531
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,220
His Highness...

532
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,220
does not trust even you, his dear friend.

533
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,830
Do you not understand that?

534
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,490
Where are we going?

535
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,850
Can he not talk because his mouth is glued shut?

536
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,870
Where are we, exactly?

537
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,040
Hold this.

538
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,170
 Come downstairs. 

539
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,490
His Highness has used this space since last year.

540
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,550
This is the place you will be staying in for a while.

541
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,880
I will be staying here?

542
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,970
Why...

543
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,880
Why are you doing this to me?

544
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,720
I do not trust you.

545
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,590
I'll be keeping my eyes on you!

546
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,520
If you appear to be a threat to His Highness,

547
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,400
I'll cut your throat without hesitation!

548
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,040
His Highness wants to keep me by his side because he needs me.

549
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,740
How could his servant treat me like this?

550
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,090
I'm saying you'd better not try anything funny.

551
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,090
I will not try anything funny.

552
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,300
So do not ever point fingers at me again.

553
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,650
Although I'm offended, I'll consider it as a welcoming gesture. But...

554
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,030
I will not forget the fact that you grabbed me

555
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,570
by my collar twice already.

556
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,180
I engrained this in my brain, too.

557
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,770
That you hit me there...

558
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,400
Geez!

559
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,730
Why do you want that man by your side?

560
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,340
It's food.

561
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,480
Food... I'm so...

562
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,240
grateful for this food.

563
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,960
 Should I confirm if he's really Jang Chi Soo 

564
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,850
at Choongmuhoe?

565
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,140
Just leave it.

566
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,500
I already confirmed it.

567
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,380
You gave him the eunuch status

568
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,190
and you gave him your secret room, too. Why is that?

569
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,750
I thought...

570
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,950
he might become someone I need, just like I need you.

571
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,660
Before you became my royal bodyguard,you were just a thug in the market.

572
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,540
That's...

573
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,000
true, but...

574
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,000
 I held onto my father's faith in you 

575
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,860
 and in hopes of becoming your very first people bowing under your feet, 

576
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,540
 I thought I would get to find out 

577
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,800
 the reason my family died if I could meet you. 

578
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,800
 So, I came all the way here, risking my life! 

579
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,340
 It did not seem like she was lying. 

580
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,450
Crown Prince, that bastard.

581
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,590
I can't seem to figure him out.

582
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,460
 Take this with you to leave the palace. 

583
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,590
 I cannot allow a traitor who committed a grave sin by my side. 

584
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,110
I'm sure he never intended to have me leave the palace.

585
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,120
He was planning to test what I would do.

586
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,420
And I passed that test.

587
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,750
 She survived by herself even though 

588
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,700
 her whole family got killed. 

589
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,710
 It is also true that she purchased the arsenic. 

590
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,180
 She is gifted in martial arts. 

591
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:36,570
 I cannot rule out Min Jae Yi from killing the herald. 

592
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,450
 The Crown Prince 

593
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,510
 has the qualities of becoming the most dangerous king. 

594
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,790
 His Highness does not... 

595
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,050
 trust even you, his dear friend. Do you not understand that? 

596
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:50,550
The Crown Prince does not trust anyone.

597
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,260
He is very suspicious.

598
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,910
Even so, he is generous enough to care for me,

599
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:58,700
who starved for several days.

600
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,860
Did he see the food table in the room?

601
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,520
Yes.

602
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,510
Did he not say anything?

603
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,950
He did not...

604
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,180
Crown Prince.

605
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,790
I insulted you in my head

606
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,840
by calling you even colder than the ice

607
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,120
in the ice storage.

608
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,720
I'll take that back.

609
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,060
But I know that you still can't trust me.

610
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,670
I'll...

611
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,990
make sure to solve these two cases and prove myself to you.

612
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,150
Just wait and see.

613
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,430
 His Highness has used this space since last year. 

614
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:33,670
♫  Your voice is steeped in pain  ♫

615
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:45,480
♫  The words you swallowed tell me everything  ♫

616
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,180
He must've suffered so much.

617
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:59,700
♫  The world has coldly turned its back on me  ♫

618
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:06,150
♫  May I cry with you?  ♫

619
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:18,100
♫  Only when I swallowed sadness  ♫

620
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:24,250
♫  Please remember  ♫

621
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:39,000
♫  That I am also shedding tears just like you right now  ♫

622
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:51,600
♫  I just want to be by your side  ♫

623
00:50:51,600 --> 00:51:04,010
♫  I want to be without any regrets  ♫

624
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,690
 Until he recovered his arm, 

625
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:14,820
 he did not appear weak in front of anyone. 

626
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,500
 He did this thousands, 

627
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,620
 and ten thousand times. 

628
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,960
 He's truly... 

629
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,580
 a strong person. 

630
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:08,310
   

631
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,910
What should I do? What should I do?

632
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,220
What should I do?

633
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,890
What should I do? What should I do!?

634
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,130
My goodness!

635
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,100
   

636
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,900
How did I go to the Eastern Palace yesterday?

637
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,960
Yes, the Eastern Palace... 
  (T/N: Palace of the Crown Prince) 

638
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,970
is where the sun rises.

639
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,070
Geez.

640
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:07,010
On the first day at the Eastern Palace, you must dress properly and greet His Highness formally!

641
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,010
I already informed you last night!

642
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,430
My apologies.

643
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,580
By the way, could someone loan me socks?

644
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,720
You are definitely getting kicked out today.

645
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,930
I bet my ox, my entire asset on it.

646
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,200
 What are you doing? Hurry inside. 

647
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,620
Yes, Your Highness.

648
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:48,090
Your Highness, this is Soon Dol.

649
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,830
Why isn't he kicking him out?

650
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:55,410
I bet my ox.

651
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,020
Go Soon Dol.

652
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,170
Yes, Your Highness.

653
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,950
Why are you not serving your Crown Prince?

654
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,370
Well, yes.

655
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,730
What's going on?

656
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,860
Did the people we sent to Gaeseong return?

657
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,880
This is Maiden Min Jae Yi's shoe.

658
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,280
It was found while they were chasing her.

659
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,810
Looks like it came off while she was running.

660
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,830
What kind of man is this Go Soon Dol person?

661
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,630
Is he someone I can borrow his name from?

662
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,760
He's 22 years old, and he's from Onyang.

663
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,710
His father was eaten by a tiger in the mountain the year he turned three.

664
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,530
His mother died from the plague when he was four. And he has no siblings.

665
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:28,300
He's a eunuch who went missing when there was a big flood last year.

666
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,150
He's as pitiful as I am.

667
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:41,860
By the way, did you remember the names off the top of your head again?

668
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,230
Father told me that you're an amazing person.

669
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,690
He said you remember everything you saw once.

670
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,110
How was...

671
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,800
last night?

672
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,720
Did you sleep comfortably?

673
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,060
You must have been without lodging for more than 15 days while being chased by the royal forces.

674
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:15,550
Thank you for giving me a place to stay, Your Highness.

675
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,130
Did you not get lost in the palace?

676
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:21,400
I ran toward where the sun was rising.

677
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,540
I thought it was so cool while running here.

678
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,760
I mean, the Eastern Palace.

679
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,770
It's located where the sun rises. That means it's the palace that sees the sun first.

680
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,890
You live where the sun rises.

681
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:39,200
Is that not so cool?

682
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,670
Yes.

683
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:45,560
I'm the owner of the Eastern Palace, where the sun rises.

684
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,500
You never seem to miss the opportunity to be proud

685
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,110
when it is appropriate.

686
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:17,990
Get going if you're done talking.

687
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,810
Do you have anything more to say?

688
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,350
Come in!

689
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,710
Report to him in detail.

690
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:37,660
No one saw Lady Min after she fell off the cliff, and just as Gaeseong Office concluded,

691
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,700
she appears to be dead, but we found the signs of someone living inside a cave in Mount Songak.

692
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,180
Did you find Maiden Jae Yi's traces?

693
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,690
Are you saying she's alive?

694
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,630
Why are you staring like that?

695
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:16,640
Looking at you closely like this, you still look like when you were a child.

696
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,620
You're right. We met... when we were children.

697
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,290
Did you remember, too?

698
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,930
Yes.

699
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:37,980


700
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:54,300
♫  When the quiet sound of wind approaches one step closer  ♫

701
01:01:54,300 --> 01:02:08,900
♫  A stranger who brushed against my clothes 
 waving in the air is coming to me  ♫

702
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:18,600
♫  A warm ray of light already came in between my doors  ♫

703
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,070
   

704
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,950
 He's the Eastern Palace's new eunuch. 

705
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,190
 His Highness, who's so picky with people, brought someone new into the Eastern Palace? 

706
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,160
 - Eunuch Go! 
 - Are you okay? 

707
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,080
 This is the herald who was sent to his master, the governor of Gaeseong. 

708
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,180
 They put something interesting on the tip of the arrow. 

709
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,720
 The culprit apparently carved a letter on the back. 

710
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,950
 Do you think it's the same people who killed my family? 

711
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,570
 This was definitely serial murder. 

712
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:43,350
 What could they possibly want? 

713
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,950
 You're going to have to catch the culprit first. 

714
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:50,130
 I think I could find out where the next murder will take place! 

715
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,250
♫  Without me even realizing...  ♫
