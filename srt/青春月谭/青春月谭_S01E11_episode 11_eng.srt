1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,560
   

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,360
   

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,090
   

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,420
   

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,940
   

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,300
   

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,630
   

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,890
   

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,010


10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,210
It's a mess! These things fell from the sky... 
    

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,590
    
 The year I turned two years old,

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,920
my father left that place to start his business, and my family followed him.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,730
Thus, even though Byeokcheon is my hometown, I know nothing about that place.

14
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,610
 The Crown Prince is calling in people from Byeokcheon to the Eastern Palace. 

15
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,370
Still, if it is your father's hometown, you would have heard something about Byeokcheon.

16
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,730
I vaguely remember him saying that it was cold. Being located in northern Joseon,

17
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,420
its land was barren and located in the border town, so it was really hard to live there.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,300
Did something like this happen before?

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,330
   

20
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,230
Step aside! The Minister of Justice is passing through!

21
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,810
Step aside.

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,520
What is going on?

23
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,620
   

24
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,670
   
 (T/N: Undermine Nation Ill People - To eat away at the nation and cause the people to grow ill) 

25
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,560
You failed to catch him?

26
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,900
I've searched everywhere

27
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,190
but I failed to find any trace of him.

28
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,200
It appears life has become comfortable for you.

29
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,270
Who is the one who pays for your daughter's medicine?

30
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,990
Will I have to end your daughter's life for you to do your job properly?

31
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,550
I am sorry, Your Excellency!

32
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,600
My daughter's life is in your hands, so I won't fail again!

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,380
Please trust me.

34
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,650
Come here!

35
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,890
Is there anyone inside? Open up!

36
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,660
 Is there anyone inside? Open up! 

37
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,660
- Hyungnim... Did Hyungnim come home? 
 - Yes, yes, yes...

38
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,100
Oh, Hyungnim!

39
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,270
Hyungnim! Hyungnim, Hyungnim!

40
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,010
Hyungnim...

41
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,990
Hyungnim, could we go inside for—

42
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,510
Leave my presence, all of you.

43
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,110
Yes.

44
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,200
Hyungnim, I have something to talk to you about privately inside...

45
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
Hyungnim, let us go inside... Hyungnim!

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,870
Hyungnim, you probably already know this,

47
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,950
but the rumor says the Crown Prince is bringing eunuchs and

48
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,480
court ladies from Byeokcheon into the Eastern Palace.

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,450
And that is not all.

50
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,440
As I was returning home, someone shot an arrow toward my palanquin,

51
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,100
and this was tied to it.

52
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,080
Take a look at it. "Du Guk Byeong Min." What bastard did this without having any fear?

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,120
How do I catch him so that I can relieve my anger?

54
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,060
You really don't know who those men are?

55
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,770
I am asking if you ever saw those words on the red paper before!

56
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,550
Did you get an arrow, too, Hyungnim?

57
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,240
I asked if you've never seen those four words, "Du Guk Byeong Min" before!

58
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,660
I-I-I...

59
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,730
- I-I have not. 
 - Damn you!

60
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:49,190
"Du Guk Byeong Min." You really have not seen those four words in Byeokcheon?

61
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,990
Byeokcheon...

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,830
To think I made such a pathetic and stupid bastard

63
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,090
a minister just because you're family...

64
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,560
Damn you!

65
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,130
Have you forgotten what I had to do to pay the price for making a dim-witted idiot

66
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,950
like you the governor of Byeokcheon?

67
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,950
Just so I could save you, I...

68
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,360
I remember! I remember it now!

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,370
Those bastards in Byeokcheon...

70
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,250
So those words that they wrote...

71
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,680
I-I-I-If it is "Du Guk Byeong Min"...

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,010
- Then there really is a remnant of those bastards– 
 - Damn it!

73
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,870
Hyungnim!

74
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,890
If you do not have any more questions, then I will be on my way.

75
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,210
It appears there is no one in the palace who knows anything useful.

76
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,950
There was no piece of information about Byeokcheon to take note of,

77
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,600
and none of them seemed to be lying.

78
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
Your Highness.

79
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,160
What are you trying to find out?

80
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,680
Bring a lantern and follow me.

81
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,710
Your Highness, are you going to the library?

82
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,210
Your Highness, were you looking at the moon?

83
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,480
Then, are you on your way to see the Grand Prince?

84
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,620
Watch your step.

85
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,460
What in the world are you doing?

86
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,370
I tried to move this rock, fearing that you may hit it...

87
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,870
Thus, I am blocking it with my body.

88
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,170
You think that I will not see a rock this big?

89
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,710
Follow me.

90
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,180
If I did not watch out for you, you would most definitely have tripped over that rock, Your Highness.

91
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,950
What are you thinking so deeply about that you are not even responding—

92
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,010
While you are watching my steps, do you not watch your own?

93
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,180
Who cares about my step?

94
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,290
How come you are walking to and fro without any destination?

95
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,330
If you tell me the destination...

96
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,690
By chance, do you just want to stroll?

97
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,170
I get it now.

98
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,520
Meander all you want.

99
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,550
Go wherever you please, and walk as much as you want.

100
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,490
No matter where it is, I will escort you there until you say,

101
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,120
"I am done. That is enough."

102
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,690
Shine the way properly.

103
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,010
Understood, Your Highness.

104
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,960
Do you not find the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat strange?

105
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,210
What about it do you find strange?

106
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,130
The report of the Byeokcheon's governor Jo Won Oh.

107
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,970
 The report of Jo Won Bo, who went out to suppress the rebellion. 

108
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,780
 That was it. 

109
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,850
Is not the most important thing missing?

110
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,200
 - You damn bastard! 
 - Die! 

111
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,710
There was no record of an interrogation of Song.

112
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,640
For such a terrible crime, it is only natural to demonstrate the severity of the crime.

113
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,140
But there was no interrogation?

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,750
 The rebels' leader was Byeokcheon's blacksmith, Song. 
   

115
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,590
 About forty bandits led by him stormed the Byeokcheon government office, 

116
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,050
 and attacked the officials and soldiers. 

117
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,080
Supposedly, by the time the Right State Minister arrived, the group of forty bandits

118
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,270
 had already conquered five villages nearby and set up a new nation. 

119
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,630
That means, in less than a month,

120
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,110
all the people of Byeokcheon turned into bandits and joined the rebellion.

121
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,210
Does that seem plausible?

122
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,150
- Is it not strange? 
 - But...

123
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,900
since it is written in the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat, would it not be true?

124
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,230
If...

125
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,300
that really is the truth...

126
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,190
What is wrong, Your Highness?

127
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,130
I hope that the ones who sent me the ghost's letter,

128
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,920
killed your family, and shot a poisoned arrow at me

129
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,260
are not the people from Byeokcheon.

130
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,490
Are they not also my people?

131
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,650
Your Highness, they are not your people.

132
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,330
They are rebels and bandits.

133
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Do you remember the curse written in the ghost's letter?

134
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,220
It said everyone would turn their backs on me, and I would become alone

135
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,300
and wander mad through all the land.

136
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,670
If my people...

137
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,510
are cursing me like that,

138
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,250
then would that not be so sad?

139
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,190
Is that why you, Your Highness,

140
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,980
hope that they are not the ones behind all this?

141
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,330
I did not know you were investigating the Byeokcheon case with that in mind.

142
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,200
However, do you not think the remaining bandits

143
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,340
instigated the Sabangahn case and declared "Song Ga Myeol Yi"?

144
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,090
But the report from the Minister of Justice and the words of the Right State Minister after he returned could be false.

145
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:53,630
Manyeondang's young master said he would look into the dried peony petals in the head shaman's incense burner.

146
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,350
That should act as a key to unraveling the case.

147
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,270
Does the monk ever tell us when he is coming?

148
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,410
All I do is provide him with a meal whenever he drops by.

149
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,650
A few days ago,

150
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,980
I heard there is a house where he stays whenever my master comes into the city.

151
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,820
Do you know it, by chance?

152
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,890
Is that true? I do not know about it.

153
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,570
This is the first time I'm hearing of this.

154
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,630
There is an item that came over from India, so I want to ask my master about it.

155
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,160
If he comes, please send a word to Manyeondang.

156
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,550
Yes.

157
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,510
Please do so.

158
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,950
Eunuch Go and Scholar Park, you two are here.

159
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,960
It has been a while.

160
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Is Manyeondang's young master inside?

161
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,650
He is... but it is almost like he is not, either.

162
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,180
Master! Get up!

163
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,910
Scholar Park and Eunuch Go are here.

164
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,840
I have not heard from you and was getting curious. It is nice of you to come.

165
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
What happened?

166
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,090
There is a hidden sorrow deep in my heart.

167
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,760
Although I may not be famous or renowned, I, too, am a strong, mature man.

168
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,420
I may be different, but I am not lacking.

169
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,060
Gosh.

170
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,830
Fly, woodpecker!

171
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,270
Peck at my heart!

172
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,730
He got rejected by a woman he was in marriage talks with...

173
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,940
cruelly and miserably.

174
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,450
That is why he is so out of it.

175
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,640
It has only been a few days, so he goes back and forth between being fine and weird,

176
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,820
normal and crazy, and going mad.

177
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,600
Oh, goodness...

178
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,800
You, beautiful one... do not pass by so cruelly, but comfort me also.

179
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,590
My body is weak because the spring breeze is too strong.

180
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,560
I fear that I may fall over.

181
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,070
It so happens it is snowing in the middle of the night,

182
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,610
outside the window.

183
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,120
It is snowing when the spring breeze is blowing...

184
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,600
What a complete mess.

185
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,170
Myung Jin's heart...

186
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,290
is cold...

187
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,190
Have you looked into the peony petals?

188
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,440
Yes. I heard that my master's master had visited India.

189
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,180
We are waiting to ask him, hoping we may be able to find a clue.

190
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,350
But I do not know when that master would come...

191
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,370
I mean, is that all you two care about?

192
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,600
Myung Jin's heart, Myung Jin's feelings! You do not care about that?

193
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,570
How could you be so uncaring of me!

194
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,490
Is my wounded heart, poked full of holes from the woodpecker's pecking,

195
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,650
- not important at all? 
  - Woodpecker's... 

196
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,370
That cruel woman looks like a woodpecker.

197
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,130
Oh, goodness...

198
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,500
Everyone, please leave. I want to be alone.

199
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,630
Gosh, seriously, this is so frustrating!

200
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,830
Just let it go and move on.

201
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,500
Forget it! You do not know how I feel, friend!

202
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,350
With your handsome face, would you have ever been rejected by a woman before?

203
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,490
Everyone, please leave.

204
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,980
 Young Master, are you inside? 

205
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,460
The Buddhist priest is here.

206
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,200
What?

207
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
- My master is here? 
 - Yes.

208
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,340
He is my master's master.

209
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,040
These are my friends.

210
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,380
Oh, yes, my student. Did you not say you had something to ask my master?

211
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,870
You may ask right now.

212
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,390
Well...

213
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,190
Oh, no, never mind. It was all my misunderstanding.

214
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,510
You do not need to pay attention to it.

215
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,060
There is a pretty fish living in that gourd bottle.

216
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,740
It is fascinating, right?

217
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,720
Is that not fascinating?

218
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,950
Why were you looking for me?

219
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,090
I have something I want to ask you, Master.

220
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,540
Yes.

221
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,130
It does appear to be an item

222
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,810
from India.

223
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:39,080
In India, they would pour oil mixed with various perfumes

224
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,390
on dried flower petals

225
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,170
and use it for various purposes.

226
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,470
Then, do you know what these dried peony petals are used for?

227
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,440
These are...

228
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,310
nothing special.

229
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,170
They are commonly used in incense made for

230
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,800
helping someone relax.

231
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,400
Wait, then in the process of drying—

232
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,980
Wait, you there!

233
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,580
What have you stolen, you rascal!

234
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,330
- Gosh! 
 - Oh, my!

235
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,160
- Gosh! 
 - Catch that thief!

236
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,690
Thief! Thief!

237
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Catch the thief!

238
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,850
You rascal!

239
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,250
Catch that thief!

240
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,360
Catch that thief!

241
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,950
Oh my!

242
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,890
Let me down, let me down!

243
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Open it, open it!

244
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,200
Gosh...

245
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,400
That rascal...

246
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,690
No... This precious... This expensive thing...

247
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,740
This kid did it!

248
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,300
Do you know how difficult it was to obtain this!

249
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,180
You! You little rascal!

250
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,820
You rascal! You are no better than a dog or a pig!

251
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,770
Not only did you block the path of a noble,

252
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,550
but you broke this blue-white porcelain!

253
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,330
Do you think this is easy to obtain?

254
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,260
Do you know how much this costs? This is really expensive, you rascal!

255
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,460
How about you break, too? Break!

256
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,330
Please do not get involved. They will pick on you for going out under disguise.

257
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,970
- Break! You should break too! 
 - What?

258
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,900
How could you stomp on a little child?

259
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,960
Are you all right?

260
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,220
This child did not do that on purpose.

261
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,790
How could you beat him so harshly?

262
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,590
H-How did the laws and customs of this nation end up in this pitiful state?

263
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,410
W-Who does this bastard think I am? All right.

264
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,030
Everyone, show your respect! He is the Minister of Justice.

265
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,700
 Oh, we did not know. 

266
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,780
I am sorry that I did not recognize you, Your Excellency.

267
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,450
However, could this porcelain be worth more than someone's life?

268
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,910
Although there are lowly classes, there is no such thing as a lowly life—

269
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,860
Are you, a lowly person, trying to teach me?

270
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,740
If you speak to me one more time with your lowly lips,

271
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,110
I will rip open your mouth and kill you so I can at least take your life as payment.

272
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,490
All right, say something. Go ahead and say something!

273
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,150
Hurry up! Come on!

274
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,730
Who are you?

275
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,690
Huh?

276
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,660
My apologies, Your Excellency.

277
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,090
This is my student, but he is uneducated and foolish,

278
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,230
so he dared talk to you, not realizing how great you are, Minister of Justice.

279
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:23,810
As this foolish fellow's master, I am embarrassed and apologetic.

280
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,670
However, if I think from this fellow's perspective,

281
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,480
how could he not step in when he saw this poor child

282
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,510
and can sense his difficult predicament?

283
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,340
Also, how could you tell him to shut his mouth?

284
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,090
You have a mouth for speaking.

285
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,110
If you shut people's mouths because they are lowly, young, or foolish,

286
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,790
where will you hear the people's voices, Your Excellency?

287
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,470
Whose son and what family do you belong to?

288
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,700
I do not want to use my family and my father's name in a place like this.

289
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,180
However, I will tell you my name.

290
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,110
My name is...

291
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,600
Kom Mung Jin!

292
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,600
Kom Mung... Kom Mung Jin!

293
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,690
I do not know how prestigious your family is,

294
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,180
but seeing how they educated their child so poorly, there is no point in knowing.

295
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,070
However!

296
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,560
It is the duty of adults to educate a foolish young man like him

297
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,920
who in his youthfulness lacks fear, so I will teach you.

298
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,230
Bring me that little bastard.

299
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,040
Y-Yes...

300
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,090
- Come over here! 
 - No, you cannot!

301
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,350
- Come here! 
 - Please spare me!

302
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,690
Go over there, you rascal!

303
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,060
Well, in Joseon,

304
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,630
there is something called the national law.

305
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,770
You would know that too if you read.

306
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,240
Then you would probably already know that

307
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,560
this rascal needs to compensate me for the harm done to me, right?

308
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,270
Tell him how much money I spent on that broken porcelain.

309
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,200
It was around 200 nyang.

310
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,980
 - Whoa! It costs that much? 
 - 200 nyang? 

311
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,500
Your Excellency, how could this child pay you such a large sum?

312
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,290
Then, does it not make sense for him to pay for it with his body?

313
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,520
If he were to be put in jail, about 200 years should do it.

314
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,450
P-Please spare me! Spare me!

315
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,390
Even if you were to go to my house and work all your life as a slave,

316
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,030
would you be able to pay that back?

317
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,990
Not only that, you rascal.

318
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,060
You!

319
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,280
Did you not chase this little kid?

320
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,390
I am sure I heard you yell out, "catch the thief."

321
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,060
Well...

322
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,510
I thought he had stolen something very important,

323
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,460
but it was not worth your attention, Your Excellency-

324
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,460
Did this rascal steal that?

325
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,880
Why are you not answering me?

326
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,350
Lift your head. Lift your head!

327
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,090
You... You're...

328
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,000
Who are you, and what do you do?

329
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,670
I am just a lowly man who barely scrapes by every day, Your Excellency.

330
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,700
Show us what that little kid stole from you.

331
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,880
Everyone, look here closely.

332
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,990
I am not merely doing this to take out my anger.

333
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,150
I am executing the dignified national law.

334
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,830
Bring what that kid stole over here.

335
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,840
Well, just as they say that a needle thief becomes a cow thief,

336
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
it is bastards like him who become the nation's worst thieves.

337
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,900
The traitors!

338
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,840
No!

339
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,350
This clearly counts as a crime of theft,

340
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,500
I will turn this bastard over to the Police Bureau!

341
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,020
Confucius said this,

342
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,740
"You cannot carve a rotten tree,

343
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,160
and a wall made of dirty soil cannot be repaired."

344
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:15,040
I suppose such lowly people like you would not know the words of Confucius.

345
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,730
It means there is no use in scolding bastards like him.

346
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,840
They need a scalding punishment to learn their lesson.

347
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,450
Yes, very wise of him.

348
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,930
All right, let us drag him away.

349
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,990
Yes...

350
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,940
I told you to come. Come with me!

351
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,870
You should stop, Minister of Justice.

352
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,830
Gosh, what is with today?

353
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,960
Let me down. Let me down.

354
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,810
What bastard today...

355
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,100
Fine. All right.

356
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,990
Wait...

357
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,390
How are you here...

358
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,460
Could a passing scholar say a word to you, Your Excellency?

359
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,840
Oh, a scholar? I-I suppose...

360
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,330
I watched everything from the beginning, and this child did not break the valuable porcelain

361
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,950
intentionally but it was an accident.

362
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,580
Though it was theft, it was just a few pieces of cold rice and sweet potato.

363
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,840
The law of Joseon leaves room for extenuating circumstances,

364
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,970
so how about you just let him go?

365
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,490
My title is that of the head of the Justice Department,

366
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,900
so how could I turn a blind eye toward a law-breaker like this

367
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,140
while I get paid with government money, S-Scholar?

368
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,220
Also, punishment is necessary because by punishing one person,

369
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,280
it causes ten million people to fear the law.

370
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,190
So I have no choice but to make an example out of him.

371
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,750
You are so knowledgeable about the law,

372
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,700
but you must not have read the words of Mencius.

373
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,870
You do not know anything about compassion.

374
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,740
Mencius said if you lack compassion, you are not human.

375
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,680
What that means is that if you lack a compassionate heart,

376
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,470
you are not a human being.

377
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,120
Take a look at this child.

378
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,440
Judging by his appearance, he either has no parents to take care of him,

379
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,270
or even if he did, they were unable to take care of him for some reason.

380
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,850
He probably stole because he was hungry, ran because he felt guilty about stealing,

381
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,620
and in the process, broke your porcelain, Your Excellency.

382
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,000
Well, you think I would not have compassion at all?

383
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,670
Yes, I knew you would.

384
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:11,190
However, having a compassionate heart and running to save a person in need are two things completely different.

385
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,620
Anyone can feel compassion, but it is difficult to put it into action.

386
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,840
What will you do, Your Excellency?

387
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,880
Will you just feel compassionate or put it into action?

388
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,230
Put it into action!

389
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,910
 Yeah, I agree. 

390
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Even so, he broke my valuable porcelain-

391
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,670
As I understand, blue and white porcelain ware was considered luxury items by the late kings.

392
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,880
So they banned private usage except for using them as drinking cups.

393
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,080
You are the Minister of Justice, who should be administrating the law.

394
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,040
Yet how is it that you possess the banned goods?

395
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,660
I am so curious about that.

396
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,200
Well...

397
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,070
It is okay. I do not mind keeping it a secret for you, Minister.

398
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,470
Between you and me, you know.

399
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,880
I feel compassionate toward you.

400
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,870
So I will forgive you!

401
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,830
It is a secret.

402
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,400
Let us go, let us go, let us go!

403
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,290
I will walk.

404
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,490
- Follow me! 
 - Move! Hurry!

405
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Are you all right?

406
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,800
Geez...

407
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,550
Put it here.

408
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,260
Step aside!

409
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,620
Here comes the Minister of Justice!

410
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,690
You should have done it sooner! Much sooner!

411
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,690
Step aside!

412
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,770
Did you get something to eat?

413
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,390
- Sister. 
 - Have you been starving, too?

414
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:16,720
No, I ate a lot of food.

415
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,000
I ran errands because there was a party at some lord's house.

416
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,610
I am sorry that I ate alone.

417
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,470
I am happy that you ate, at least.

418
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,460
I cannot believe he became a minister.

419
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,770
Did you know that?

420
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,360
How could that bastard be alive and well?

421
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,720
Just let it go.

422
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,920
Where are your parents?

423
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,700
I heard they passed away.

424
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,140
That is apparently why my sister piggybacked me and ran away.

425
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,140
Ran away? From where, exactly?

426
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,470
Sister said our hometown is Byeokcheon.

427
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,390
As we ran away from there, my parents

428
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,850
passed away, as I heard.

429
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,790
Use this money to get medicine for your sister.

430
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,000
I will pay in advance at the tavern from earlier.

431
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,430
Go eat there whenever you feel hungry.

432
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,230
But if I go back there and get sent to the Police Bureau again...

433
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,020
That will never happen. You can feel free to go there.

434
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,430
I live next to that tavern. Ask them and visit me anytime.

435
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,090
You heard my master's name, right?

436
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,320
It's Kim Myung Jin.

437
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,470
They are homeless children without parents. Please take good care of them.

438
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,340
I will give you more money if needed.

439
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,470
Thank you in advance.

440
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,070
Y-Yes.

441
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,120
See you next time.

442
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,800
- Thank you in advance. 
 - Yes.

443
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,220
Oh, boy, that Fellow...

444
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,370
The more I see him, the more I like him.

445
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,040
He is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.

446
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,800
His exterior is crispy, but he is soft inside.

447
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,940
Do you not think so, Student?

448
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes, it seems so.

449
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,700
I like that Scholar Park.

450
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,410
I think you are... not so bad, either.

451
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,020
Your Highness was right.

452
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,940
Byeokcheon could not just have bandits.

453
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,870
Even if those homeless children belonged to the bandits,

454
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,630
they did not do anything wrong.

455
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,410
It is so nice to see us standing side by side.

456
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,480
I meant the shadow. Were you not looking at that?

457
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,010
We look friendly. Do you not think so?

458
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,390
Do not cling to me!

459
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,650
I did not cling. It was the shadow.

460
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,770
I told you not to cling.

461
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,560
Just go your way! Why are you doing this?

462
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,720
I am on my way. This is my way.

463
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,570
Seriously!

464
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,500
Do not follow me.

465
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,620
- It is an order. 
 - Yes.

466
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,970
 Hong Je Yong, a citizen of Byeokcheon 

467
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,100
 is writing to you on behalf of the poor people of Byeokcheon. 

468
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,960
 Jo Won Oh, the governor of Byeokcheon, is someone who eats the country away 

469
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,810
 and makes the people ill. I could not help but report this to you. 

470
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,320
Du Guk Byeong Min... 
  (T/N: Du Guk Byeong Min: Eat the country away and make the people ill) 

471
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,630
   

472
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,420
Du Guk Byeong Min...

473
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,930
   

474
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,500
Did somebody survive?

475
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,560
 The rumor says the Crown Prince is bringing 

476
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,410
 eunuchs and court ladies from Byeokcheon into the Eastern Palace. 

477
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,140
   

478
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,010
Your Majesty, I, Jo Won Bo, 
    

479
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,570
wish to clearly reveal the evil doings of the rest of the rebels from Byeokcheon.

480
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,340
That is why I dared to present that irreverent letter to you, Sire.

481
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,180
Tell me where you got this letter immediately.

482
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,200
I am ashamed to report this, but when the former head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau

483
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,430
announced her horrible curse,

484
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,020
that letter, which contains the same curse, was spread to the people of the capital.

485
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,170
"The Song family will destroy the Yi family."

486
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,920
Your Majesty, Joseon's law says an anonymous letter must be burnt

487
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,850
after reading, even if it is regarding the country's affairs and not speaking of the content.

488
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,010
But how could it be considered an anonymous letter if it is clear who wrote it?

489
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,610
The head shaman mentioned the name Song, the bandit of Byeokcheon,

490
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,930
and admitted that she was one of them.

491
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,330
Do you mean their people are outside the palace as well?

492
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,530
I believe you must prevent anyone from Byeokcheon from being given

493
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,380
any government position, so we do not hear of Byeokcheon anymore.

494
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,390
Please stop them from holding office.

495
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,230
Ban the people from Byeokcheon from applying for the state exam.

496
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,910
Where is Byeokcheon? It is in the West.

497
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,330
That region is close to where the barbarians are, and they are uneducated.

498
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:52,190
Even the former king left an instruction not to hire people from that region.

499
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,920
How could a minister of a nation be worse than a street ruffian?

500
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,860
Chief State Minister, we need to find a way to stop them.

501
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,110
How could we stop them? If you have an idea, let us hear it.

502
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,580
You know His Majesty.

503
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,280
If someone gets in his way, he abandons them no matter how faithful of a servant they are.

504
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,450
He saw that evil letter.

505
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,960
He must be already leaning toward the Right State Minister.

506
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,330
Master! There is a notice from the palace!

507
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,060
They will prevent the people from Byeokcheon from applying for the

508
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,130
state exams and getting any government positions!

509
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,500
What on earth...

510
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,030
Get out of the way!

511
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,170
Those poor people from Byeokcheon. 
    

512
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,890
- They are banned from holding office! 
 - That is what they deserve.

513
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,440
Have you not been to Byeokcheon?

514
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,310
It was totally filled with bandits.

515
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,190
If you have not gotten your bundle stolen there, you cannot be considered a peddler!

516
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,780
You are right. You are right.

517
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,880
My cousin took in someone who ran away from Byeokcheon as a slave out of pity,

518
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,720
and he got everything in his storage shed stolen!

519
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,720
They say not to hire anyone from Byeokcheon,

520
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,950
not even as a slave because they lie and steal all the time!

521
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,340
Even if there were bandits in Byeokcheon,

522
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,040
did they not get wiped out 10 years ago?

523
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,040
They might have changed their names and lived in hiding somewhere. Who knows?

524
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,030
Let me do some face reading.

525
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,470
Are you... from Byeokcheon by chance?

526
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,690
What are you talking about?

527
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,940
Your joke is way out of line!

528
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,380
Just forget it if you are not! Why are you getting so angry?

529
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,030
I think there is at least one person from Byeokcheon among us.

530
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,170
Let me do some face reading. Let us see, let us see...

531
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,970
What? What is up with your eyes?

532
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,110
- Let go! 
 - It is me.

533
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,130
- Let go! 
 - I am from Byeokcheon!

534
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,560
Huh?

535
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,930
Did everyone see that? Take a good look and spread the news!

536
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,190
That Kim Myung Jin, the youngest son of the Chief State Minister, is from Byeokcheon!

537
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,320
Have you not seen me in Byeokcheon?

538
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,400
You know me, do you not? Long time no see!

539
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,460
You crazy bastard!

540
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,030
- You are a freaking lunatic! 
 - What the hell?

541
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,860
- What do you mean? 
 - Are you serious right now?

542
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:54,990
Your Highness, one of the bedchamber court ladies wishes to see you.

543
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:56,990
What is it regarding?

544
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,990
Please let me see His Highness for a second!

545
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,520
This is so unfair! Why are you doing this?

546
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,840
- Please let me see His Highness for a moment! 
 - Leave.

547
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,660
These eunuchs and court ladies are getting kicked out for being from Byeokcheon.

548
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,200
I have lived in the palace for over 30 years.

549
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,800
I was not even there when the bandits flooded into Byeokcheon!

550
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,380
But you are kicking me out for being from Byeokcheon?

551
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,680
That is so unfair, is it not?

552
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,100
I am not the one who set the plum tree on fire.

553
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,020
Why do you kick me out, Your Highness?

554
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,000
Please help me!

555
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,800
You are the only one I can implore!

556
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:42,610
The Crown Prince called me the other day. So I just answered his questions truthfully.

557
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:46,950
I really did not do anything, Your Highness!

558
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,660
Forgive me, Your Highness.

559
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,620
Get her out of here!

560
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,540
Your Highness, Your Highness!

561
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,420
Stop!

562
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,950
   

563
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,700
I...

564
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,320
have no place to go.

565
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,250
What power could I have?

566
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,050
If you hang in there,

567
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,600
we will see each other again.

568
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,700
Please summon me to return, Your Highness.

569
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,170
   

570
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,600
It is His Majesty's order!

571
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,790
My goodness...

572
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,610
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

573
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,800
Your Highness the Crown Prince!

574
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:53,950
Did you want to see me that day to ultimately do this?

575
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,310
I told you I do not know anything about Byeokcheon nor the remaining rebels!

576
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,400
This is so unfair, Your Highness!

577
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,690
Please do not abandon me, Your Highness!

578
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,590
Your Highness! Your Highness,

579
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,530
please help us! Your Highness!

580
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,890
Take them.

581
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,300
 - Your Highness! 
 - Please, Your Highness! 

582
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,380
 - Your Highness! 
 - I did not do anything! 

583
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,800
I do not know of anything!

584
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,140
I never told you a lie, Your Highness!

585
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,840
Your Highness!

586
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,980
Your Highness!

587
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,680
Get them out of here!

588
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,280
I will go to His Highness.

589
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,080
   

590
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:02,800
They all lost their positions overnight and got kicked out of the palace?

591
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,650
   

592
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,990
   

593
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,930
Your Highness,

594
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,070
have you been reviewing the directories of civil service examinees due to the Byeokcheon incident?

595
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,530
Since Right State Minister defeated the rebels of Byeokcheon,

596
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:28,500
there were only three people from Byeokcheon who passed

597
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,380
the civil service exam in the past decade.

598
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,350
Same with the military service exam.

599
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,730
Even if they passed, they were assigned to the countryside or islands.

600
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,000
So they had to leave Hanyang.

601
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,130
Now they cannot even take the state exams.

602
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,770
What should we do about this?

603
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,750
Father, please rescind the decision to ban people from Byeokcheon from taking the state exam.

604
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:07,730
This decision will put countless people from Byeokcheon's lives on the brink.

605
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,650
The eunuchs and court ladies who got kicked out for being from Byeokcheon,

606
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,500
and the government officials who lost their positions should be dealt with first.

607
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,460
I looked at the list of people who passed the state exam in the past decade.

608
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,560
   

609
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,190
 Since Byeokcheon became the symbol of rebellion, 

610
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:35,150
 they were discriminated against and prevented from being appointed or promoted 

611
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,670
 because of Bungwan System* even if they passed the exam. 
 (Appointed to difference offices based on age and ability) 

612
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,420
 Crown Prince. 

613
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,540
 Do you disregard what I said about the Crown Prince not getting involved in politics? 

614
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,470
- Looks like His Highness is here. I will wait. 
   - During the rebellion ten years ago, 

615
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:52,690
 they were executed without a hearing, let alone three hearings as the law dictates. 

616
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,000
Father, the report from the government official does not tell the whole truth.

617
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,600
You must get the to bottom of this and clarify everything.

618
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,930
If you do not correct the past, the loyal subjects will have nothing to rely on,

619
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,940
and the treacherous subjects will continue with their evil conduct.

620
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,590
Enough!

621
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,030
 That is enough. 

622
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,580
 "You only believe the treacherous subjects. It is an unjust situation. 

623
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,690
 You must correct things." 

624
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:24,770
Crown Prince, are you giving me this long speech

625
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,040
to say that I made the wrong decision?

626
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,780
- I... 
 - How dare the Crown Prince of Joseon

627
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,310
defend the army of bandits who stirred up the country?

628
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,850
 How come you only believe the Jo family of Seongju? 

629
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,610
Your Majesty, the Right State Minister is here!

630
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:11,330
I have something to tell my father. You had better leave, Minister.

631
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:26,100
If so, I will come by next time.

632
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,660
You, how dare you butt in?

633
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:07,490
   

634
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,150
   

635
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,060
I told you not to confront the Right State Minister. Why are you so reckless?

636
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:24,820
Countless crown princes were harmed for getting involved in politics even before taking the throne.

637
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,120
The Right State Minister is not an easy person.

638
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,800
He is not someone you can handle.

639
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:35,020
Do you think he is only targeting the Left State Minister's family to tear them up?

640
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,150
Do you truly not know that he can point his arrow at you as well?

641
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,960
If so,

642
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,110
what am I supposed to do?

643
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:51,130
Should I just live as a puppet and secure my position?

644
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,450
If I have to be a puppet,

645
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,280
it is a meaningless position, is it not?

646
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,700
If you cannot get past empathy and compassion,

647
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,470
you will end up dead. Did I not tell you?

648
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:07,670
If so, are you on the throne only to survive?

649
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,630
You wretch!

650
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,390
Have you been considering me

651
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,550
as such an inadequate king all this time?

652
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,560
I asked you if you

653
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,420
have been considering me as such an insignificant king.

654
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,360
Crown Prince!

655
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,670
Answer me.

656
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,000
You told me to doubt, doubt again,

657
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,980
and not trust anyone. That is why.

658
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,830
I rejected the ones near me and even friends.

659
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,760
I nearly died trying to do my best not to give any affection to anyone.

660
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,180
However...

661
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,110
when I look at you, I have no idea what

662
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:14,860
I tried to...

663
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,220
protect so desperately.

664
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,370
Because I was given a position that was not mine,

665
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,360
because...

666
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,260
I dared to take my hyungnim's position,

667
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,700
I, at least...

668
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,740
I, at least, wanted to become the Crown Prince whom Hyungnim would not be ashamed of.

669
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:42,090
That is why I tried so hard to listen to you and worked hard.

670
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,900
But I feel ashamed right now.

671
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,080
I am ashamed that I just sit here like a puppet.

672
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,290
How come...

673
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:03,590
you make me feel so ashamed, Father...

674
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,480
King.

675
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:31,300
You can only secure the throne by abandoning the Crown Prince.

676
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:01,470
There is a nighttime lecture today. Get ready, so we do not run late.

677
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,990
I am deeply sorry, Your Highness.

678
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:36,310
His Majesty ordered you not to step outside of the Eastern Palace.

679
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,690
Before there is another order, you may not visit the King's Palace, the Queen's Palace.

680
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:45,580
And you are banned from participating in the morning study, evening study, daytime, and nighttime lectures.

681
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:51,920
His Majesty also ordered the masters of Prince Training Hall not to enter the palace, Your Highness.

682
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,000
Your Highness!

683
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,480
 Your Highness! 

684
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,110
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

685
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,870
Open it.

686
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,980
Open the door right now!

687
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,350
Forgive me, Your Highness!

688
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:31,440
 Forgive us, Your Highness! 

689
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,310
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

690
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,460
Your Highness!

691
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,000
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

692
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,400
You cannot, Your Highness!

693
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,380
Your Highness!

694
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,070
Forgive us, Your Highness.

695
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:07,500
You cannot step outside the Eastern Palace.

696
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:14,180
Also, His Majesty only allowed a eunuch to enter your room so others cannot go in and out frequently.

697
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,850
 It has been ten days since His Highness was trapped inside 

698
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,200
 the Eastern Palace. 

699
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,130
 Today is the 15th day. 

700
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,610
 There is nothing I can do for His Highness. 

701
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,580
How come we do not hear from the palace?

702
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,910
Did His Highness forget about us?

703
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,730
Gosh...

704
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,180
There is no way!

705
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,400
Scholar Park is not coming, and neither is Eunuch Go.

706
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,460
I miss them.

707
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,300
Do you not?

708
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,790
- Yes. 
 - Geez!

709
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:10,930
The four of us should be drinking on a night like this!

710
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,900
Yippee, whoopee, hurray! Hurray!

711
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,820
- How nice! 
 - How nice!

712
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,230
The weather is so nice.

713
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:39,760
 Today is the 20th day since I saw His Highness. 

714
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,490
 His Highness has been confined in the Eastern Palace 

715
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,440
 for a month. 

716
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:35,390
 His Highness, are you enduring all right? 

717
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:47,550
His Highness. It is way past your bedtime.

718
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,250
Do you know what

719
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,060
the crown prince's duties are?

720
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,020
What are they?

721
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,550
Moon Chim Shi Seon.

722
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,120
It is also called Woon Jung Shin Sung. 
  (T/N: The crown prince's duty to greet the king and queen) 

723
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,750
I ask how the king and queen are

724
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,380
and inspect royal meals.

725
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:20,050
Do you know what else is there?

726
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,040
Attend the law lecture review sessions and polish your studies.

727
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,800
However,

728
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,800
Father banned me from doing any of that.

729
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,320
How could I be considered a crown prince?

730
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,870
I cannot do anything.

731
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,120
All the things that the crown prince can do.

732
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,580
I cannot do any of those things.

733
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:07,140
How could I be the crown prince anymore?

734
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,860
I am already...

735
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,320
a fallen crown prince.

736
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,730
 I think Father is trying to abandon me. 

737
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:08,880
If he is not,

738
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,420
he cannot be doing this.

739
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:54,100


740
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:06,800
♫  Your cry is steeped in pain  ♫

741
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:13,120
♫  The words you swallowed  ♫

742
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,710
♫  Tell me everything  ♫

743
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:25,270
♫  The world has coldly  ♫

744
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,990
   

745
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:32,070
 Was it true that the Crown Prince is confined in the Eastern Palace? 

746
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:34,310
 It means he has been ousted. 

747
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,760
 I know that you are not Go Soon Dol. 

748
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,700
 You cannot trust this person. 

749
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,370
 Who is whose mother, exactly? 

750
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,960
 What are you doing right now? 

751
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,900
 Your Highness, you must oust this person! 

752
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,860
 Did you also kill my family? 

753
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,430
 I can protect you, and you can protect me. 

754
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,780
 The herald who came to Gaeseong. 

755
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,880
 It was him.
