1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,790
   

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,510
   

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,080
   

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,520
   

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,990
   

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,400
   

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,510
   

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,780
   

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:47,000


10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,000
There are rumors that the Crown Prince is confined in the Eastern Palace.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,520
I, too, heard the Confucian scholars talk about it.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,650
I thought it was just a rumor, but is it true?

13
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,540
Have you ever seen your father talk about the matters of the Royal Court?

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,550
Speaking of which, my wife...

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,440
since the Royal Court is chaotic right now,

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,480
I am thinking of stepping down and going down to my hometown

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,470
to just do some farming.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,310
Let's eat.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,230
    
 His Highness is confined.

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,150
Is that why I have not heard from him recently?

21
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,190
Come on now, watch where you are going.

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,770
Actually, never mind.

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,910
I should be the one to be more watchful, not you. I am sorry.

24
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,900
Please do not get angry so early in the morning.

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,490
Oh! It has been so long!

26
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,990
Wait.

27
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,100
Do you not know me?

28
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,600
Me, me, me! It is Manyeondang's Kim Myung Jin!

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,180
- Yes. 
 - But why is your attire...

30
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,960
Are you out on a secret mission for His Highness? Does he have any message for me, by chance?

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,380
I heard that His Highness was confined to the Eastern Palace—

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,090
How could I dare disclose matters of the Palace with you? I'll be on my way.

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,460
Why is he being like that?

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,800
Gosh, something is strange.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,700
His Highness was confined to the Eastern Palace and

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,090
that officer is walking the streets under disguise?

37
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,740
Yes. Unless something major happened to His Highness...

38
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,080
Then what about Eunuch Go?

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,150
Are you worried about Eunuch Go right now? Do you not know what confinement is?

40
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,480
His Highness has been confined, so who would have confined him?

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,780
That would mean it was the King who confined him.

42
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,500
His Highness does not have people to protect him as is.

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,940
Now his own father, the King, appears to be abandoning him.

44
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,930
How could you worry only about Eunuch Go?

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,320
I will go and change the books that His Highness has read.

46
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,080
Gosh, my stomach...

47
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,470
After eating so much dried persimmon, two days ago, my stomach hurts a lot.

48
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,340
What are you doing? Hurry up and go to the outhouse.

49
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,190
The dried persimmons are blocking my bowels so well

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,090
that it does not come out even when I sit there.

51
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,580
But still, I will go and try once more.

52
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,980
This time, it may take a long time.

53
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,420
I will definitely succeed in bowel movements this time.

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,070
 Look for Park Han Soo, who was the officer in charge of the military ten years ago. 

55
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,410
 He was one of the five commanders who went with Jo Won Bo to put down the rebellion in Byeokcheon, 

56
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,080
 and the only one who had no connection to the Jo family of Seongju. 

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,670
 Ask him what happened in Byeokcheon ten years ago. 

58
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,340
You know how to read?

59
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,670
Are you joking?

60
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,030
I may not look the part, but I passed the military officer exam.

61
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,290
How disrespectful you are to someone who is talented in both, literary and martial arts!

62
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,430
But why do I feel like you only understood half of it and were just nodding?

63
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,890
How dare you! Geez!

64
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,690
You should eat so you can recover your strength.

65
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,950
Just eat one spoonful.

66
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,130
What are we to do with you in this state when Orabeoni is under confinement as well?

67
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,620
What do you mean, Hyungnim is in confinement?

68
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,640
Never mind. You do not need to worry about any of that.

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,700
Please eat this, at least.

70
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,110
Your playing of the geomungo is always beautiful to hear, Queen.

71
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,680
Your Majesty,

72
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,530
I heard that the Crown Prince asked you to withdraw your decree regarding Byeokcheon.

73
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,270
Do you also know what happened in Byeokcheon ten years ago?

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,810
A group of bandits in Byeokcheon started a rebellion and my uncle personally went to put it down.

75
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,490
I am also a woman of the Jo family of Seongju, but I am your wife.

76
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,400
Also, I am well aware of my uncle's fiery personality and greed.

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,340
If you want to fight against my uncle, please stay far away from me.

78
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,380
If I do not have you, where will I find peace and comfort

79
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,230
in this vacant space of the palace?

80
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,020
I will not let go of your hand.

81
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,520
Also, do not worry about the Right State Minister.

82
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,340
I am not that dumb.

83
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,660
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince, is the foundation of this nation.

84
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,620
Already a month has passed since the Crown Prince has been confined.

85
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,200
The eunuchs and palace workers are talking about the Crown Prince's confinement.

86
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,290
Please restore the dignity of the Crown Prince now, Your Majesty.

87
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,260
Is it true that you asked His Majesty to release the Crown Prince

88
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,230
from his confinement?

89
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,840
I am sure His Majesty is not at peace about having to confine his son.

90
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,780
As his mother, my heart is breaking, too.

91
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,530
Mother? Who is whose mother, exactly?

92
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,000
All of you, please leave.

93
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,950
Mother?

94
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Whose mother are you saying you are?

95
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,760
The only son you have is Grand Prince Myung Ahn.

96
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,560
Have you forgotten that?

97
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,060
Having sat on this seat,

98
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,720
do you also want to act the part of the Crown Prince's mother?

99
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,070
You should not do this.

100
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,810
The one...

101
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,380
who got you to the Queen's Palace is the Jo family and me, you wench.

102
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,810
It is not the Crown Prince and the King.

103
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:37,710
Engrave it onto your bones for whom you should be sitting on that seat.

104
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,520
Do you understand, Your Highness?

105
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,010
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

106
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,360
Your Highness!

107
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,800
You should not do this, Your Highness!

108
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Just leave it be.

109
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,140
Your Highness...

110
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,990
No, Your Highness...

111
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,570
By chance, are you planning on jumping the walls this time?

112
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,110
This is an important and confidential matter, so we must not make any mistakes.

113
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,140
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,640
   

115
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,650
 Your Majesty, the Right State Minister is here! 

116
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,650
Look who this is. You are the Eastern Palace's...

117
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,480
I am Eunuch Go Soon Dol.

118
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,540
Go Soon Dol...

119
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,330
Where are you going in such a rush?

120
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,910
Are you on an errand for His Highness?

121
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,160
Since your master is locked up,

122
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,710
you must be so busy since you are loyal to him.

123
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,720
Yes, well... That is so.

124
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,670
Since I have somewhere to rush off to, I will—

125
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,790
Come now.

126
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,340
Your Excellency, why do you stop me?

127
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,510
Did His Highness give you a letter?

128
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,240
Since he is locked up, I suppose he would need to write letters.

129
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,790
Who did he ask you to deliver it to?

130
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,490
How is it that the Crown Prince does not understand His Majesty's heart?

131
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,370
His Majesty had him confined in the Eastern Palace

132
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,890
so that he would not get involved in politics.

133
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,090
- Hand it over. 
 - I cannot.

134
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,530
How could I dare disobey my master's orders?

135
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,060
Must I search your body for it?

136
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,210
Surely, there is a letter in these books.

137
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,250
That is not so!

138
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I know that you are not Go Soon Dol.

139
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,750
How could you say such a thing, Your Excellency?

140
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,980
If I am not Go Soon Dol, then who would I be?

141
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
How about you tell me?

142
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,340
Do you know why I am just letting you be,

143
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,320
even though I know you are not Go Soon Dol?

144
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,520
Getting to know whom His Highness keeps close to him

145
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,870
is also part of my enjoyment.

146
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,390
Before I start searching through each of these books myself, hand over the letter peaceably.

147
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,340
I cannot! Please let me go!

148
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,660
Your Excellency!

149
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,930
What kind of profane behavior is this?

150
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,430
Did a vassal really dare try to steal His Highness's letter?

151
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,480
Well...

152
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,580
I was trying to help His Highness if he needed anything while he was locked up.

153
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,850
You know the saying, "One Leaf, Know Autumn."

154
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,120
They say you can know from one leaf falling that Autumn has come.

155
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,330
How could I not fear your rash behaviors today

156
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,120
as a sign of things to come?

157
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,290
"One Leaf, Know Autumn," you say...

158
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,210
Sergeant, how could you determine the future based on just one fact?

159
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,940
Also, how am I His Highness's vassal?

160
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,500
A vassal must only be loyal to the King alone.

161
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,590
It appears that there are two kings in your heart, Sergeant!

162
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,160
- Is that really so? 
 - Your Excellency!

163
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,080
What kind of leap to conclusion is that!

164
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Sergeant...

165
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,870
be careful.

166
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,770
With every step you take,

167
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,470
and every word that you speak, be careful

168
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,350
and very careful.

169
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,530
If you do not want me to find your flaws,

170
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,270
you will have to do so.

171
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,350
I will see you again, Eunuch Go.

172
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,450
You must have been so scared. Are you all right?

173
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,300
I am fine now.

174
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,480
By chance, was that letter

175
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,200
written by His Highness for me?

176
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,760
    

177
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,660
I was looking for a way to get His Highness out anyway.

178
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,700
Tell him I will do as he had ordered.

179
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,510
Yes, Sir.

180
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,750
Your Highness, I brought some new books.

181
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,280
   

182
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,320
Are these not the same books you took earlier?

183
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,170
No, they are different books.

184
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,410
How could you think of such a plan?

185
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,170
I will also go with the Sergeant.

186
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,870
Go ahead.

187
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,240
But, Your Highness,

188
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,500
the Right State Minister told me

189
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,950
that he knows I am not Go Soon Dol.

190
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,780
There are many in the Palace who are the ears and feet of the Right State Minister.

191
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,460
However, do not worry.

192
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,140
Even if he knows you are not Go Soon Dol, he would never guess you are Min Jae Yi.

193
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,850
If he knew that, he would not hesitate to use that information.

194
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,240
I wonder... if he knows but is saving it for later.

195
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,250
I would have died already if I did not come to you.

196
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,690
How could I not have expected trouble while wearing a eunuch's uniform as a woman?

197
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,170
However, I fear you may face difficulties because of me...

198
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,280
If I face difficulties,

199
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,250
- would it break your heart? 
 - How could it not?

200
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,800
If you face difficulties because of me,

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,510
I will die from the pain of heartbreak.

202
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,810
I will also be the same.

203
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,490
Thus, I can protect you,

204
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,530
and you can protect me.

205
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,370
We must make sure to be safe for each other's sake.

206
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
   

207
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,810
Park Han Soo.

208
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,340
It has been a long time since he quit. Has it been about ten years?

209
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,880
I think it was right after he went to put down the rebellion at Byeokcheon.

210
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,160
By chance, do you know the reason he quit?

211
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,690
If I suddenly landed so much money like that, I would also quit and enjoy my life.

212
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,120
Around ten years ago, his father's first cousin died,

213
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,820
and he bequeathed all his inheritance to Park Han Soo, for he did not have any children.

214
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,320
And his wealth was enormous,so he bought all of the rice fields in Mapo.

215
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,310
Some people are just lucky...

216
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,010
Has anyone seen him recently?

217
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,550
I heard his nephew works at a horse stable in the West.

218
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,770
But why are you asking?

219
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,910
Why do you keep smiling?

220
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:34,770
The fact that I can do something for you makes me so happy, Your Highness.

221
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,380
Make sure to return before the sun sets.

222
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:47,270
Yes. How lonely would you feel if I were not here when I used to be always by your side?

223
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,400
I also want to see Manyeondang's young master and his student,

224
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,200
but I will restrain myself and come back quickly.

225
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,900
All right. Try turning around.

226
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,290
Wow! My student!

227
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,950
Now that I have dressed you like this, you look so fancy!

228
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,530
Really?

229
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,990
But, Master.

230
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,010
Is it true that you were expelled from Sungkyunkwan?

231
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,680
W-Who is going around saying such nonsense?

232
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,770
The slave at your home, Master.

233
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,340
I heard it when I took you home while you were drunk a while ago.

234
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
That bastard knows it incorrectly!

235
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,310
It is not that Sungkyunkwan kicked me out. I took Sungkyunkwan out of my life.

236
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,960
Pardon me?

237
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,120
From long ago, a grand desire in Myung Jin's heart was to know about everything in the world.

238
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,470
Sungkyunkwan was not enough to fulfill that grand desire.

239
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,140
I did not want to waste my precious time being stuck in that small cage,

240
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,580
so I had to escape and run out into the world.

241
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,930
I could only breathe by researching and exploring everything in the world.

242
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,600
Oh, Myung Jin, the fate of being a genius is so lonely.

243
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,120
You are so cool, Master.

244
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,620
You are truly amazing!

245
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,680
Oh, wait just a moment.

246
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,410
Researching the world...

247
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,520
Here.

248
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,660
   

249
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,660
All right, that is it. It is this look.

250
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,070
It is perfect!

251
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,020
Then, this student of yours will enjoy going around Banchon today.

252
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,780
Yes. Go ahead and enjoy to your heart's content!

253
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,300
Yes!

254
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,160
Give me some more ink.

255
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,890
Wait...

256
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,160
 Please buy this... 

257
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,700
How beautiful.

258
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,150
I mean, what is this used for?

259
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,920
Let us go.

260
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,500
 Gosh, so many people... 

261
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,190
 Return to your leader and tell him that I am not the culprit. 

262
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,660
It is a pretty ribbon, good for a gift.

263
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,920
I will sell it to you for cheap, so take it.

264
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,350
No, I am only taking a look because it is a pretty color.

265
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,990
I am a bit late. Did you wait a long time?

266
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,950
No, I just arrived as well.

267
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,470
How come a man like you were looking at a ribbon?

268
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,620
Oh, well...

269
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,070
I have a sister, and I thought it would look good on her.

270
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,260
You have a sister, I see.

271
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,820
Then, how come you did not buy it?

272
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,700
That is what I mean! Please take it.

273
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,390
It's okay. I did not bring any money with me today.

274
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,220
How much is it? I will pay for it, so give me one.

275
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,110
No, it is fine, Sir.

276
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,340
You do not get to come out of the Palace often.

277
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,290
Use this opportunity to give this to your sister.

278
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,440
Friend! It has been so long!

279
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,050
What brings you to Banchon?

280
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,600
I had someone I needed to meet. Have you been well?

281
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:56,920
Did you hear the rumor that the Crown Prince will attend the Royal Archery Event this time?

282
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,190
Wait, is His Highness really participating in the Royal Archery Event?

283
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,690
Of course!

284
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,030
Last year, he could not attend it because he had his arm.

285
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,910
But this year, he has fully recovered!

286
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,430
- Nobody said anything like that. 
 - I did not hear it, either.

287
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,140
Come now! What do you mean no one said so? I heard it yesterday, too!

288
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,880
You see!

289
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,110
Even this Confucian scholar says he heard it, too!

290
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,010
That is right. I definitely heard it.

291
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,330
His Highness will definitely participate in the upcoming Royal Archery Event.

292
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,880
- It is good that we know about it now. 
 - That is good!

293
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,370
- Yes, that is good. 
 - Now, now...

294
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,380
Since there may be other scholars who have not heard like you,you should spread the word!

295
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,470
Since it is good news, spread it far and wide!

296
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,670
 Let us go! 

297
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,160
 Spread the good news! 

298
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,900
- Pay for the meal before you go. 
 - See you again.

299
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,680
Let us go! Go on ahead quickly!

300
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,780
Then, I guess the rumor of his confinement must not be true.

301
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,970
I guess so. I wonder where such a profane rumor started.

302
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,280
How did you think of such a plan? You must be a genius, Master.

303
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,570
- Did you just realize that now? 
 - Yes!

304
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,790
Have I not told you many times before? Although I have a lot of fear-

305
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,830
Stop.

306
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,140
How dare you spread groundless rumors about His Highness?

307
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,080
I mean, all we did was hear rumors, so...

308
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,880
How could you hear rumors when you are not Confucian scholars in Sungkyunkwan?

309
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,060
Master! Do something...

310
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,840
What do you mean we are not Confucian scholars!

311
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,250
If we are not Confucian scholars, where would we have gotten these clothes?

312
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:17,250
I guess you stole the clothes of the first and second sons of the Chief State Minister.

313
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,120
Do you know me?

314
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,960
I was not sure, but it appears you are the youngest son of the Chief State Minister.

315
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,500
I am! I stole the clothes that my hyungnims wore while they were Confucian scholars—

316
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,170
No! I did not steal the clothes but only borrowed them!

317
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,440
W-W-What! Is that s-so wrong?

318
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,800
You were expelled from Sungkyunkwan, yet pretended to be a scholar, spreading groundless rumors.

319
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,150
How is that not wrong?

320
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,570
What does being expelled mean?

321
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,300
- It means he was kicked out. 
 - Pardon?

322
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,100
Hey, Master! Did you lie to me?

323
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,770
I should have known. You spoke too long about it.

324
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,030
The lonely fate of a born genius, my foot!

325
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,840
You are so cruel! Who are you that you would expose my wounds

326
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,400
and rip apart Myung Jin's heart relentlessly like this?

327
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:07,100
I was a Confucian scholar at Sungkyunkwan when you got expelled, so, of course, I'd know all too well.

328
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,180
Sergeant!

329
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,190
- Eunuch Go! 
 - What brings you here?

330
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,710
You know them, Eunuch Go?

331
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,540
You know that cruel man?

332
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,620
Where did Scholar Park go, and you are going around with this scary scholar?

333
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,320
Who is Scholar Park?

334
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,230
Well...

335
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,060
All right, since it has come to this, let us introduce each other.

336
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,760
He is the Sergeant.

337
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Just like you at Manyeondang, he serves His Highness—

338
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,730
The Sergeant of the Defense Ministry?

339
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,760
Friend!

340
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,280
What are you saying?

341
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,220
My mother's friend's son, who mastered the Thousand-Character Classic when he was four.

342
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,030
My mother's friend's son, who picked up a sword while others picked up their spoons.

343
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,930
My mother's close friend's son...

344
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,090
My mother's friend's son.

345
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,680
That is right.I heard that our mothers are close friends.

346
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,960
Why did you have to be so awesome and torture me all my life, Friend!

347
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,390
Does it make any sense for you to become the Sergeant, a blue-robe position, at your age!

348
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,920
The Sergeant...

349
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,850
 My Lady's fiancé! 

350
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,390
Be sorry! Do you know how many sons in Hanyang are

351
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,960
being beaten by their mothers with a broom and being compared to you!

352
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,370
Please be awesome to a certain extent! It aches just thinking about it.

353
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,940
All right.

354
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Now, you should explain yourself.

355
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,500
Why were you doing that?

356
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,760
   

357
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,550
It was to get the Crown Prince out of the Eastern Palace?

358
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,790
Is it not a clever plan?

359
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,400
It also lines up pretty well with the plan that we have.

360
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,570
Well, we will see.

361
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,240
I do not know if the one who needs to cooperate the most with us will do so.

362
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,840
Pardon?

363
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,600
Here.

364
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,860
Nice to meet you.

365
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,770
Who is this?

366
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,240
He is a eunuch from the Eastern Palace.

367
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,600
I am Eunuch Go Soon Dol.

368
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,330
Oh, Eunuch Go of the Eastern Palace?

369
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,670
Are you not a famous person?

370
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,620
I heard he really put a wrinkle on your reputation on the Sabangahn case, Sergeant.

371
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,090
How could you say something like that?

372
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,070
That is true. He is full of talents.

373
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,570
Would the Crown Prince keep just anybody by his side?

374
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:52,560
Why did you ask to see me, Sergeant, even bringing along a eunuch from the Eastern Palace?

375
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,860
His Highness told me to deliver a message to you, Officer.

376
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,050
A message from His Highness?

377
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,060
To me?

378
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,710
So...

379
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,770
His Highness asks us to stir things up

380
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,470
to help him end his confinement and come out of the Eastern Palace.

381
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,770
Is that the message that His Highness told you to deliver to me?

382
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,460
Yes.

383
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,930
I guess His Highness did not know this, but my family is the Jo family of Seongju.

384
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,060
He knows that very well.

385
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,980
Yet, he told us to deliver this message to you.

386
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,900
Was it an order or a request?

387
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,010
I delivered the message. That is up to you to decide now.

388
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,460
In Joseon, we respect reformation, encourage wise sages,

389
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,900
and we were always devoted to making schools flourish,

390
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,050
and nurturing scholars.

391
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,800
Therefore, the former King

392
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,820
even got a library named Jongyyunggak built. 
  (T/N: Jongyyunggak: A palace that kept books from Sungkyunkwan Institute) 

393
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,660
However, now, Jongyunggak lacks books of quality

394
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,930
 and it is not serving its purpose. 

395
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,140
 We are sincerely concerned about the future of Sungkyunkwan Institute. 

396
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,710
 But I heard the Crown Prince's library is equipped with quality books 

397
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,440
 from all places regardless of borders. 

398
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,120
If you open up His Highness's library and allow for transcribing,

399
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,230
it will certainly be helpful for Confucian scholars' studies.

400
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,040
We request the Crown Prince to attend the Royal Archery Event

401
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,470
and grace us with your virtue by helping us recover the books for the Confucian scholars

402
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,790
using the amazing talent in which he can memorize any books he reads once.

403
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,100
 Please grace us with your virtue. 

404
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,480
 Please grace us with your virtue. 

405
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,570
This is certainly only something His Highness can do.

406
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,370
He has all the books he read memorized.

407
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,630
Sergeant became His Highness's feet and moved the Sungkyunkwan Institute.

408
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,880
Do you approve of this?

409
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,010
They need the Crown Prince's help that badly.

410
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,590
What else can I do?

411
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,050
Tell them to go forward with it.

412
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,190
Let us go.

414
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,650
Let us go.

415
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,620
There, there.

416
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,600
That's a lot...

417
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,220
- No! 
 - He says, no.

418
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,170
Leave those books there. Follow me!

419
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,200
Put these back...

420
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,250
The wet part should go up.

421
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,760
Like this? The same way?

422
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,910
Please space them evenly. You should open them!

423
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,520
Don't just keep touching those.

424
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,930
Are these the books to be sent to Jongyunggak?

425
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,630
They need to be aired out in the sun first.

426
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,790
Hello, you came.

427
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,630
If we finish airing them out this afternoon, we can send them to Jongyunggak tomorrow.

428
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,260
- You are working hard. 
 - Not at all.

429
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,650
I am full of energy now that you have come out of the Eastern Palace.

430
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,020
Did you deliver the ribbon to your sister?

431
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,540
What are you talking about?

432
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,680
Eunuch Go was looking at women's hair ribbons on the way to Banchon.

433
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,100
So I gifted him one so he could give it to his sister.

434
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,060
I see.

435
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,120
I did not know you had a sister.

436
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,760
So did your sister like the ribbon?

437
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,020
Yes.

438
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,120
It was a pretty one. Of course, she liked it.

439
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,890
My sister asked me to thank Sergeant.

440
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,140
Thank you so much, Sir.

441
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,010
I did not know that your sister likes such a thing.

442
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,680
I saw it on the way to Banchon. So I just tried touching it.

443
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,430
But Sergeant suddenly showed up...

444
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,100
So I had to make up that excuse about a sister...

445
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,100
I made up an excuse, and he bought it for me.

446
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,510
Why are you telling me that?

447
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,490
I know.

448
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,820
You do not have to explain to me why your betrothed got you a ribbon.

449
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:35,810
Well, I thought you might think I got distracted while carrying out your order—

450
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,630
You should have told me if you wanted something like that.

451
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:45,380
Even if I did, how could I tell you about something like that, Your Highness?

452
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,430
 If you had told me, 

453
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,090
 I would have bought you ten of them or even a hundred of them. 

454
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,770
♫  A stranger who brushed against my clothes  ♫

455
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,490
Follow me from a distance. I do not want to see the sight of you.

456
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:22,600
♫  A warm ray of light already came in between 
 my doors is greeting me  ♫

457
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:31,130
♫  Just like how you can't stop the wind that rushed in  ♫

458
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,680
 I was talking in my head. In my head! You talked to yourself, too. 

459
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,100
 That is why I tried talking in my head. 

460
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,580
 It is something you cannot know about. 

461
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:46,050
Did he talk in his head again? What is something I cannot...

462
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,430
know about?

463
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:55,490
♫  I'm smiling brightly without realizing  ♫

464
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,400
♫  Quietly, in this room...  ♫

465
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,500
 Eunuch Go was looking at women's hair ribbons on the way to Banchon. 

466
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,730
 So I gifted him one so he could give it to his sister. 

467
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,970
♫  What should I do with my heart?  ♫

468
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,630
 Your Highness, this is Tae Kang. 

469
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,680
Come in.

470
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,040
   

471
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,120
Upon returning after decimating the rebels in Byeokcheon, ten years ago,

472
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,060
he gained a fortune because his uncle had died.

473
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,940
What perfect timing that was.

474
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,470
I visited his nephew in a horse stable in the West to ask about his whereabouts.

475
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,920
Park Han Soo got into gambling and has been frequenting a gambling house every day.

476
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,450
I will search that place.

477
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,910
Even if you run into him, do not approach him first.

478
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,360
Just find out about what he does every day.

479
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,530
I will meet him myself.

480
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,040
Bullseye!

481
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,390
Bullseye!

482
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,530
Bullseye!

483
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,490
I was worried because I had not been able to get my hands on the bow and arrow.

484
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,380
I guess the Heavens are helping me.

485
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,070
You are being too modest, Your Majesty.

486
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,770
The Crown Prince joined us on a nice day like this.

487
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,280
It is indeed a blessing to the educational institution.

488
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,520
 Did you test me? 

489
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,110
 So... 

490
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,910
 do you like the solution I came up with? 

491
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,180
Bullseye!

492
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,670
Bullseye!

493
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,560
Bullseye!

494
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,500
Is His Highness really memorizing all those books?

495
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,210
It is not just those books. He apparently memorized all books he looked at once.

496
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,980
We will find out if the rumors are true.

497
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,810
The Leader would not have said that for no reason.

498
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,640
What are your thoughts on seeing this in person?

499
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,840
What do you mean?

500
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:36,180
The Crown Prince. He's the perfect Crown Prince of Joseon who does not lack in any aspect.

501
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,240
The scholars of Sungkyunkwan seem to think so, and I think so, too.

502
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,090
I was curious what the Right State Minister thought.

503
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,780
Is he not impressive?

504
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,550
He got where he is on his own.

505
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,150
Let us go.

506
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,920
Yes.

507
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,330
The son got out by being clever, and the father allowed it.

508
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,210
Pardon? What are you talking about, Hyungnim?

509
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,590
Do you mean all of this was the Crown Prince's plan?

510
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,960
The King knows politics, and the Crown Prince is not ignorant about it, either.

511
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,710
How would we know what that wicked king is thinking?

512
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,210
Well...

513
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,790
By the way, was the leader of Sungkyunkwan not from our family?

514
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:46,910
Is that leader from our family? How wretched...

515
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,190
Whose son is he?

516
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,170
How did he end up teaming up with the Crown Prince?

517
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,540
All eight provinces of Joseon know that the Jo family of Seongju

518
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,820
is so powerful that they do not envy the royal family.

519
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:04,250
I am also of the Jo family of Seongju. How did you trust me

520
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,250
and express your will?

521
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,880
"The shadow cannot be bent when the body is straight.

522
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,870
How could the people be in disarray if they are cared for deeply?"

523
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:20,580
That was your answer for the entrance exam. It was very impressive.

524
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,000
How did you know that...

525
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,690
That is who you are. Your origin does not speak for you,

526
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,750
but your thoughts,

527
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,550
heart,

528
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,730
and your behavior.

529
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,320
Those are the things that speak for you.

530
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,000
I expressed my will because I had faith in you.

531
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,160
Also, I wanted to let you know that my thoughts are...

532
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,580
the same as yours.

533
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,160
I will keep your words deep in my heart

534
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,580
and keep an eye out, Your Highness.

535
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:17,190
Well...

536
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,220
You! How come you do not greet the elders of your family?

537
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,300
Elders of my family? Whom are you referring to?

538
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,480
Listen to him...

539
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,340
Do you know who I am?

540
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:35,530
I am the Minister of Justice, and he is the Right State Minister...

541
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,970
You laugh? You are also a son of the Jo family of Seongju.

542
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:42,360
How dare you not recognize us and keep your chin up?

543
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,690
Put, put your chin down!

544
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,280
How is your father doing?

545
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,460
How dare you ask how his father is doing?

546
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,240
Did you just speak down to him as you asked him that?

547
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,360
Say hello.

548
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,840
He is... Well...

549
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,560
Geez.

550
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,530
- He is our first cousin twice removed. 
 - Pardon?

551
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,140
If so, he is Grandfather's...

552
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:18,100
Yes, he is the late Grandfather's younger cousin. 
  (T/N: Addressed as "grandfather" rather than "cousin" in Korea) 

553
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,100
Oh my...

554
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,310
Long time no see, Grandfather.

555
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,850
What are you doing, Minister? Say hello.

556
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,280
Yes. I got to see my cousin's grandchildren on such a festive occasion.

557
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,400
It was nice to see you.

558
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,680
Take care...

559
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,690
How could a great family like ours produce such annoying offspring...

560
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,480
Seriously! Gosh!

561
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,430
Hyungnim! W-Wait for me!

562
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,900
This is a rare chance.

563
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,630
Four scores!

564
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,090
- What is this? 
 - What a pity!

565
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,310
- Let's do it again! 
 - Another round!

566
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,420
Let's do another round!

567
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,510
That's him over there.

568
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,700
Watch where you're going!

569
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,790
This is what's wrong with this country!

570
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:04,090
Hey! I'm glad you came!

571
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,520
I got money to pay you back.

572
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,520
I won big at the gambling house today!

573
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,280
Just wait.

574
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,340
- Where did it go? Where did my money go? 
 - Shit!

575
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,200
Just die!

576
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,860
We went through the trouble of finding all of your relatives!

577
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,220
But there was no one to get money from!

578
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,380
Geez! A bastard from a poor family got into gambling somehow!

579
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,200
- That is why your wife ran away. 
 - Geez! I said I would pay you back!

580
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,950
Why do you keep bringing up my wife?

581
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:46,060
Bastard! Give me my money!

582
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,120
Give me my money!

583
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,210
I heard the Crown Prince copied several books from his memory!

584
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,310
The rumor spread everywhere!

585
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,310
That is all because we worked hard for him.

586
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,200
Gosh, I wonder if he has any idea.

587
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,820
And how about you?

588
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,250
What did you do for His Highness?

589
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,400
I had a business to attend to. I had to do housework.

590
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,690
Housework?

591
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,920
I had to do some shoveling.

592
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,720
Who shovels for a whole month? So did you get better at shoveling at all?

593
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,380
Of course! I could easily move that mountain right now!

594
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,910
Gosh! A mountain? He improved a lot.

595
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,110
His Highness is very aware that you two worked hard.

596
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,320
He said to treat you to a meal for your help with the Royal Archery Event.

597
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,070
A free meal!

598
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:43,580
A free meal, Sir!

599
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,840
You cleaned up the place! You got rid of the tent, too.

600
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,430
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you!

601
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:01,950
Oh my! You came!

602
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,960
Hey, there you are!

603
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,180
Thank you for the meal!

604
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,730
Thank you, Friend!

605
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,510
Thank you, Sir!

606
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,840
Do you not like red bean porridge?

607
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,810
I liked the rice soup I had last time...

608
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:24,400
What? Do you not like red bean porridge?

609
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,410
I really dislike it.

610
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,520
Does it taste bad?

611
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,850
Why did they leave so much leftover? It's a precious food.

612
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,610
I guess it was not good.

613
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:37,820
You cooked those red beans all night last night.

614
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,540
I made it with the red beans I cooked all morning.

615
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,450
They did not even touch it.

616
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,100
Gosh!

617
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,490
Does the red bean porridge taste bad?

618
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,390
- That makes no sense... 
 - Not at all!

619
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,220
You said you dislike red bean porridge.

620
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,560
No, it is good.

621
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,770
Why would anyone not finish this delicious food?

622
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,250
Sounds like you took a lot of care into it.

623
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,480
It is really delicious.

624
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,100
It really is.

625
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,530
Oh, did the children come and eat?

626
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:23,210
I asked them every day, but they did not even come nearby.

627
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,270
Yes, I kept waiting because you paid us.

628
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,610
But they did not come even once.

629
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,760
Wait here a moment. I will return the money you gave us.

630
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,230
- Keep it with you. 
 - Pardon?

631
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,210
We gave them money for the girl's medicine. I guess they are getting by with that.

632
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,420
They might come if they run out of that money. So keep it with you.

633
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,720
These men, who are as handsome as flowers, are so kind, too.

634
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:53,010
If so, I will keep it safe and make sure to feed them when they come.

635
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:58,200
Goodness. Looks like you need more food! Let me get you more!

636
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,420
- Well... 
 - Yes!

637
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,040
Oh my!

638
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,430
- Help yourself! 
 - I am jealous.

639
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,500
It could last you three days.

640
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,530
Thank you.

641
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,590
Welcome.

642
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:49,310
♫  When the quiet sound of wind  ♫

643
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:56,990
♫  Approaches one step closer  ♫

644
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:03,610
♫  A stranger who brushed against my clothes  ♫

645
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,700
I will take this one.

646
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,740
How much is it?

647
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,370
It is two nyang.

648
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,340
Thank you.

649
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,900
- Thank you. 
 - Yes!

650
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,880
Thank you!

651
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,910
♫  A warm light is shining on me  ♫

652
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:35,760
♫  Just like how you can't stop the wind that rushed in  ♫

653
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,630
♫  Inside my heart...  ♫

654
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,900
Did he get it for me?

655
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,470
♫  It is roaming around  ♫

656
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,900
♫  Even a very short moment  ♫

657
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,170
 Your Highness, this is Tae Kang. 

658
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,840
- Come in. 
 - Maybe not.

659
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,900
If not, why did he put it on my wrist?

660
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:09,770
♫  Quietly, I think of you tonight again  ♫

661
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:18,450
♫  What should I do with my heart?  ♫

662
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,400
 How did Young's hair turn gray all of a sudden? 

663
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,670
 No. 

664
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:35,060
 More importantly, what does my family have to do with Byeokcheon? 

665
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:41,420
 There must be something I am forgetting from the time before my family passed away. 

666
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,310
 What made you dress like a man? 

667
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,230
 Your wedding date is approaching. 

668
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,290
 A letter of Marriage Consent came from Hanyang, so Father is writing a response. 

669
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,280
No.

670
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,660
Something more important must have happened.

671
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,200
Gosh!

672
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,930
It's raining! Goodness!

673
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,670
  
  

674
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:05,960
I think there is a hole in the sky, My Lady!

675
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,490
Where did everyone go? Why is the house so empty?

676
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:11,620
Did you not know? There was a landslide at the ancestor's burial site.

677
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,040
They all went there!

678
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,630
- A landslide? 
 - Yes!

679
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,530
 It rained a lot around then. 

680
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,920
 No, no! What does that have to do with it? 

681
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,360
 You must protect the Crown Prince! 

682
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,770
 Father! 

683
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,870
 What did Father know, exactly? 

684
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,780
 Is that why he worried about His Highness? 

685
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,590
 Why is my memory so messed up? 

686
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:42,720
 If so, something must have happened before then. 

687
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,600
 Young came to the kitchen that day and... 

688
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,700
 - Sister. 
 - Why the long face? Are you sick? 

689
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:55,030
 He just touched my hand. He definitely 

690
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,890
 did not even touch the pot that day. 

691
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,780
 So, Young did not put poison in the soup for the family. 

692
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,740
 How did the poison end up in that soup, then? 

693
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,080
 Who put the peonies in there? 

694
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,080
 This is a letter from His Highness to his teacher, the governor of Gaeseong. 

695
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,580
 The herald's face was... No. 

696
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,890
 It was definitely not him. 

697
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,890
 No! 

698
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:27,230
 That face. Please! 

699
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:31,990
 I must remember that, at least! Please! 

700
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:00,480
Master! What are you thinking about so deeply?

701
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,550
That Guardian Warrior of the Royal Bodyguard Unit.

702
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:06,730
He probably was in disguise because of His Highness's secret order.

703
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:11,330
But why did he act like he had never seen me before?

704
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,710
Did he forget about me?

705
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,860
How could he forget me anyway?

706
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,390
I am the unforgettable Myung Jin!

707
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,980
He probably wanted to pretend like he forgot.

708
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,640
I understand how he must have felt.

709
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:29,200
Your Highness! This is Soon Dol. Let me come in for a second!

710
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,370
What is this about? He is not here right now.

711
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,970
Pardon? Where did he go?

712
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:36,290
He went to the pond with the Guardian Warrior to get some fresh air—

713
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,410
Pardon?

714
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,470
No!

715
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,830
What is wrong with him?

716
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,220
It turns out his uncle lived poorly in the countryside.

717
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:52,020
He was not capable of leaving a fortune big enough to buy that large property in Mapo.

718
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:58,620
If it was not an inheritance, there must be a money trail since it is a lot of money.

719
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,520
Find out where the money came from.

720
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,320
Yes, Your Highness.

721
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

722
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,500
That is Soon Dol.

723
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,620
Do not trust him! Not him!

724
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,590
Your Highness.

725
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,270
You cannot trust this man.

726
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,500
- You bastard! 
 - Are you crazy...?

727
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:36,280
What are you doing right now? Put that sword down, immediately!

728
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,870
You must watch out for this man.

729
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:46,750
You must distance yourself from him! You must oust him!

730
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,770
The herald who came to Gaeseong... was him.

731
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:52,540
What? What are you—

732
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,490
This man is the herald who came to our house!

733
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:57,050
Are you out of your mind?

734
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:59,270
How dare you take the Royal Bodyguard's sword in front of His Highness!

735
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,390
Shut your mouth!

736
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:04,320
You were the herald of the Royal Bodyguard Unit.

737
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,010
The one who delivered the wedding gift and the letter Your Highness did not send...

738
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,360
was this man.

739
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,700
You bastard! Are you the one who killed my family, too?

740
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:21,330
Your Highness, he has the sword. Please excuse my rudeness.

741
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:34,420
Permission to strike this man?

742
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:28,980


743
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,600
   

744
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,080
 I clearly saw your face at my house in Gaeseong. 

745
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,550
 I am sure I remember it correctly. 

746
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,750
 Please believe me, Your Highness! 

747
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,370
 It is impossible. 

748
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,760
 We need to get rid of him. 

749
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,040
 Do you finally want to know what happened then? 

750
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,840
 I gained the power to fight my destiny. 

751
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,260
 Your Highness, it is not too late to oust that girl. 

752
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,830
 I will protect my people with you by my side.
