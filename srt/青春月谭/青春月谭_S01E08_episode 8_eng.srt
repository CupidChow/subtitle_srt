1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,890
   

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,540
   

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,130
   

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,560
   

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,100
   

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,400
   

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,180
   

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,780
   

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,130
You stupid idiot.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,150
You selfish bastard!

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,520
You look like a bird's nest in a full moon.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,470
Go to hell!

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:04,100


14
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,190
I was just talking to myself.

15
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,980
I did not say it to hurt anyone.

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,890
I was just so frustrated.

17
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,710
I was only talking by myself in front of an empty pond.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,240
The pond must have gotten so hurt.

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,220
What pond has ears...

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,160
I am sorry for cursing at you!

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,070
You were really upset by it, right?

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,690
Have a nice day, then.

23
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,480
Was I that harsh?

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,370
You bastard...

25
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,930
Yes. You were harsh.

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,020
How would that not be so harsh?

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,010
But I also understand how you feel.

28
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,640
You took me in as a eunuch because you believed me,

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,370
and as a result, I was able to escape the life of a runaway temporarily

30
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,850
eating kudzu roots.

31
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,200
Not only that, you were sincere with me,

32
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,010
and you shared your secret with me.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,880
 You shared with me the secret that you could not tell 

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,750
for a long time...

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,500
So you probably felt a great sense of betrayal.

36
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,320
I understand that.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
It would have hurt you.

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,780
When you read the suicide note of Shim Young,

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,520
you would have thought that everything about me was a lie

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,600
and could not have believed my innocence.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,730
You would have regretted taking in a woman who killed her family

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,970
into the Eastern Palace.

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,520
But you know what?

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,200
No trust, no foundation.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,590
Without trust, one cannot stand.

46
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,750
That is what Confucius said.

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,160
In order for a country to exist, it needs food, military, and trust.

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,330
If, for some reason, it needs to lose one, the military should be given up first.

49
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,780
The second thing to give up should be food.

50
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,720
But trust...

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,470
At least trust needs to be retained.

52
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,540
That is the only way to protect your country!

53
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,250
That is what Confucius said.

54
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,480
How could protecting one's country and people be different?

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,460
How could a person live without trust? Is that not so?

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,480
Are you trying to teach me?

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
You should explain yourself instead.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,660
You said you would not listen to anything I say.

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,630
A dead person does not talk, and how can I explain the words of a dead person?

60
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,100
However, if you are willing to listen to me now after kicking me out that night,

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,500
I do have one more thing to tell you.

62
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,380
Lose not one's closest friend.

63
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,500
A nobleman who will do great things in the future

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,280
does not lose the people closest to him.

65
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,090
Then have a nice day.

66
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,700
Everything you say is right.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,540
Since I said I would trust you, I should have trusted you.

68
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,030
Even if the words of the Royal Guard that I sent to Gaeseong were very different from yours,

69
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,220
I should not have kicked you out that night when you had no place to go.

70
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,690
As you said, my heart is smaller than a soy sauce plate.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,880
I am sorry.

72
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,010
I went to Manyeondang to tell you this.

73
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:40,140
So where are you trying to move that chair?

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,910
Then can I return to the Eastern Palace?

75
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,750
Can I return to the Eastern Palace starting tomorrow?

76
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
 Unless I burn this letter of approval to marry, 
     

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,710
 Min Jae Yi is the woman whom I need to protect. 

78
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,800
That...

79
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,000
- is not possible. 
 - Pardon?

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,120
Have I not heard all of your cursings?

81
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,350
That you would utter such unspeakable curses behind my back...

82
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,110
How could I take such a eunuch into the Eastern Palace?

83
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,460
Then could you at least open the door of the library–

84
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,110
No, I cannot do that either.

85
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,960
Were you not doing perfectly fine in Manyeondang speaking badly of me?

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,460
What do you mean you have no place to go?

87
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,090
Do not dare come anywhere near the Eastern Palace or the library.

88
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,110
Understand?

89
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,290
   

90
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,560
It is finished.

91
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,710
Is it not to your liking?

92
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,530
It is such an old makeup style.

93
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,430
I look at least ten years older...

94
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,150
Get me water to wash my face again.

95
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,030
Yes.

96
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,920
You are quite pretty.

97
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
You should redo my makeup.

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,030
Me?

99
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,540
Yes.

100
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,310
I will become my prettiest today, no matter what!

101
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,610
Well... that is not something that can happen just by making up your mind...

102
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,040
Hurry up. I told you to get me water to wash my face.

103
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,900
Yes.

104
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,660
Hey.

105
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,320
You two. Follow me.

106
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,310
Bring out the equipment and transport it to the polo field.

107
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,850
 Yes, Sir. 

108
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,420
So today is that day, I see.

109
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,080
The day that the Army and Royal Guard Unit compete once a month.

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,780
Whom did you bet on?

111
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,480
I bet on the Army. I bet five nyang!

112
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,550
Of course, you should bet on the Army.

113
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,770
The Sergeant will be flying around on his horse.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,090
This is it. It is perfect.

115
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,970
Let us get going now.

116
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,710
Where to, Your Highness?

117
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,500
Wait...

118
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,290
Wait!

119
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,040
Before the Crown Prince injured his arm,the Royal Guard had a much higher chance of winning.

120
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,360
Did His Highness play for the Royal Guard?

121
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,870
He did in the past.

122
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,050
Gosh, it was worth seeing the polo game back then.

123
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:47,970
The Sergeant and the Crown Prince used to have such fiery battles!

124
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,870
Not anymore. Now, the Army always wins.

125
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,490
It has been over a year already since the Crown Prince stopped playing.

126
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,530
Oh, it is the Sergeant!

127
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,740
Sergeant! Sergeant!

128
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,720
Sergeant!

129
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,070
By chance, was it for the Sergeant

130
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,870
that you dressed up so prettily?

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,150
We should win!

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,330
We will win today.

133
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,810
Whom did you bet on?

134
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,050
- I bet on the Army. 
 - I bet on the Royal Guard.

135
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,730
The Princess is here!

136
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,360
Today, the Army is blue, and the Royal Guard is red.

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,740
Whom did you bet on?

138
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,480
I bet on the Army.

139
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,070
Please maintain your dignity, Your Highness.

140
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,060
It is only for my dignity that I am standing still here like this.

141
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,950
If it were not for it, I would have immediately run to the Sergeant's side.

142
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,980
Do you not see my efforts?

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
   

144
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,510
Move the goalpost that way.

145
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,620
His Highness, the Crown Prince, is here.

146
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,790
   

147
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,430
Your Highness.

148
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,570
Which side will you root for?

149
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,920
- Pardon? 
 - Since you are a eunuch of the Eastern Palace,

150
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,350
will you root for the Royal Guard?

151
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,010
I am no longer a eunuch of the Eastern Palace.

152
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,060
What do you mean you are not a eunuch of the Eastern Palace?

153
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,710
I was kicked out by His Highness.

154
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,840
So I will root for the Army today.

155
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,860
I even bet three nyang on the Army.

156
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,560
Then I will help your three nyang grow threefold.

157
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,900
Why would you spend your money so wastefully?

158
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,910
How could your bet three nyang on the Army when your salary as a eunuch is not that much?

159
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,440
The Army will win, so it does not matter.

160
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,370
Are you really thinking of playing?

161
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,700
Will you be all right, Your Highness?

162
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,000
Do not worry about me. Just think about how we can win.

163
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,680
You should know

164
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,110
that I have no plans

165
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,270
to lose today.

166
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,640
   

167
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,490
   

168
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,430
Well, there should be a polo game against the Army today.

169
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,540
He probably secretly escaped.

170
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,970
- Let's get a drink later. 
 - Sounds good.

171
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,090
Soon, the door to the new world will open.

172
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,980
Now, complete god's message.

173
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,590
The death needed for a new world...

174
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,200
I will do whatever it takes...

175
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,050
to fulfill the will of the wise god.

176
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,260
Enjoy...

177
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,310
Thank you.

178
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,570
You should eat, Master.

179
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,290
How could you call me Master when I am a wanderer?

180
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,910
That is not appropriate, Young Master.

181
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,730
How could you say that?

182
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,500
You were the one who taught me the most important thing in my life.

183
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,440
If I did not meet you at the cemetery outside of the Burial Gate, 
  (T/N: A gate where corpses are carried out to be buried) 

184
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,160
I would be living as a living corpse memorizing books.

185
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,040
- Will you continue to stay in Hanyang? 
 - Gosh!

186
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,220
Have you come?

187
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,530
Are the children that we sent you a few days ago doing well?

188
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,140
They are well.

189
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,750
I am afraid that we may have caused you trouble.

190
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,300
When you leave, I will send one mal worth of rice. 
  (T/N: Unit of weight, about 8kg) 

191
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,340
Are they not at an age where they eat a lot?

192
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,500
It appears you have taken in homeless children again.

193
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,980
Then I will give you two mal worth of rice.

194
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,690
Thank you.

195
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,820
Master! You were here.

196
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,770
I waited at Manyeondang, not knowing that!

197
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,190
Master, this is the first time you are seeing him, right? He is my student.

198
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,340
Student, this is my master.

199
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,110
- Hurry and greet him. 
 - Oh, yes...

200
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,460
Oh! Were you my master's master?

201
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,310
Wait, how do you know my master?

202
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,110
I mean, I happened to meet him on the streets not too long ago.

203
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,980
I would not have imagined I would meet you again like this.

204
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,730
Fated connections are quite fascinating, are they not?

205
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,440
Yes.

206
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,230
Is the fish inside that doing well?

207
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,670
Fish?

208
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,460
Did you not know? There is a fish living inside that gourd bottle.

209
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,020
Well, so how did you two get connected?

210
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,820
Student, tell him how you came to visit me.

211
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,870
I heard stories of him throughout the land as a genius capable of figuring out

212
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,610
the cause of death from just a look at a corpse.

213
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,490
I decided that he was the master I was looking for,

214
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,430
and I will do whatever it takes to find him.

215
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,470
And so, I crossed mountains and rivers to meet him.

216
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,120
Your student, Kim Myung Jin

217
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,250
has grown up this much.

218
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,840
You are proud of me, right?

219
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,110
Yes...

220
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,380
We are supposed to practice writing today, right?

221
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,170
Prepare a brush and paper.

222
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,800
I am sure I have seen him before.

223
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,600
- Who are you talking about? 
 - The master of Master.

224
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,840
I am sure I have seen him much longer ago.

225
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,440
He goes throughout the land of Joseon like it is his home.

226
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,630
It would not be weird for you to have passed by him before.

227
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,210
- Is that it? 
 - Hurry up and take out a brush and paper.

228
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,870
Yes.

229
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,250
Come by whenever if it is not enough.

230
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,570
I am always grateful.

231
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,540
 I saw him at our house in Gaeseong! 

232
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,800
What is this...

233
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
My inkstone...

234
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,690
My mother bought me that!

235
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,630
So, where did that man go?

236
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,490
My master's master.

237
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,060
He just left. Why?

238
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,190
Gosh, where did he go in such a short time?

239
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,450
I guess...

240
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,060
all I saw was Young Master Shim Young donating to the monk.

241
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,080
How much would the monk know about Young Master Shim Young?

242
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,050
Gosh, you scared me...

243
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,010
I told you to prepare to study writing. How could you just leave like that?

244
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,130
- Do you really hate studying that much? 
 - It is not that.

245
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,680
I came out to look for your master, Master.

246
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,590
No matter how much I think about it, I think I did meet him before.

247
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,270
I had something to ask him.

248
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,590
He does not announce when he will come, so I do not know when he will come,

249
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,890
but he will definitely come back.

250
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,450
You can ask him then—

251
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,500
- Get away from me. 
 - Pardon?

252
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,760
Why are you being like that?

253
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,210
Get away from me. Get away from me, quickly!

254
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,240
Gosh, why?

255
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,580
So why did you suddenly act like that?

256
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,900
I-I guess it was not her.

257
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,310
Did you do that thinking she was the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs?

258
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,130
Did you, by chance, just try your best to look cool?

259
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:30,930
What do you mean, look cool? Myung Jin has been cool ever since birth!

260
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,230
Let us go!

261
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,630
Yes.

262
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,680
I do not think this offer of marriage is good.

263
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,050
I have a really bad feeling about it.

264
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,730
Wait, is Hyungnim participating?

265
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,830
What's this... Orabeoni is also participating?

266
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,380
Since Hyungnim is participating, the Royal Guard will probably win.

267
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,830
The Army needs to win. The Army will definitely win!

268
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,110
Gosh, I should have bet on the Royal Guard...

269
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,880
Listen up, Royal Guard!

270
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,550
We will write a new history with today's game!

271
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,870
Listen up, Army!

272
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,380
We will for sure wave the flag of victory today as well!

273
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,230
Go, Army!

274
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,160
Go, Army! Go, Army!

275
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,060
Go, Army!

276
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,270
Go, Army! Go, Army!

277
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,870
 Army! Army! Army! Army! Yeah! 

278
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,140
Your Highness!

279
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,730
 Army! Army! Army! 

280
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,000
He saw me! He finally saw me!

281
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,320
 Army! Army! Army! Army! 

282
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,730
Royal Guard! Royal Guard! Royal Guard!

283
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:55,320
 - Army! Army! Army! 
 - Royal Guard! Royal Guard! Royal Guard! 

284
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,950
 I only wish to relieve my family's resentment and return to my fiance. 

285
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,860
 - Army! Army! Army! 
 - Royal Guard! Royal Guard! Royal Guard! 

286
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,710
 Army! Army! Army! 

287
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,060
 Army! Army! Army! 

288
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,320
 Army! Army! Army! 

289
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,620
 Army! Army! Army! 

290
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,820
 Army! Army! Army! 

291
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,500
   

292
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,540
Go, Army! Fight, Army!

293
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,460
Win, Army! Yeah!

294
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,730
Win, Army!

295
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,480
Gosh, that bastard...

296
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,040
Win, Army!

297
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,220
 Army! Army! Army! Army! 

298
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,440
 Royal Guard! Royal Guard! 

299
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,200
   

300
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,760
Is it because it is his first game in a while?

301
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,160
Hyungnim is really competitive.

302
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,590
The Sergeant had never tried so hard in a polo match against the Royal Guard.

303
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,720
What is happening today...

304
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,190
Is it by chance because of me?

305
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,310
Do you think that way, too?

306
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,190
My thoughts are different, Your Highness.

307
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,500
   

308
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,590
To let you know, the score is tied.

309
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,770
Thus, both sides will compete for one final point.

310
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,570
Although you have not come out to the playing field for a year, your skills have not grown rusty at all.

311
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,140
You were also a tough foe.

312
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,600
I tried my best, and yet it was too difficult to beat you.

313
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,830
However, what would I gain from beating you?

314
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:43,160
I would like for you to remember

315
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,810
that this is my sincere heart for you.

316
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,540
Hello, Princess.

317
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,820
Sergeant.

318
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,620
You have cheered for me, but I am sorry to have disappointed you–

319
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,520
Oh! No, no. Disappointed? No way!

320
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,970
I did not know that polo games were so cool like this.

321
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,750
How could you be so bold even while riding a horse...

322
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,760
A horse is not a creature that you can maneuver around however you will.

323
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,580
And yet, you flew around on the horse as if you were one body with it, Sergeant...

324
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,930
Even when my orabeoni was on the attack, you were not pushed back,

325
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,800
but you boldly rushed toward the goalpost.

326
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,840
Seriously, it was so cool

327
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,790
that my heart almost stopped.

328
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,520
It is too bad.

329
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,910
You lost three nyang because the Army you rooted for lost.

330
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,230
I will clearly remember the cheeky things you did today.

331
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,470
I will not hold back, either.

332
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,770
Thank you, Sir.

333
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,110
I am disappointed in you.

334
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,300
You were still His Highness' man even after leaving the Eastern Palace.

335
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,670
What do you mean?

336
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,390
You cheered for the Army with your mouth, but your eyes were on His Highness.

337
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,180
Did I do that?

338
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,310
I am not sure why I did that.

339
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,090
I think I was crazy for a second.

340
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:30,230
I will keep an eye on you to see whom you cheer for in the next match.

341
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,620
How kind he is.

342
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,140
The teacher of the Manyeondang's young master?

343
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,720
Yes!

344
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,720
Are you sure you saw him in Gaeseong?

345
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,490
I only saw Young Master Shim Young offering a gourd full of rice.

346
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,550
He might not know Young Master.

347
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,370
Yes.

348
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,810
How would he know why Young did that?

349
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,430
I will still ask him if I meet him next time.

350
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,300
What if your cover gets blown?

351
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,680
We are on the run. There is even a capture-and-return order for you.

352
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,760
Since I wear a uniform these days,

353
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,170
I take a detour, so people in this neighborhood do not suspect me.

354
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,270
We have to be careful.

355
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,990
You are right, My Lady.

356
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,570
Be careful.

357
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,890
Soon Dol, go to the library and...

358
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,000
Your Highness, should I bring a book from the library?

359
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,540
No.

360
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,040
It is okay.

361
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,780
 I will root for the Army today. 

362
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,530
 I even bet three nyang on the Army. 

363
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,360
 The Army will win, so it does not matter. 

364
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,570
 You were still His Highness' man even after leaving the Eastern Palace. 

365
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,580
 You cheered for the Army with your mouth, but your eyes were on His Highness. 

366
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,700
Why does he have to be so cool?

367
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,750
   

368
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,100
You should have awakened me if you woke up. Why did you come out alone?

369
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,380
I just woke up, too.

370
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,820
- Just fill up the water jar. 
 - Water jar?

371
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,040
Is it already empty?

372
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,430
It is incense made with oil and a mix of ingredients.

373
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,420
Do you know what oil was used?

374
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,490
The scent is already almost gone.

375
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,820
Geez, try smelling carefully!

376
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,890
Oh, this is...

377
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,810
I have heard that they make incense like this in Hebei—

378
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,190
Who did you hear that from?

379
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:47,180
My father, who used to work at Royal Incense Storage, told me when he taught me.

380
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,720
But he already passed away.

381
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,490
Would you like to try more places?

382
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,420
His family is known as the incense family, who worked at Royal Incense Storage.

383
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,250
No one knows more about incense better than him in the entire Joseon.

384
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:15,050
- Stay away from me! 
 - What is this now?

385
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,100
- Stay away, stay away! 
 - What is wrong with him?

386
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,440
She must be the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs in talks of marriage with him.

387
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,030
She apparently wanted to see what kind of person he was.

388
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,360
Are you the third son of the Chief State Minister, by chance?

389
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,030
Yes, that is correct.

390
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,140
I am the third daughter of the Minister of General Affairs.

391
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,410
I know it is impolite, but I came to ask for a favor.

392
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,890
I suspected that.

393
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,670
Maiden, please be impolite as much as you want.

394
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,610
I am generous with impoliteness and rudeness.

395
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,710
That is why I do not like you.

396
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,050
When my mother told me they were discussing my marriage to the Chief State Minister's son,

397
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,970
I thought the sky was falling on me.

398
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,740
Your distinguished eldest and younger brother are already married.

399
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,700
And I already heard the rumors about the last son-

400
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,550
What do the rumors about me say anyway?

401
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,440
Oh, this?

402
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,940
Maiden, these are not human finger bones.

403
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,430
- They are from this animal called a monkey— 
 - Put it away!

404
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,630
I do not care if those are human or animal bones.

405
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,890
Even if they were wooden pieces, not bones.

406
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,500
The fact that you are the

407
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,750
least desired husband material among the Hanyang women does not change.

408
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,990
"Least desired husband material?"

409
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,240
Look, Maiden. How come you are hurting me with those cruel words?

410
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,660
I know you are the son of the Chief State Minister, but your future is obvious.

411
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,750
Of course, you will not pass the State Exam.

412
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:02,150
You will secure the lowest-ranking officer position thanks to your parents,

413
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,190
but you could never become a state councilor.

414
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,380
I do not even want to become the lowest-ranking officer, not to mention a state councilor.

415
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,500
You cannot be like that.

416
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,280
I am a woman with ambition.

417
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,750
My dream is to become a councilor's wife!

418
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,690
That is why you should end this marriage discussion.

419
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,970
I will count on you, then.

420
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,380
Hey!

421
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,310
So what if she is the daughter of the minister?

422
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,920
She cannot even recognize a good man!

423
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,790
Master, do not worry about her!

424
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,390
She is not the only woman in this world!

425
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:50,020
To me, you are the No. 1 most desired husband material!

426
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,370
I will be the first one to get in line!

427
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,110
- No! I lined up first! 
 - No, I will go first!

428
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,440
- No, I already lined up! 
 - Pick one of us then!

429
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,100
We are lining up here!

430
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,920
What? Why?

431
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,040
- Do you not like us? 
 - What is wrong with us?

432
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,010
Are you crazy?

433
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,320
Are you really out of your mind?

434
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,280
You are a man! And Eunuch Go, you are...

435
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,990
You are not even a man!

436
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,850
Just put a nail on my chest!

437
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,250
Geez!

438
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,270
His Majesty is here!

439
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,970
Lift your head up, Prisoner.

440
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,010
The ghost's letter...

441
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,310
 The ghost's letter. 

442
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,700
You are the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau,

443
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,710
who should be praying for the safety and fortune of this country and the palace.

444
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,340
But you made the country tremble in fear by killing innocent people,

445
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,910
and stirred up the country.

446
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:16,690
Do you acknowledge your crime?

447
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,490
I know that you did not do this alone!

448
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,980
Whom did you plot something so evil with,

449
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,870
and what was the purpose of doing so?

450
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,740
Is she the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau?

451
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,700
Be quiet.

452
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,790
Father and Orabeoni will be furious if they find out.

453
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,810
Open your mouth and speak now!

454
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:41,160
Will you confess after breaking your bones and throwing up blood?

455
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,900
Torture her until she

456
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,650
- comes clean! 
 - Chief State Minister.

457
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,160
You killed people.

458
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,380
Not only did you kill them, you cruelly harmed the bodies and carved characters on them.

459
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,850
Song. Ga. Myeol.

460
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,510
There must have been a character you wanted to carve

461
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,340
on the fourth victim that you failed to murder.

462
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,780
What is that character?

463
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:26,210
I asked you what you tried to achieve by carving the characters!

464
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,320
If you confess why you did something so heinous,

465
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,620
I will let you live.

466
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,090
You think I will ask you to spare my life?

467
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,490
Did you ask what the last character that I failed to carve was?

468
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,310
- Sky lanterns. 
 - Are they not sky lanterns?

469
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,750
Why are those sky lanterns so big?

470
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,230
   

471
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,800
What does it say?

472
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,520
The last character that I tried to carve

473
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,190
is the character "Oyat."

474
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,210
"Yi" as in "Oyat." 
  (T/N: It means family Yi and also plum tree) 

475
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,010
B-b-by "Oyat," does she mean a plum tree?

476
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,180
What will she do with a plum tree?

477
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,600
Song.  (Song)  Ga.  (family)  Myeol. (destruction) 

478
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,650
Yi!  (Yi family/plum tree) 

479
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,800
 The last character of the serial murders. 

480
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,490
The Song family will destroy the Yi family.

481
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,400
 It was not "The downfall of the Song family." 

482
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,160
 It was the downfall of the Yi family by the Song family. 

483
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,450
The ghost is daring to inform the palace.

484
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,220
You must honor its words!

485
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,120
"The ghost is daring to inform Yi Hwan.

486
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,230
You must honor its words."

487
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,840
 The first sentence from the ghost's letter. 

488
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,460
   

489
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,440
 I remembered that I saw dried peony leaves burning 

490
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,930
 in the kitchen when I was serving the soup for my family. 

491
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,230
 There is definitely a connection between all of these cases. 

492
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,040
 What is going on? 

493
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,760
 What is this? 

494
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,960
 My goodness, my goodness! 

495
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,220
 What is going on? 

496
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:22,280
 What is this, what is this? 

497
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,880
I have returned.

498
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,970
The Song family did not forget the unjust deaths and sorrow of the people of

499
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,150
Byeokcheon. And they are back!

500
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:39,020
I became a ghost, but my soul is already on the throne!

501
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,830
Song family will destroy the Yi family

502
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:47,090
and take this country's throne!

503
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,810
 - Byeokcheon. 
 - Byeokcheon's Song family? 

504
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,800
What did you just say?

505
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,350
Did you just say Byeokcheon's Song family?

506
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:57,690
T-T-That...

507
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,360
T-T-That wench should be ripped to death...

508
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,700
How dare you relay a ghost's message in front of His Majesty?

509
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,300
The Song family has something to say.

510
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,800
Listen up, the Yi family!

511
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,680
I will uproot all of you completely and tear you into tiny little pieces!

512
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,760
You will be left with not even a speck in entire Joseon!

513
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,510
By the Yi family, does she mean us?

514
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,300
It is not just us. Father and Orabeoni...

515
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,000
Everyone in the royal family is of the Yi family.

516
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:39,240
The curse has already started. I will make sure of it!

517
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,810
The Royal Yi family will be torn apart into little pieces

518
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:46,550
and even their souls will roam

519
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:51,040
in purgatory with no place to go!

520
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,180
Damn...

521
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,800
Your Majesty! There is no use in listening to that woman!

522
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,180
Please sentence the criminal and shut her evil mouth!

523
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,460
Your Majesty!

524
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,510
How dare you mock the royal family with your evil curse?

525
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:19,220
What would be the point of punishing you properly according to national law?

526
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:24,520
I will tear you up in pieces with my own hands right now!

527
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,470
I carved Heaven's will on my body while still alive.

528
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,970
So Heaven's will is already complete!

529
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,960
Are you okay?

530
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,280
Oh, my God!

531
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,040
Gosh!

532
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,080
Hold on, hold on!

533
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,120
Master, I will get going first!

534
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,360
Grand Prince and Princess are coming.

535
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,800
What did I tell you?

536
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,580
I said you could not handle it unless you are brave.

537
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,790
What should we do?

538
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,070
Did you hear that curse?

539
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,590
She said the Song family would destroy the Yi family.

540
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,640
She said the Song family would take the throne!

541
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,980
Your Highness!

542
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,170
That tree is a plum tree, is it not?

543
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,920
It is an plum tree!

544
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,350
It is a plum tree!

545
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,260
Call the firemen! Hurry!

546
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,680
What is going on? What is wrong?

547
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,800
The Song Family hit the plum tree with lightning!

548
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,160
There was a questioning for the head shaman.

549
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,230
The last character of the serial murders was "Yi."

550
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,530
"Song. Ga. Myeol. Yi." Song family will destroy the Yi family.

551
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:20,680
She said the Song family would take the throne!

552
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,510
She said the Song family would destroy us!

553
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,890
We are all from the Yi family!

554
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,150
J-Just like that plum tree!

555
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,970
Master!

556
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,020
Are you okay?

557
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,480
D-Do I look okay?

558
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,700
Blood!

559
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,220
I am okay. Go ahead and chase them.

560
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,640
I am so sorry!

561
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,520
Check her left arm.

562
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,610
 The reason why they took the risk by carving characters on the bodies 

563
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,420
 is the motive for these murders. 

564
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,270
The wound looks fresh.

565
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,000
It appears she carved it herself in prison at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

566
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,870
 Did she sacrifice herself to complete the curse? 

567
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,280
Does anyone know about this snake?

568
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,530
It's an amur viper.

569
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,450
It is a snake I am familiar with.

570
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:15,240
 The poison that killed the herald I sent to my master and the poisonous arrow aimed at me. 

571
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,650
 Here I face it once again. 

572
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,420
Sergeant, go to the Royal Investigation Bureau prison

573
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,970
and look into people who guarded the head shaman.

574
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:26,630
Someone must have brought her the knife and the snake.

575
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,550
Yes, Your Highness.

576
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,500
Move the body.

577
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,020
Yes, Sir!

578
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,170
 Hair that turned completely white. Peony leaves. 

579
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,010
 And the amur viper. 

580
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:47,450
 Its poison was on the arrows that were aimed at the herald and me. 

581
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,410
 The same people are behind all of these cases. 

582
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:58,690
 Min Jae Yi and I are in the trap set by the same people. 

583
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,750
Are you okay?

584
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,240
Yes.

585
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,960
How come the firemen are here?

586
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,520
What should we do? I think it is the head shaman's curse.

587
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,570
The lightning suddenly hit the plum tree.

588
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,780
The tree is burning!

589
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,370
It will not go out even with water!

590
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,210
- It really must be the Song family's curse! 
 - Shut your mouth!

591
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,560
Bring more water!

592
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,860
Go find Soon Dol.

593
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,500
Pardon?

594
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,710
Bring Go Soon Dol here.

595
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:36,580


596
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,450
   

597
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,640
 Why are you concerned with the evil murderer's words? 

598
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,550
 You mocked and disgraced the royal family! 

599
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,310
 Explain yourself properly! 

600
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:56,760
 Is it really this person? 

601
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,980
 Was he watching me? 

602
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,240
 Why would they curse the royal family? 

603
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,410
 It is the King's order? 

604
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:06,560
 We cannot miss a single moment. 

605
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,720
 I will make sure to prove your innocence! 

606
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,910
 Why did His Highness... 

607
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:15,900
 There is no greater sin a servant commits than treason.
