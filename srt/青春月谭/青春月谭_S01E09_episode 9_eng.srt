1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,490
   

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,240
   

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,040
   

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,570
   

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,550
   

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,990
   

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,050
   

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,130
   

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,310


10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,220
 How could something like this happen? 

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,610
Who told me to interrogate her personally?

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,590
How could you make me hear that evil curse from her dirty mouth?

13
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,710
It was you, Right State Minister, wasn't it?

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,280
Your Majesty, why are you concerned with the evil murderer's words?

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,560
She's just a leftover bandit.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,090
"A leftover bandit?"

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,660
Ten years ago, you arrested the bandits' leader in the Byeokcheon of the Song family.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,530
Did you not receive a meritorious deed and servants as a result?

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,190
So how could there be any remaining rebels?

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,400
Did you suppress the rebellion properly?

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,630
There is more.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,170
I see that you all are part of the Jo family of Seongju.

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,280
What are you, men, doing?

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,090
You receive meritorious deeds and get paid by the nation.

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,780
So what have you been doing?

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,660
Is your nation Joseon or your family?

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,800
I heard everyone in the Jo family of Seongju has a government post.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,420
I heard that in Bukchon, where you all live, your storehouses reek of rotting meat and fish.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,910
What did you do besides increasing your wealth and your family's power?

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,760
Tell me what you did for me, the Crown Prince, and the nation!

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,950
Your Majesty, of course, we felt terrible about this as well-

32
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,760
Right State Minister!

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,930
Do not say a word.

34
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,280
I am not in the mood to listen to anything.

35
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,140
Those who dare speak of what happened today at the interrogation

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,350
or spread the news outside the palace

37
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,340
should bear in mind that not only he

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,460
but also his family and relatives will be severely punished.

39
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,090
 We will do as you say, Your Majesty. 

40
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,960
Go find Soon Dol.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,460
Pardon?

42
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,480
Bring Go Soon Dol here.

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,730
Stop right there!

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,380
You dare attack my friend and student?

45
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,450
You are dead now!

46
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,650
It is dangerous!

47
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,850
There are two assassins. You should not chase them.

48
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,380
   

49
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,220
I need to go to His Highness.

50
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,550
She got kicked out, so why...?

51
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,820
Are you hurt anywhere?

52
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,060
Are you all right?

53
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,940
 You must have been afraid. 

54
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,400
 You must have been lonely. 

55
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,380
 Yes. I was afraid... 

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,350
 and lonely. 

57
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,630
 You must have felt hopeless because you did not know whom to fight. 

58
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,210
 You cannot fight a ghost. 

59
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,910
 They are not targeting only the Crown Prince. 

60
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,140
 They are trying to curse the royal family of Joseon 

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,590
 and shake up this nation within their grasp. 

62
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,960
 Can I return to the Eastern Palace starting tomorrow? 

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,000
 That is not possible. 

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,920
 Even though I said that, 

65
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,590
 I want you to be by my side. 

66
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,360
 I'm coming, Your Highness. 

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,460
 I will stay by your side. 

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,670
    
 How could the head shaman mention the Song family of Byeokcheon?

69
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,090
I know, right?

70
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,600
It is terrible enough that the murderer was the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau.

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,530
How did she get possessed by the spirit of the Song family, who died ten years ago?

72
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,570
What happened with the plum tree in the Grand Palace?

73
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,000
How could it suddenly be struck by lightning?

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,420
And it just so happened to be right after the head shaman's curse.

75
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,320
Did it not really seem like a ghost's curse?

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,410
Come on! How could you say something so foreboding?

77
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,050
We need to set up a special unit to reinvestigate the Byeokcheon case from ten years ago.

78
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,320
Do you mean we need to request a reinvestigation?

79
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,310
Does not what happened ten years ago bother you, Chief State Minister?

80
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,800
Since His Majesty has shown a willingness to contest the Jo family of Seongju,

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,580
would this not be an opportunity?

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,210
I do not know who is responsible for this,

83
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,220
but is it not clearly something that can weaken the power of the Jo family of Seongju?

84
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,200
All right, all right.

85
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,610
It looks like you guys are all curious about this.

86
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,930
What this means is...

87
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,560
The Song family will destroy the Yi family.

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,590
It supposedly contains such deep meaning.

89
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,190
Who is the Song family?

90
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,250
It's the leader of the bandits in the Byeokcheon of the Song family.

91
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,590
Then, who's the Yi family that the Song family will destroy?

92
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,950
Come on.

93
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,220
The King, the Crown Prince, the Grand Prince, the Princess, and the royal family

94
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,160
are all part of the Yi family.

95
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,480
Then, the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau got possessed by the spirit of Song

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,640
and committed murders to curse the royal family?

97
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Not only that, but I just heard

98
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,940
that the plum tree in the palace caught on fire.

99
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,810
What is the plum tree in Chinese characters? Plum, Yi. 
  (T/N: The chinese character means plum tree and Yi family) 

100
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,860
The ghost of Song was making a statement.

101
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,850
"I will burn you to ashes like this plum tree!"

102
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,160
There were rumors that the Crown Prince was cursed by a ghost...

103
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,820
Was that true? Gosh, why is the nation so chaotic right now?

104
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,490
- Did something happen at the Palace? 
 - Weren't you with Eunuch Go?

105
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,540
Eunuch Go already went to the Palace.

106
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,780
Things are bad! These things fell from the sky...

107
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,190
   

108
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:13,120
Out of all of these trees, how could only the plum tree be set ablaze?

109
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,270
Is there really a ghost who cursed the royal family and me

110
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,670
and struck the plum tree with lightning to make a statement?

111
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,210
There is no way.

112
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,340
A living person is behind this.

113
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,920
Your Highness, this smell is similar to the gunpowder I smelled before,

114
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,290
when soldiers were training in Gaeseong.

115
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,300
It is most likely sulfur.

116
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,840
However, it would not have burned so long with just sulfur.

117
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,630
I will visit the young master in Manyeondang tomorrow.

118
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,930
What is the matter?

119
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,020
The ones who were guarding the head shaman...

120
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,450
died overnight.

121
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,510
Lift the covers.

122
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,470
I chased the one who shot the arrow, but his accomplice appeared and attacked me...

123
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,920
so I ended up losing him.

124
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,640
How many accomplices do they have, and who is giving them the orders?

125
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,230
Did you find out about burning peonies?

126
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,330
All I heard was it may have been imported from India.

127
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,150
I heard that they sometimes apply oil to such dried flowers and burn them.

128
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,460
India...

129
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,180
Your Highness, the Sergeant is here.

130
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,040
 Have him enter. 

131
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,560
There were clear snake bite marks on their neck and shoulders.

132
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,230
Would it not be the same snake that bit the head shaman at the interrogation today?

133
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,660
This is so strange.

134
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,480
Also, in the corner of the Royal Investigation Bureau cell where the head shaman was held, a bloodied dagger was found.

135
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
It appears she engraved the character on herself with that dagger.

136
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,070
There is now no way for us to find out

137
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,240
who provided her with the dagger and the snake.

138
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,850
Are you still searching for Oh Man Shik of the department of Taoism, who defiled the celebratory message?

139
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,770
Yes. He had an older brother, but he was already dead.

140
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,720
Supposedly, his brother's wife and children live in Inchang-bang, so he often visited.

141
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,810
I stationed a soldier there,

142
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,890
so if he sends a message to his brother's wife and children, then we will be able to find his trail.

143
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,850
We must at least catch that man, since he may have something to do with this case.

144
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,980
Were you in much shock? The Grand Prince said he wanted to see the culprit of the Sabangahn case...

145
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,990
Since he has already seen it, it is too late.

146
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,440
It is not your fault, Princess. How is he?

147
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,290
He just received a lot of shock, so after he gets some rest, he should be fine

148
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,700
I will make Bojungikgi-tang for him.

149
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,830
Do so.

150
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,650
Mother.

151
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,910
Who is the Song family of Byeokcheon?

152
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you know, Noonim?

153
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,530
You should first get some rest. I'll tell you once you've gotten better-

154
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,310
Tell me now. Is Song a person?

155
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,020
Or is he really a ghost? It is scarier not to know.

156
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,790
Do you not know either, Court Lady Ahn?

157
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:42,130
Ten years ago, a group of bandits in Byeokcheon started a rebellion.

158
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,090
Song was the leader of those bandits.

159
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,950
How could a mere bandit become a ghost and curse the royal family?

160
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,170
So what happened to him?

161
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,980
The Right State Minister, who was the Minister of Defense at the time,

162
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,420
personally went and subdued them. Song also was—

163
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,670
That is enough.

164
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,770
Yes.

165
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,740
Grandfather?

166
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,900
Mother, since Grandfather subdued them,

167
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:14,340
he would subdue the ghost of Song, too, right?

168
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,340
 The Song family did not forget the unjust deaths and sorrow of the people of Byeokcheon. And they are back! 

169
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,620
 I became a ghost, but my soul is already on the throne! 

170
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,460
 The Song family will destroy the Yi family 

171
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:43,310
 and take this country's throne! 

172
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,830
- Hey, you dirty bandit bastard! 
 - He is still alive? Gosh, he is quite persistent!

173
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,270
Supposedly, he slaughtered and kidnapped

174
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,260
old men, women, and children! What more do you need to say?

175
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,740
To think that the Royal Investigation Bureau officers and the head shaman was bitten by the amur viper...

176
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,840
Read this. It is the autopsy report of Shim Young's suicide case.

177
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,960
   

178
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,340
   

179
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,050
The coroner checked the number of wounds that would have caused his death, or if any wounds led to his sudden death,

180
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,970
 but apart from the strangulation marks on his neck, there were no other wounds.  

181
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,310
 The strangulation marks were dark red, and his eyes were closed. He died with his mouth open.  

182
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,120
If someone had murdered him first and tried to set it up as a suicide by hanging, he would not display these traits.

183
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,240
It is clear that it was suicide.   Also, the handwriting on the suicide note was definitely Shim Young's. 

184
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,600
His disciples at the temple also testified to it, so there is no doubt.

185
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,470
After your family died, he supposedly kept searching your house for something.

186
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,130
Do you have any idea what that might have been?

187
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,660
   

188
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,620
   

189
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,450
But what is this supposed to mean?

190
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,060
These are the items left behind by the dead.

191
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,020
The letter containing his last words and the jade bracelet were on the wooden hallway floor.

192
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,480
Hold onto them well.

193
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,110
But how should we explain this...

194
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,780
Young had white hair? No. This is not true.

195
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,850
This would have been a sudden change. Even when I was leaving Gaeseong, Young did not have white hair.

196
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,750
Do you remember? The head shaman also had white hair.

197
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,950
How did this happen...?

198
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,910
The head shaman's prayer site is in Gaeseong...

199
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,320
In addition to the peony petals, white hair as well...

200
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,050
Also, the amur viper that killed my herald and hurt me.

201
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,430
   

202
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,540
Would they not all be part of the same group? Another thing to note.

203
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,610
 The ghost's letter. 

204
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,310
The head shaman knew about the ghost's letter.

205
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,760
   

206
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,320
Would the leftover bandits in Byeokcheon

207
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,570
be responsible for doing all of that?

208
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,270
Come! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come!

209
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,340
Let me down, let me down!

210
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,380
Hyungnim, Hyungnim!

211
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,200
T-Take a look at this!

212
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,570
w-were really alive! 
    

213
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,180
What do we do about this?

214
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,060
The head shaman, that bitch, was also one of those remaining Byeokcheon bandits!

215
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,990
When she started uttering her curses,

216
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,680
did it not feel like Song came back from Byeokcheon, Hyungnim?

217
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,270
Gosh, perhaps that bastard has come back as a ghost to slice my neck-

218
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,340
Gosh! With a scythe, Hyungnim...

219
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:27,380
It is not our family that Song is cursing, no?

220
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,720
Pardon?

221
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,150
   

222
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,430
Right! Yes. Yes, you are right!

223
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,560
You are right, Hyungnim! Song did not curse the Jo family,

224
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,740
but the Yi family! I missed that part.

225
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,470
But how come that bastard

226
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,920
is calling down curses on the royal family instead of you and me, Hyungnim?

227
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,280
Is it not only proper that one curses the person responsible for one's death?

228
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,610
Pardon? But the one who subdued that bastard was...

229
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,200
Why would I have gone to Byeokcheon to put them down if not for the king's orders?

230
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,310
You are right!

231
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,490
The reason that wretch was tied to a stake alive and executed

232
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,420
was not us but the king's orders! We are saved!

233
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,830
All of that was the will of our austere King.

234
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,800
- The Yi family, yes. 
 - Whether it is a ghost or not, what does it have to do with our family?

235
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,560
Yes, yes.

236
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,100
More importantly,

237
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,760
the King dared to spit on our family?

238
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,050
What do you think will happen as a consequence?

239
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,920
D-Do you have something in mind?

240
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,320
How could I not? A crisis is also an opportunity.

241
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,980
I am so worried that the King will reinvestigate the Byeokcheon case...

242
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,540
That will never happen. I will make sure that never happens.

243
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,320
I am more afraid of them than the King.

244
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,480
If there are remaining bandits, I will find them, and I will make sure to prevent any reinvestigation.

245
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,360
So just rest easy. You got that?

246
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,630
Yes, Hyungnim!

247
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,700
Hyungnim! Those Yi family people!

248
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,260
What do you want me to do with this?

249
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,080
We are going to do a dictation.

250
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,380
What is that?

251
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,090
You will listen to what I say and write it on the ground.

252
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,670
With this stick?

253
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,850
Yes.

254
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,330
You may speak. I will write it down.

255
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,750
You are a rude woman.

256
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,470
 A rude woman... 

257
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,630
You are a nasty woman.

258
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,590
You are delusional in assuming that I would like you when I have no interest in you.

259
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,210
What a ridiculous woman you are.

260
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,050
I am a man with my own preferences.

261
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,710
So how could you just leave after saying your piece one-sidedly

262
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,000
like a woodpecker on a tree!

263
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,060
Are you speaking to the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs?

264
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,090
I can still see the arrogant back of your head.

265
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,700
It makes me so angry that my head hurts!

266
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,230
The sophisticated daughter of a Minister? Myung Jin is not interested.

267
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,760
A woman who only has a pretty face? Myung Jin is even more not interested.

268
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,120
The one that Myung Jin is waiting for is not like you.

269
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,320
 Myung Jin is pathetic. 

270
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,820
A warm and kind woman...

271
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,680
Someone who has beautiful and special eyes to recognize Myung Jin's true worth.

272
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,520
That is the type of woman I am looking for.

273
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,700
 Myung Jin is crazy. 

274
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,840
I do not like you either! Leave, leave! Just get away from me!

275
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Did you finish writing it?

276
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,850
I was not able to write it all down because I did not study enough.

277
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,490
How come you could not say anything to her when you are so good at speaking?

278
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,780
That is a good question. Why do you think I could not?

279
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,260
Well, perhaps you were afraid of getting hit by your mother's pestle?

280
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,990
Oh, what a bright student I have!

281
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,600
How do you know my feelings so well?

282
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,070
But Master, you emoted really well just now. How do I put this...

283
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:41,180
You seemed a bit out of your mind, but you said everything you needed to say.

284
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,270
It was refreshing as if I just drank seltzer water.

285
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,180
Since this wedding is already called off, tell her

286
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,800
what you just said the next time you see her, Master.

287
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,650
You just wait...

288
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,480
The next time I meet that woodpecker of a woman, I will flatten her nose!

289
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,210
Can you really do that?

290
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,820
Yes, of course!

291
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,140
Student, we will do our dictation again.

292
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,990
Yes, Master. Just tell me what to write!

293
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,660
Myung Jin is brave. He is a truly cool guy.

294
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,150
 Myung Jin is brave. He is truly a cool guy. 

295
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,600
Look at this cute guy! Did you learn the written language already?

296
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,020
Yes, Master! When you tell me to memorize something, I just memorize it!

297
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,030
Who is your master?

298
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,000
It is you, Master. Who is your student, Master?

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,070
Obviously, it is you!

300
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,740
Oh, Friend!

301
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,090
Eunuch Go.

302
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,950
I came to discuss something with you.

303
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,280
You should come inside first.

304
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,650
There was a lightning strike, and the plum tree was set ablaze...

305
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,080
And there was a smell of sulfur...

306
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,370
But just sulfur alone would not make the fire burn so long.

307
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:15,340
If you mixed it with other things and coated the tree with it, then it could be a different story.

308
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,000
If they had perhaps mixed in saltpeter...

309
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,530
What is saltpeter?

310
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,590
It is used for making gunpowder.

311
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,520
Also, one more thing...

312
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,800
- Beeswax? 
 - Is it not used for making expensive candles?

313
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,090
If they mixed those three,

314
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,890
and then waited for a lightning strike to set it on fire...

315
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,980
then they could completely fool others

316
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,530
as if it was struck by lightning!

317
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,590
Myung Jin is amazing!

318
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:53,060
But who has easy access to those three ingredients?

319
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,600
I will need to return to the palace now.

320
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,690
Then, I shall be on my way as well.

321
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Even if this is a secret order of His Highness, this is still a job done by humans. So nothing is free.

322
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,720
How come it seems the His Highness is trying to get these services for free?

323
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,740
Geez.

324
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,080
Then, would it be all right if I returned to the palace and delivered

325
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,040
exactly what you said to His Highness, Young Master?

326
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,180
No, no. It is my master's hobby to talk to himself.

327
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,160
It is merely him talking to himself.

328
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,200
I mean, well, Myung Jin does have a habit of doing that sometimes...I mean, it is time to eat anyway...

329
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,190
I will buy you food in place of His Highness.

330
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,420
"In place of His Highness."

331
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,160
I am so grateful!

332
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,350
I knew you would be so generous, so I had everything prepared already.

333
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,580
- What do you mean? 
  - Young Master. 

334
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,800
Oh, please come in.

335
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,720
Well, I do not know if I came in at the right time...

336
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,960
You came right on time.

337
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,190
I knew that you would buy, Friend, so I asked her in advance.

338
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,540
Oh my. Oh my. Oh my.

339
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,080
Thanks for the food, Friend!

340
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,920
Thank you for the food, Scholar!

341
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,460
- Please enjoy the food. 
 - Oh, thanks!

342
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,540
It is tasty. I thought I would have to skip lunch today.

343
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,670
Wait, His Highness starves you?

344
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,850
No way.

345
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,330
There is an abundance of the best foods in the palace kitchen,

346
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,520
but I am merely a eunuch in the Eastern Palace, earning a meager income,

347
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,880
so if I miss my meal, who will make sure I eat?

348
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,370
Not only that, His Highness makes me run so many errands!

349
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,070
He tells me to go here and there and do this and that.

350
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,380
Sometimes I am so busy running errands that a bowl of water is my dinner.

351
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,680
Yet, he does not even ask whether I ate or not.

352
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,780
- What did I tell you? 
 - Geez!

353
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,290
What do you think, Friend?

354
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Since everyone flatters him as His Highness,

355
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,740
how could he know how his subordinates feel?

356
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,350
I think that His Highness has a lot of problems.

357
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,210
Have a drink with me. All right, all right, take a drink.

358
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,330
He has a lot of problems.

359
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,680
The Crown Prince went out under disguise?

360
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,330
Manyeondang...

361
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,720
For now, forget about everything else and secretly tail Go Soon Dol.

362
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,100
Find out where he is going and what he is doing

363
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,930
and who he is meeting.

364
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,820
You must not miss a single thing. Do you understand?

365
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,410
Yes.

366
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,480
Beeswax is valuable, but it can be easily found in the street markets.

367
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,880
One could obtain saltpeter from the military supplies department.

368
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,770
But sulfur...

369
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,140
We could find out if we look around the markets.

370
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,530
I will look for a person who obtained all three items around the same time.

371
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,470
How long will it take?

372
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,240
I will find out within five days.

373
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,680
Be careful. You must not get hurt.

374
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,410
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,550
You will need this. Did you not lose three nyang of your salary?

376
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,070
 I will root for the Army today. I even bet three nyang on the Army. 

377
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,720
I heard that you were participating, so I quickly switched my bet to the Royal Guard.

378
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,290
I am a woman with excellent quick judgment.

379
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,550
- Well, then... 
 - But I will also take

380
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,100
this money, seeing how you prepared it for me.

381
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,810
I like money.

382
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,000
You came a long distance. I should at least give you travel fare, Nephew.

383
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,390
This is about showing the strength of our family. I should come no matter how far it is.

384
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,380
What did you just say?

385
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,330
The Confucian scholars said what?

386
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,710
We beg your pardon as we make our supplication.

387
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,770
From long ago, thunder and lightning were understood as a sign from Heaven.

388
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,470
Thus, His Majesty should observe the heavens,

389
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,200
and figure out what the will of Heaven is so that these disasters will end.

390
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,790
The lightning that struck the plum tree must be a rebuke of heaven.

391
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,760
So we advise you humbly that it would be right for you

392
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,630
to respond to heaven and perform your role as Father of the nation.

393
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,190
From long ago, the one who rules over others should...

394
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,950
"Governor of Seongju, Jo Doo Won."

395
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,520
"Mayor of Yangju, Jo Won Young."

396
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,590
"Army General of Jeolla-do, Kim Hyeong Woon."

397
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,070
Half of them are from the Jo family of Seongju,

398
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:55,150
and the other half are either in-laws or maternal relatives of the Jo family of Seongju!

399
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,830
Is this not all...

400
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:05,110
what that prestigious Jo family of Seongju is throwing at me?

401
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,450
Fine, you bastards! How can I repent of my sins,

402
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,150
so that my virtue reaches the heavens?

403
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,160
A lightning strike is known to be a sign of the heavens being angry.

404
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Since that wrath has fallen upon the plum tree in the Grand Palace...

405
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,470
how could it not have no meaning? It is quite strange.

406
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,080
Come now! Watch what you say! Even in peaceful times of the past,

407
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,150
there were lightning strikes that took place for no reason!

408
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,990
Not only that, even if the heavens were angry, how dare they rebuke the lack of virtue in His Majesty?

409
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,520
There are so many corrupt officials in the King's court who know no shame!

410
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,830
If the heavens were really punishing the nation, would this not be a punishment against them?

411
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,130
Your Majesty, please have mercy on your people

412
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,310
who are shaking in fear due to these terrible and strange occurrences.

413
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,030
 Please have mercy on your people! 

414
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,050
Please apply Gamseon,

415
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,480
   

416
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,780
and be on probation in front of the Heavens,

417
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,720
Your Majesty.

418
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,400
Gamseon?

419
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,530
Right State Minister!

420
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,620
How truly disrespectful!

421
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,840
How dare you request His Majesty to apply Gamseon as his servant?

422
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,190
Your Majesty, this is nonsense. Please do not listen to them!

423
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,050
If I apply Gamseon...

424
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,950
If I really do Gamseon,

425
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,300
can I ask for forgiveness from the Heavens

426
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,780
and calm down the noisiness outside?

427
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,760
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

428
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,480
 Your Majesty! 

429
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,330
Gamseon? Did Uncle really request that?

430
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,560
Yes, Your Highness.

431
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,770
How cunning can these people be?

432
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,650
They use the power of their family to control His Majesty.

433
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,610
There is nothing new about that.

434
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,010
I am sure His Majesty will accept the request for Gamseon.

435
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:57,240
There is no way to fight them.

436
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,680
It is tasty. It tastes clean.

437
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,060
You have not been enjoying all those delicacies

438
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,390
solely because of your own power, Your Majesty.

439
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,580
Do you understand?

440
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,110
- Let's raise the bottoms up! 
 - Let's drink.

441
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,330
You are so impressive, Hyungnim.

442
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:20,010
Even with that incident in Byeokcheon, which almost cost your position,

443
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,620
you turned it into an opportunity to bring back Seongju Jo family.

444
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,060
You are the one who did all that.

445
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,920
Hyungnim!

446
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,130
I have always respected you.

447
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,090
I always count on you, Hyungnim!

448
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,990
You should try feeding him.

449
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,670
He is eating!

450
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,800
Tell Jo Won Bo that

451
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,470
I repented bitterly after being served with

452
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,070
this five-dishes meal!

453
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:08,420
The power he is abusing on the throne

454
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,510
was given to him by my family and me.

455
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:17,370
I am just letting him know that he should not forget that.

456
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,290
Do not worry, Your Highness.

457
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:27,150
I heard that he tossed the dining table out of anger.

458
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,930
The royal meal represents attentiveness toward the eight provinces.

459
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,650
He cannot ignore the hard work of the people.

460
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,870
I am sure His Majesty

461
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,060
learned a lot from this.

462
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,310
You cannot upset the Seongju Jo family.

463
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:43,040
Your Majesty, you had better keep that in mind.

464
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,500
Let me ask you a question.

465
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,040
- Where is the Military Supply Office? 
 - Turn to the right there.

466
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,160
Thank you.

467
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,710
   

468
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,370
I am here with the Crown Prince's order.

469
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,950
Has anyone picked up gunpowder recently?

470
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,400
Hold on just a moment.

471
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,210
- Are you sure this is the right person? 
 - That is correct.

472
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,190
I will bring this ledger to His Highness.

473
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,410
   

474
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,580
 Why did he... 

475
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,740
   

476
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,380
Thanks to your care, my mother's back pain has improved a lot.

477
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,540
Mother wants to treat you to a meal. Please make sure to stop by, Sir.

478
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,120
I am afraid her back pain will get worse.

479
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,260
Please tell her not to worry about me.

480
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,830
Thank you. Are there any other comments?

481
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,000
Eunuch Go!

482
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,510
What is this about?

483
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,440
It is nothing. Do not worry about it.

484
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,840
How could it be nothing?

485
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,480
Are you here with His Highness' order?

486
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,630
I am not.

487
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,300
I was just passing by while running an errand.

488
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,380
Yes. Yes.

489
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,590
I was just passing by.

490
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,680
Be well, Sir.

491
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,660
 His Highness would be so hurt if he saw this ledger. 

492
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,420
Did you look into the man who got the sulfur?

493
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,150
I barely managed to find this after searching pharmacies for three days.

494
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,830
Have you visited the general stores?

495
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,950
I have been doing that.

496
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,420
There are countless stores that sell beeswax in Hanyang.

497
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,700
It's true, but if you find the names of the people who purchased the sulfur and gunpowder,

498
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,620
there would be no reason to search anymore.

499
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
Do you not agree?

500
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:28,820
He was so generous. He gave me all that money and took all the beeswax I had!

501
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,400
Do you mind if I take this ledger with me?

502
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,430
By the way, whom do you work for?

503
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,710
Oh my! I did not realize you work for the Crown Prince!

504
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,810
Feel free to take it!

505
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,540
Yes.

506
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,690
   

507
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,420
My goodness!

508
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,400
Gosh! What should I do?

509
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,300
Are you okay? I am sorry. I had a lot on my mind.

510
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,340
Whatever! You should still watch where you are going!

511
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,880
It takes so long to put everything on the carrier.

512
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,970
Forget it. Just be on your way.

513
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,220
I am sorry.

514
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,170
When will I stack all this?

515
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,630
Whom did you say it was just now?

516
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,960
The one who purchased beeswax, gunpowder, and sulfur around the same time

517
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,750
was really...

518
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,860
It is definitely true.

519
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,060
I got the ledgers from all three places.

520
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,900
Open it. I will confirm with my own eyes.

521
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,220
Beeswax, gunpowder, and sulfur.

522
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,110
That means what set the plum tree on fire was not the lightening,

523
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,670
but it was really this person?

524
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,350
What brings you here all the way from Royal Investigation Bureau?

525
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,140
Do not miss a single person!

526
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,050
Mother!

527
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,710
Mother!

528
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,060
- How dare you do such a thing? 
 - I am just here because of the King's order.

529
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,200
King's order? Do you even know where you are right now?

530
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,450
Sinner Han Joong Eon, come out and receive the King's order!

531
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,380
Father.

532
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,380
For disrespecting and showing disdain for the royal family,

533
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,430
His Majesty ordered us to escort you to the Royal Investigation Bureau!

534
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,910
Did you hear me? Hurry up and arrest the sinner!

535
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,500
 Yes, Sir! 

536
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,840
Disrespecting and showing disdain for the royal family? Do explain properly!

537
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,740
Stop!

538
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,910
Let me explain.

539
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,820
Your Highness, what brings you here...

540
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,360
 - What is this about? 
 - It is nothing. Do not worry about it. 

541
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,000
 Was he watching me? 

542
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,870
Did you ask what it means to disrespect and show disdain for the royal family?

543
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,680
On the day the head shaman mentioned the curse of Song Ga Myeol Yi,

544
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,740
a plum tree in the palace burnt because of lightning, just like what the curse entailed.

545
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,370
I am sure you are aware of that.

546
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,800
A plum tree is an oyat  (Yi)  tree.

547
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:02,610
That means the head shaman's curse, in which the Song family will destroy the Yi family, is Heaven's will.

548
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,550
However, that is not the truth.

549
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:13,090
The reason the plum tree caught on fire wasn't the Heaven's will. It was done by a human.

550
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,600
He used gunpowder and sulfur to make it look like it got hit by lightning and burnt.

551
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:25,250
And he applied beeswax on the tree, so it burns unusually long.

552
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,790
Don't you think it's such a brilliant idea, Left State Minister?

553
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,410
I heard this household's servant bought beeswax for his lord.

554
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,700
Is that true?

555
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,010
No, Your Highness.

556
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,390
It was my order. I needed beeswax for something.

557
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,110
It has nothing to do with Father!

558
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,400
However, I heard it was Left State Minister who picked up gunpowder from Military Supply Office.

559
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,270
That is correct, Your Highness.

560
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,230
Not only that, you even asked the pharmacist to get you sulfur.

561
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,180
Yes.

562
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,300
That is correct, Your Highness.

563
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,830
You personally brought in gunpowder and sulfur, the ingredients for explosives.

564
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,350
Surprisingly, those things you purchased

565
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,830
were used

566
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:18,600
in a case where the royal family

567
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,350
was cursed and threatened under the name of a ghost.

568
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:29,370
What do you think of that, Left State Minister?

569
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,540
It is impossible to do that without a traitorous mind.

570
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,170
- My Lady! 
 - My Lady!

571
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,910
No, Father! How could you say the word “traitorous”?

572
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,110
There is no greater crime than treason for a subject.

573
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,350
Treason is not allowed by the Heavens, and no nation will forgive it.

574
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,020
The sinner who led treason will have his limbs torn apart

575
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,100
and his family will become servants for the royal servant's family or get sent away 2,000 li away.

576
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,600
His family deserves to be punished by being decimated.

577
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,190
That is the law of this country.

578
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,710
I believe you understand that well, Sergeant Han Seong On.

579
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,050
Your Highness, please allow me to investigate again the case.

580
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,060
I will make sure to prove my father's innocence.

581
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,670
Is what I said any different from the order you got from His Majesty?

582
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,110
All are correct, Your Highness.

583
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,480
Stop.

584
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,610
Open the door of his storage.

585
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,270
Pardon? Why is that...?

586
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,000
I will prove to you that Left State Minister and Sergeant are innocent.

587
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,160
They are fine candles with high-quality beeswax.

588
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,980
You probably needed beeswax to make these candles.

589
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,130
Wedding is a festivity for the neighborhood.

590
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,400
Looks like Left State Minister was planning a grand party for his son.

591
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,770
They are fire pockets for fireworks.

592
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,140
You must have needed sulfur for these.

593
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,580
Do we have one thing left, then?

594
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,530
Left State Minister, where did you keep the gunpowder?

595
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,790
A while back, the governor of Gaeseong asked me to get

596
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,440
gunpowder for repairing blue slates.

597
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,010
He has a pavilion his ancestors cherished

598
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,270
and it has been managed with care for generations.

599
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:54,400
But its roof had been damaged by rain, so he wanted to repair it.

600
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,770
I was originally planning to send it along Sergeant

601
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,690
on his first trip there, but...

602
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,350
Because of the death of the governor of Gaeseong,

603
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,360
it could not find its owner.

604
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,210
Did you hear that?

605
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:23,180
Has the innocence of the Left State Minister and Sergeant been proven now?

606
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,490
Yes, Your Highness.

607
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:29,210
If so, tell me now.

608
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,600
Who is the one...

609
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,660
who sent you here?

610
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,510
Your Majesty, according to your order,

611
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:43,970
I sent the officers of the Royal Investigation Bureau to Left State Minister Han Joong Eon's house.

612
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,230
Please punish them according to the law now.

613
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,930
Report what you saw to the man who sent you.

614
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,200
I will let His Majesty know that Left State Minister is innocent myself.

615
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,210
Yes, Your Highness.

616
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,010
Let us go.

617
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,950
Your Highness.

618
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,800
I thought...

619
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,100
you no longer trusted me.

620
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,690
Somebody told me this once. "No trust, no foundation."

621
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,790
 Without trust, one cannot stand. 

622
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,790
 If for some reason, it needs to lose one, the military should be given up first. 

623
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,910
 The second thing to give up should be food. 

624
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,550
 But trust... At least trust... 

625
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,270
 needs to be retained. 

626
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,970
That way, you can protect the country.

627
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:32,430
Protecting the country and protecting a person, one can not be different from the other.

628
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,790
Is the one who said that

629
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,530
Eunuch Go Soon Dol?

630
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,580
Also, you told me this other saying.

631
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,610
- "No allies, no success." 
 - A nobleman who will achieve great things

632
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:49,290
never loses the ones near him.

633
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,710
In order not to lose you,

634
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,080
I had to trust you.

635
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,130
You must have thought a lot about

636
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,670
what we could have used gunpowder,

637
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,410
beeswax, and sulfur for

638
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,400
and why we bought them

639
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,350
to keep your trust in my family and me.

640
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,560
 I definitely had the ledgers. 

641
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,160
 When were they swapped out like this? 

642
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,920
 Oh my, oh my! 

643
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,560
 What should I do? 

644
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,680
 I collided with a basket merchant leaving the store. 

645
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,700
 Someone must have swapped them, then. 

646
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,210
 Someone must have been following me. 

647
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,050
 Who do you think took it? 

648
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,670
 Left State Minister's sworn enemy, Jo Won Bo, the Prince of the Court of Seongju-gun. 

649
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,070
 If he's the one who swapped out the ledgers, he must have understood what they meant. 

650
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:59,740
 Also, if he found out what they meant, he probably did something about it. 

651
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,040
 He will not miss any chance. 

652
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,570
 He is definitely not someone who will hesitate in front of prey. 

653
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,840
 - Left State Minister and Sergeant are in danger. 
 - If so, 

654
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,200
 do you believe Left State Minister is innocent? 

655
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,210
 If Sergeant and Left State Minister are innocent, 

656
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,740
 they must have needed beeswax, gunpowder, and sulfur for a reason. 

657
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,060
 Why did they need all of them at once? 

658
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,100
 Your Highness, 

659
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,590
 - if you look inside their storage– 
 - We can find out... 

660
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,350
 why they needed them. 

661
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,340
 But Your Highness, if you opened the storage and- 

662
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,760
 If my belief was wrong? 

663
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,960
 It will end Left State Minister's political career without a doubt, 

664
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,750
 the Han family of Yeongsan will be destroyed. That means, 

665
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,550
 Jo Won Bo and the Jo family of Seongju will have eliminated their enemy, 

666
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,630
 and end up with even more power. 

667
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,380
 Your Highness. 

668
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,290
 Do you really not have enough trust in them 

669
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,680
 to open up their storage? 

670
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,630
 Just like what you told me once, 

671
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,250
 if I did not get the ghost's letter... 

672
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,280
 Your friend will turn his back against you and aim his sword at you... 

673
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,830
 When I became the Crown Prince, I decided not to have any friends. 

674
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,960
 If I did not get the ghost's letter, 

675
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,440
 I am sure that... 

676
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,620
 I would have opened up that storage solely based on 

677
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,520
 my trust in my old friend, Sergeant Han. 

678
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,700
 I will open up their storage. 

679
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,290
 I will try... 

680
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,380
 trusting Sergeant and Left State Minister. 

681
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,570
Will you...

682
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,600
be friends with me again?

683
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,010
Your Highness.

684
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,870
I...

685
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,860
never stopped being your friend.

686
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,470
I do not know why...

687
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,820
tears keep coming down.

688
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,610
It is a miracle

689
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,200
for two people to meet, rely on, and trust each other.

690
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,650
Yes.

691
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,160
That is a miracle.

692
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:24,820
I will start creating those miracles every day from now on.

693
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,620
I will have a friend, trust that friend,

694
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,150
and...

695
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,290
also, protect him.

696
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:05,130
   

697
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:17,260


698
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,060
   

699
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,720
 Will you be my friend, too? 

700
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,030
 His Highness, the foundation of the country 

701
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,300
 cannot separate public and personal matters. 

702
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,610
 You are taking advantage of the royal family's misfortune. 

703
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,180
 Why are you looking at me like that? 

704
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,560
 Make sure to keep him alive and bring him to me. 

705
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,480
 I will follow your order, Your Majesty! 

706
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,400
 All the cases are pointing toward Byeokcheon. 

707
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,390
 Come on in. 

708
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,280
 The Crown Prince cannot get involved in politics. 

709
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,780
 Your hometown is Byeokcheon, as I hear.
