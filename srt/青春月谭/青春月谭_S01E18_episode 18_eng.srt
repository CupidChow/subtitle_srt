1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,630
   

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,480
   

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,110
   

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,520
   

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,980
   

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,500
   

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,020
   

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,330
   

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,030


10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,420
 The Crown Prince has seen the ghost's letter. 

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,380
 Who entered this room? 

12
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,490
 I shot an arrow at the right shoulder of the Crown Prince. 

13
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,160
 I have fulfilled the second curse. 

14
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,150
 I have discovered a letter that the Crown Prince was going to 

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,810
 send the Governor of Gaeseong. 

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,020
 The Crown Prince dragged a fifth-degree soldier from the hunting grounds. 

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,310
 There's a new eunuch at the Eastern Palace. 

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,560
 His name is Go Soon Dol. 

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,970
 The Crown Prince is calling people from Byeokcheon to the Eastern Palace. 

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,430
 Eunuch Go of the Eastern Palace is Min Jae Yi, the daughter of Gaeseong's governor. 

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,120
 Your Highness, Sergeant is here. 

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,330
Let him in.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,620
Welcome, Sergeant.

24
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,700
Please take a seat, Sergeant.

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,760
Thank you for protecting the Princess and the Grand Prince.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,380
I called you in so I could tell you this.

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,030
The Princess is so full of worry for her younger brother.

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,110
I thought that the Princess was young, but I was wrong.

29
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,770
That she had asked you in case of an emergency...

30
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,660
If it were not for you, it would have been a catastrophe.

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,020
No. I am just glad that everyone is safe.

32
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,150
From what I heard from Court Lady Kwon, you have seen

33
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,080
the face of the masked assassin, Sergeant.

34
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,770
Is there no way we could capture that man?

35
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,230
It was dark at night, so I could not properly see his face.

36
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,620
I am sorry, Your Highness.

37
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,090
There was something strange that took place.

38
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,500
Someone has sent me an anonymous letter.

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,910
It is a common occurrence.

40
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,640
Sometimes, the court maids accuse and slander each other,

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,750
and also tell me about the rumors in the palace.

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,100
Am I not the head of the inner court?

43
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,810
I sometimes pretend not to notice,

44
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,380
while at other times, I step in to resolve matters.

45
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,520
Open it. It appears to be a prank of some court maids.

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,180
   

47
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,800
 Eunuch Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace is Min Jae Yi, the daughter of Gaeseong's governor. 

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Your Highness, this is most likely not true.

49
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,480
- It is not true. 
 - Yes, you are probably right.

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,750
There is no way the Crown Prince would have a woman enter the

51
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,390
Eastern Palace wearing a eunuch's uniform.

52
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,060
Not only that, the murderer of Gaeseong, Min Jae Yi?

53
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,420
A grave criminal who murdered her own family and a woman at that!

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,780
He would dare have her wear a eunuch's uniform

55
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,610
and bring her into the palace where the revered King resides?

56
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,590
It is not true.

57
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,320
It will most likely not be true, Your Highness.

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,490
Yes. It must not be true. It cannot be true.

59
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,710
If the Crown Prince really brought in Min Jae Yi,

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,110
he would have told you, Sergeant.

61
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,150
Is that not right?

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,390
Is not Min Jae Yi your betrothed, Sergeant?

63
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,370
This is most likely the prank of a few court maids.

64
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,010
Think about Eunuch Go's appearance.

65
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,220
If he takes off a eunuch's uniform, who would think that Eunuch Go was a man?

66
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,210
I have never seen such a pretty eunuch like Eunuch Go since I entered the palace.

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,400
Not only that,

68
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,970
does not the Crown Prince take especially good care of Eunuch Go?

69
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,650
You know that, too, right, Sergeant?

70
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,640
Thus, is that not why rumors like this are around?

71
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,600
Forget it, Sergeant.

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,750
I will do the same.

73
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,750
The reason I did not burn the letter and showed it to you

74
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,440
was because the Crown Prince trusts you the most,

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,140
and I wanted to ask you to take good care of the Crown Prince

76
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,730
so that he does not get hurt by rumors such as this.

77
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,890
Yes, Your Highness.

78
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,300
   

79
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,550
What are you doing right now! Stop right there!

80
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,610
Are you all right?

81
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,680
What is the matter? Are you Kang?

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,790
Your Highness...

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,620
I...

84
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,660
I saw his twin.

85
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,350
His twin was at the library.

86
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,780
The Guardian Warrior blocked me and let him escape.

87
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,500
He may be on the same side as them.

88
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,000
That is not true! That is not true, Your Highness!

89
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,320
It was the first time ever I met my hyungnim.

90
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,730
I did not know he was alive.

91
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,080
Choking you was my wrongdoing.

92
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,340
Because you screamed and called for others, I got so scared.

93
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,920
Your Highness.The reason I did not tell you I had a twin

94
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,320
was because my hyungnim died when I was young...

95
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,990
I definitely saw my hyungnim die!

96
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,760
But...

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,960
I was so surprised and shocked to see him alive

98
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,510
that I unintentionally...

99
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,740
Did your twin die in Byeokcheon?

100
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,730
Ten years ago, when there was an uprising in Byeokcheon,

101
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,240
I too...

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,930
 was there. 

103
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,380
 I saw the military troops kill my brother with my own eyes, 

104
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,670
and I survived alone and escaped.

105
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,150
While wandering alone like that, I met you, Your Highness.

106
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,470
Why are you telling me this only now?

107
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,510
You knew I was looking into what had happened in Byeokcheon!

108
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,100
I witnessed how people from Byeokcheon were ousted from the palace.

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,560
I was worried I would also be kicked out...

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,940
You are one of my own.

111
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,010
You thought I would not have protected you?

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,010
You were the one who brought me into the palace.

113
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:09,390
If others find out I am from Byeokcheon, that would affect you negatively.

114
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,610
Is it true that the herald who came to your house was indeed my hyungnim?

115
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:27,400
Is it also true that my hyungnim killed your parents and your orabeoni?

116
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,330
That is probably not the case.

117
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,310
Then,

118
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:44,140
is the one who spread the "Song Ga Myeol Yi" red letter cursing the royal family indeed my hyungnim?

119
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,470
The one I encountered on the streets was wearing a mask,

120
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,030
but it was definitely his face.

121
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,960
The one who shot an arrow at me a year ago,

122
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,140
and the one who slipped the snake and dagger into the cell where Head Shaman was held

123
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,960
was probably your twin brother.

124
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Your Highness.

125
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,650
How shall I pay for the sins of my hyungnim?

126
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,550
I will even give up my life.

127
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,780
Kill me, Your Highness.

128
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,970
Do you remember what happened in Byeokcheon?

129
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,140
Three months before, those events took place, I was sent off to a relative far away.

130
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,210
Because they were poor, they needed to reduce my mouth to feed.

131
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,220
However, my relative's household was also poor, so

132
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,510
I was pretty much kicked out and returned home.

133
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,170
That day...

134
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,470
I saw my hyungnim die.

135
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,650
Thus, I don't know in detail what happened in Byeokcheon.

136
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,880
I could not even find my mother's corpse.

137
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,460
I tried to forget the guilt I felt for escaping alone

138
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,910
without my dead hyungnim along with Byeokcheon.

139
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,910
I cannot believe my hyungnim is alive...

140
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,500
How could my hyungnim be such a criminal...

141
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,720
Why do you think... he came to this library?

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,770
I do not know.

143
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,190
He did not take the bracelet.

144
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,720
If he saw the bracelet,

145
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,820
he would realize that I had found out about how my family died.

146
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,260
Also, if he came by here,

147
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,880
he would have known a long time ago that I was Min Jae Yi.

148
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,410
He used the fact that he was your twin

149
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,800
and stepped in and out of the palace.

150
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,330
Thus, I cannot keep you in the palace.

151
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,240
I will give a different reason to the Royal Bodyguard Unit for you to go on sick leave.

152
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,470
- Go to your private residence. 
 - Your Highness...

153
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,880
I will stay by your side and protect you, Your Highness.

154
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,550
Please do not send me away.

155
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,240
Kang.

156
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,050
I trust you.

157
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,670
Even though you choked her,

158
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,590
I know you had no intention

159
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,920
to kill her.

160
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,860
Go to your private residence. I will call for you again soon.

161
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,030
How did I not recognize her?

162
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,470
 Are you investigating this case to protect that woman, by chance? 

163
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,540
 She is my master's daughter. 

164
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,390
 If she is innocent, I will protect her. 

165
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,170
 I am sure you will be able to save her, Your Highness. 

166
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,010
 If that woman comes back alive and proves her innocence, 

167
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,360
 I will send her to you. 

168
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
 You promised me. 

169
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,660
 That you will send her to me. 

170
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,610
 Did he keep her by his side to keep his promise to me? 

171
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,510
 - No, please let me– 
 - Stop right there. 

172
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,020
 He works for the Eastern Palace. 

173
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,000
 He is someone I trust. 

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,650
 So the only person who can touch him... 

175
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,910
 is me. 

176
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,670
 Your Highness! 

177
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,230
 We need to find His Highness. 

178
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,200
 He promised me that I would protect him, and he will protect me. 

179
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,310
 We have to be safe for each other's sake. 

180
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
    
 This round thing...

181
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,090
was here.

182
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,540
And this grass-colored one goes here.

183
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,910
This red one...

184
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,890
 The picture that His Lordship was drawing... 

185
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,740
I wonder what those red lines were...

186
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,900
What are you muttering to yourself?

187
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,970
Master, I have something to ask you.

188
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,400
What is it?

189
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,660
Is it something solemn?

190
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,550
And...

191
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,630
What do you think this is, Master?

192
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,250
Do you know what this may be?

193
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,740
By chance, have you ever seen a drawing like this before?

194
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,980
Student, this is...

195
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,660
As expected! You are a genius, Master! You are the best!

196
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,790
Is this not hopscotch?

197
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,070
Did you want to play a round with your master?

198
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,990
Do you think I am asking you because I do not know hopscotch, Master?

199
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,760
It was definitely this pattern.

200
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,520
What could this be?

201
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,560
- It is hopscotch... 
 - It is not.

202
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,590
 The Crown Prince is here. 

203
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,840
- Orabeoni, you've come. 
 - Yes.

204
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,900
I understand you are worried about the Grand Prince,

205
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
but you must also take care of yourself.

206
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,270
Your face has grown a bit lean.

207
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,270
Yes, Orabeoni.

208
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,210
 The Grand Prince's hair has not turned white. 

209
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,770
 Does the Grand Prince have nothing to do with hypnosis? 

210
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,110
Are you afraid?

211
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,850
What are you doing over there?

212
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,090
Can you not tell?

213
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,600
The moonlight is bright, so I am reading.

214
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,890
The door opens from the outside.

215
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,000
Do you think putting chairs like that will keep anyone out, you idiot?

216
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,810
I will be a reliable guard for you tonight,

217
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,430
so go inside and rest easy.

218
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,100
Is it all right if I sit here for a moment?

219
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,710
If you cannot fall asleep, you may do so.

220
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,460
Why are you at the library instead of in bed?

221
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,970
Because I needed to read something.

222
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,350
I have already told the palace workers that I will spend the night at the library.

223
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,460
You have all the books here memorized in your head,

224
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,700
so why at this hour...

225
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,720
By chance, this is very unlikely,

226
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,130
but are you here because you were worried that

227
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,200
I would be afraid due to what happened today...

228
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,820
and you came to protect me?

229
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,770
♫  At some point without my knowledge  ♫

230
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,300
Of course, probably not.

231
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,600
♫  You started blowing into my heart  ♫

232
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,630
Go inside and sleep.

233
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,210
It is late at night.

234
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:23,130
♫  Shining brightly  ♫

235
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:30,760
♫  When I look at you under the sunlight  ♫

236
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:38,190
♫  I try to carefully hide it  ♫

237
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:45,250
♫  But I end up lingering around you  ♫

238
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:53,530
♫  If I stay for one moment by your side  ♫

239
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:00,750
♫  I end up unknowingly smiling at you  ♫

240
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:12,300
♫  Quietly on this night, when I think of you again  ♫

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:21,380
♫  What do I do about my feelings for you?  ♫

242
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,600
Last time...

243
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,780
Congratulations, Left State Minister.

244
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,490
One of your family members is about to become the King's father-in-law,

245
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,310
so the power of the Han family of Yeongsan

246
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,270
looks to soar to the heavens.

247
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,490
Is that so?

248
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,990
I suppose having the Mother of the Nation come from one's family is a major honor.

249
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,090
However, how could that lead to an increase in the family's power?

250
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,670
Why would you say such a naive thing?

251
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,270
You know very well the type of power the consort kin have.

252
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,180
Is it not because you want to obtain that power

253
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,320
that you are trying to have your niece become queen?

254
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,910
Minister of Justice, what kind of nonsense is that?

255
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,380
The Left State Minister only did his duties as a subject of this nation.

256
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,620
In addition to the Forbidden Marriage Edict, the Queen Candidacy Edict was given,

257
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,750
he only offered up information on the daughters of his family.

258
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,900
Also, the Inner Court is in charge of the Queen Selection. Was this not decided at the Queen's Palace?

259
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,750
The power of the consort kin, you say. It is the duty of subjects to be faithful to the king above all else.

260
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,150
Not caring for the nation or the people,

261
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,220
being drunk with power and greed as consort kin...

262
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,430
This is what you are calling power, I see, Right State Minister.

263
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,970
Left State Minister, you are going a bit too far.

264
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,880
All right, we should stop this. We have a national celebration ahead of us.

265
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,810
Yes. Something good will happen.

266
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,410
Now, there will no longer be any talks about the power of consort kin,

267
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,440
since truly loyal subjects will serve His Majesty

268
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,940
and rule over the people instead of consort kin.

269
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,050
Let us go.

270
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,420
Hyungnim, we should go.

271
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,380
 Your Highness, congratulations! 

272
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,750
I hear that the Crown Princess who has been selected is quite wise and beautiful.

273
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,530
We are so happy that Your Highness has gained such a virtuous wife!

274
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,790
Congratulations, Your Highness.

275
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,550
 Congratulations, Your Highness. 

276
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,700
Your Highness, how do you feel about your upcoming marriage?

277
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,000
Please stop doing things like this from now on.

278
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,390
Open the door.

279
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,940
Your Highness, I will be going to the Royal Villa today

280
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,560
to be in charge of helping the Crown Princess practice the rituals for the proclamation ceremony.

281
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,320
You will have a lot of work to do. Please assist her well with everything.

282
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,880
Yes, of course.

283
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,290
Come and sit down.

284
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,780
Your Highness, I will take this incense burner to Manyeondang

285
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,170
and find out more about that wanderer monk with Young Master Myung Jin.

286
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,240
I will not send you outside of the palace alone.

287
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,060
It is dangerous, so do not go around by yourself.

288
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,230
Wherever it may be, I will go with you.

289
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,200
Yes, Your Highness.

290
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,810
Since it is before the proclamation ceremony,

291
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,800
it goes against the custom for me to enter the Royal Villa.

292
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,890
But His Majesty made a special allowance for me, and so I have come to see you like this.

293
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,950
Congratulations, Crown Princess.

294
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,550
My heart feels heavy for deceiving His Highness.

295
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,470
There is no need for you to worry about anything, Your Highness.

296
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,600
All of this was my doing.

297
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,920
Do not be afraid, Your Highness. All of this...

298
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,010
was done to set things right in politics and for the peace of the people.

299
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,280
My father always told me

300
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,620
that since we are a household of officials who govern by the blood of the people,

301
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,050
we should repay the people for their contributions

302
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:01,370
and work to provide a better life for the people.

303
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,900
I will endure this well.

304
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,970
Thank you for holding up so well.

305
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,650
Your Highness,

306
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,600
you must never offer up a sacrifice to heaven in the palace.

307
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,200
I will hold a good funeral for your mother, Your Highness.

308
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,820
Yes, Uncle.

309
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,980
I'll leave it to you.

310
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,100
   

311
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,860
I will go, too!

312
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,170
Do not say stuff like that.

313
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,060
No. I cannot bear this anymore.

314
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,940
Waiting for my husband to come home anxiously

315
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,920
after sending him off alone to some dangerous place

316
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,830
wondering how injured he would be this time while feeding the fire under the cauldron...

317
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,650
I cannot do that anymore.

318
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,460
Take me with you, please?

319
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,950
If it is really dangerous, I will come back here. Just let me go with you, please?

320
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,590
- This is yours, Dal Rae. 
 - Dal Rae's.

321
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,800
And this is yours, Meo Roo.

322
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,680
Wow...

323
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,350
What do you think?

324
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,630
It is so pretty.

325
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,950
It will be even prettier when you wear it, Dal Rae.

326
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,300
Was your mother this skilled at needlework?

327
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,470
She has truly made clothes that suit Dal Rae and Meo Roo well.

328
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,920
It is the chicken house ahjussi!

329
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,820
 Hello. 

330
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,740
Wow, your clothes are so pretty!

331
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,070
Where did you get the fabric?

332
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,240
Oh, Scholar Park gave them to me. To make My Lady's and my dress...

333
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,970
By My Lady, I mean...

334
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,220
Did Friend tell you to make clothes for you and Maiden Jae Yi?

335
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,830
Why did you not make clothes for yourself? You did not want to wear a woman's dress?

336
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,180
When you wore a woman's dress a while back,

337
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,240
 I only saw you from the rear,  but you looked pretty.

338
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,580
Master... what are you saying...

339
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,710
I know that you are Jang Ga Ram and that Eunuch Go is Maiden Min Jae Yi.

340
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,320
I will tell you one more secret. I know...

341
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,820
who Scholar Park is as well!

342
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,320
Scholar Park is also not really Scholar Park?

343
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,350
I know who Friend is...but I would rather not know.

344
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,540
You usually like to brag that you know so much when you know so little, so why would you rather not know?

345
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,590
I do not want to let Friend know that I know who he is.

346
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,660
If that happens, I would have to be subservient to him when he does not know how to use a shovel!

347
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,810
I do not want to be like that with Friend.

348
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,150
Yes. He must, always, forever be a Friend to me!

349
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,840
By chance...

350
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,600
he could not be the Crown Prince?

351
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,110
I said pretend not to know!

352
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,720
Is he really the Crown Prince?

353
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:53,490
No, he is not! You must act like he is not! If you know, you cannot act comfortably nor make fun of him!

354
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,380
But you know, my mother told me that

355
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,550
the woman who stood there in the front yard

356
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,690
loved me!

357
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,740
Gosh, it is not like that! I just did not like how that woman was mistreating you–

358
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,510
Why did you not like it?

359
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,790
By chance... is it because you loved me

360
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,930
that you did not like the woman with whom I was in marriage talks!

361
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,620
It is not like that! I told you it is not true! It is not! I keep telling you it is not true, gosh!

362
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,700
Master was from Byeokcheon?

363
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,130
I heard he spent a long time in India, but I never heard him mention Byeokcheon...

364
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,870
You should start packing your things soon and move to Naean Village.

365
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,720
Then will we soon return to our hometown?

366
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,540
That will be the case. You have been through much all this time.

367
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,460
I want to take Kang with me to Naean Village.

368
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,480
Do so.

369
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,440
How did you meet him?

370
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,940
Two years ago, I happened to see him outside the Burial Gate,

371
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,380
personally recovering the bodies of people that were thrown out.

372
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,160
I also met him at that tavern and have called him Master since then.

373
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,770
What is this?

374
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,750
This is His Lord–

375
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,950
His Lordship I used to serve...

376
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,070
I remembered what he was drawing.

377
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,970
It is not a character. It is tricky to call it a drawing, too.

378
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,260
No matter how I look, I have no idea what it is.

379
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,820
How about you, Friend? Do you know?

380
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,760
Why is it red? I have never seen him draw something like this.

381
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,700
It definitely looked like this.

382
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,690
This is a Jikgeumdo.

383
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,800
- Jikgeumdo? 
 - Jikgeumdo is...

384
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,190
What is a Jikgeumdo?

385
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,930
It is a kind of coded message.

386
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,300
You draw a border and write codes inside of it according to a rule.

387
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,100
The codes connect to each other in a complicated way.

388
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,670
Only the two people who exchange the letter can understand what it means.

389
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,630
Even if someone opens it, they will not know what it means.

390
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,050
It is a secret document.

391
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,920
He must have written a secret letter to someone.

392
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,040
He must have had a reason to share it in secret.

393
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,360
 Jae Yi, you must protect... His Highness! 

394
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,600
 Father! 

395
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,050
Something I was not aware of must have happened.

396
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,910
Why would he write a secret letter...

397
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,500
No...

398
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,430
If he really wrote a secret letter, whom could he have given it to...

399
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,990
 You are... 

400
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,840
 The judge of the Gaeseong Office! 

401
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,610
He was a judge at the Gaeseong Office but moved to

402
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,740
Hanyang since he was promoted to the commander of the Capital Military Force.

403
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,680
Governor trusted him, so he frequented his house.

404
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,130
If Governor entrusted the secret letter to someone he could trust,

405
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,240
it must have been him.

406
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,260
I need to see him!

407
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,710
Your Highness, you must go to the Capital Military Force and meet with him-

408
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,640
Your Highness!

409
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,890
You are he...

410
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,940
It is him!

411
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,130
- Sir. 
 - Are you not from the... Governor of Gaeseong's house...

412
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,980
So I was not mistaken then.

413
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,830
How come you are in the capital?

414
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,660
Did you run without becoming a government slave?

415
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,730
I came with My Lady, Sir.

416
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,600
- Well, you are– 
 - Yes, Sir.

417
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,830
I am Jae Yi.

418
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,260
How are you alive? I heard you died by falling off a cliff.

419
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,240
I managed to survive

420
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,140
and have been looking for the real culprit who killed my family in hiding.

421
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,680
Looking for the real culprit? What do you mean-

422
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,960
Sir, by chance...

423
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,040
is there a letter my father entrusted you in secret?

424
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,280
Do you still have that letter?

425
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,670
I cannot tell you anything.

426
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,210
I do not know if there was a real culprit or not.

427
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,110
You currently are a murderer who killed your whole family.

428
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,810
No, Sir! My Lady was framed.

429
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,840
It is true! Please believe us!

430
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,370
If you received a letter, please give it to me, Sir.

431
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,410
Since we share fond memories, I will pretend I did not see you.

432
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,950
Do not ever come to see me!

433
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,550
Stop right there.

434
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,190
Be sure to show proper courtesy.

435
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,090
He cannot act like that.

436
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,370
This is the Crown Prince, the foundation of this nation.

437
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,410
   

438
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,330
Y-Y-Your Highness!

439
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,490
This is the letter Governor entrusted me with.

440
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,630
It was indeed a Jikgeumdo.

441
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,440
By the way, why do you still have this letter?

442
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,540
He must have told you to deliver it to someone.

443
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,750
He told me to give it to the Left State Minister discreetly,

444
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,440
but as soon as I came to the capital since I got called by the Capital Military Force,

445
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,670
my mother passed away all of a sudden.

446
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,190
So I was busy preparing for the funeral.

447
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,410
Later, I heard the tragic news regarding Governor's family.

448
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:11,180
I was afraid I might be in danger if I delivered this letter.

449
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,570
But since it was Governor's request,

450
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,920
I did go to the Left State Minister's house to deliver the letter, but...

451
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,910
 This is the King's order! Ahn Joong Eon, the criminal, receive the rope! 

452
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,150
 I saw the Royal Investigation Bureau barging into the Left State Minister's house. 

453
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,040
I could not bring myself to deliver the letter because I was afraid.

454
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,710
I should have kept my promise to Governor. I am sorry.

455
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,530
No, Sir.

456
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,560
You kept the letter safe without discarding it, regardless of the situation.

457
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,740
I am thankful for that.

458
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,870
It is really a code. I have no idea what it says.

459
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,790
How about you, Friend...

460
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,060
Your Highness. I have no idea what it says.

461
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,500
   

462
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,030
   

463
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,160
   

464
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,070
   

465
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,810
   

466
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,640
   

467
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,980
   

468
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:54,690
 If the Jikgeumdo was addressed to the Left State Minister, he would be able to read it. 

469
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,620
 Why did Father write that? 

470
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,940
 What could have happened that I do not know about? 

471
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,430
Sergeant.

472
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,610
- Where are you headed to? 
 - I am cleaning the library today.

473
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,830
Let me carry that.

474
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:16,140
How will you carry this with your fragile arms?

475
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,680
I will carry it, Sir!

476
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,430
If Grand Prince wakes up, please give me a word.

477
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,180
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,230
Thank you, Sir.

479
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,030
- You must have suffered a lot all this time. 
 - Not at all!

480
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,680
It is my duty as a eunuch of the Eastern Palace.

481
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,040
Where do you... sleep at night?

482
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,410
His Highness got me a dwelling place for me.

483
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,100
Why do you ask me that...

484
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,810
Also, you have been speaking to me informally.

485
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,270
Why all of a sudden...

486
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,170
Thank you for being alive.

487
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:49,910
I am sorry that I did not recognize you immediately.

488
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:57,210
 If only I knew, I could have taken better care of you. 

489
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,520
I am sorry for being so inadequate.

490
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,150
Sir.

491
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,750
Without even knowing I was Min Jae Yi, you were already nice enough to me.

492
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:18,320
People mocked you for competing against a lowly eunuch for the serial murder case.

493
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:25,300
But you listened to me, a lowly eunuch by saying it is a matter of saving lives.

494
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:32,670
As Min Jae Yi and as a human being, I was treated with enough respect by you.

495
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,360
Why...

496
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,080
Why did you not come to me?

497
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,890
I am looking for the real culprit who killed my family.

498
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,690
That was more important than my immediate safety.

499
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,740
Since when...

500
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,440
did His HIghness know?

501
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,920
Did he keep you by his side, knowing you were a woman from the beginning?

502
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,070
Since the first moment I went to see him

503
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:28,070
he told me to go to you. He tried to send me away many times.

504
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:34,060
I was the one who insisted on being by his side whenever that happened.

505
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,410
Do you not know how dangerous it is for a woman to be in the palace... wearing a eunuch's uniform?

506
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,010
Not only could it endanger you, but it could also endanger His Highness.

507
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,430
It is an extremely dangerous thing to do.

508
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,540
It is not too late to take off that uniform.

509
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,820
Before the whole world finds out and things get worse,

510
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,450
you must leave the palace with me.

511
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,040
Sir.

512
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,820
Even...

513
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,800
if the day I take off the eunuch's uniform comes,

514
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:31,630
I cannot go back to being your betrothed, Min Jae Yi.

515
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,090
By chance...

516
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,080
is it Your Highness...

517
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,370
No.

518
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,950
I do not want to hear it.

519
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,840
But we...

520
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,180
already exchanged the Letter of Proposal and the Letter of Marriage Approval.

521
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,280
That means we are basically married.

522
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,670
As long as I have the Letter of Marriage Approval,

523
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,620
you are my woman.

524
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,600
You already know that

525
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,210
you cannot hold onto me with something like that.

526
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,960
Please do not wait for me anymore, Sir.

527
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,570
Please find someone new and be happy.

528
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,700
That is... everything I can give you

529
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,920
from the bottom of my heart.

530
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,450
Have you been well?

531
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,460
Is that... all you have to say to me?

532
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,120
You promised me at some point

533
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,090
that if Lady Jae Yi comes back alive and proves her innocence,

534
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,630
you would send her to me.

535
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,080
They say Dan Geum Ji Gye.*
(A friendship strong enough to cut iron)

536
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,760
It is a promise between friends.

537
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,000
I will entrust the promise we made.

538
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,370
How could I keep that promise?

539
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,400
A woman is not an object.

540
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,070
Even if you have the Letter of Marriage Approval,

541
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:35,800
how could you drag a determined woman to you and tie her up against her will?

542
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,640
If she understands the law and duty,

543
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,060
she will come to me on her own.

544
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,790
Has Grand Prince woken up yet?

545
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,510
Well, I was cleaning...

546
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:25,120
How did your visit with Grand Prince go?

547
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,290
He has not woken up yet.

548
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:32,120
I do not know if it is okay to be asleep that long.

549
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,500
Your Highness.

550
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,230
Is there another reason why you are worried about him?

551
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,800
Gray hair. Shim Young and Head Shaman had connections to peony petals

552
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
and both turned gray suddenly.

553
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,690
Do you think their gray hair is evidence of hypnosis?

554
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,860
If that dead monk...

555
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,720
hypnotized Grand Prince, his hair will turn gray soon as well.

556
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,080
For what reason did they hypnotize Grand Prince exactly?

557
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,510
Actually, Princess said to me earlier...

558
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,730
 The Grand Prince has been saying nonsense like seeing a ghost and a snake, and now 

559
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,510
 he says he gave a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon. 

560
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:23,320
Grand Prince...

561
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,210
said he gave a peach to Hyungnim himself?

562
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,610
No. It cannot be true.

563
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,720
- How could that be... 
 - Your Highness, are you worried?

564
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,580
Grand Prince's safety is on the line.

565
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,030
It is linked to the crown prince's death. How could it not be serious?

566
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:46,430
It is not just a rumor. Did he admit to it himself?

567
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,890
Did anyone else hear it other than Princess?

568
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:01,050
Apparently, the Queen was there, too.

569
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,790
Your Highness,

570
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:10,270
Court Lady Kwon could not have taken them outside without the Queen's knowledge.

571
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:16,010
Maybe Queen knew the man who used sorcery from the beginning–

572
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,190
Watch what you say.

573
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,080
So she tried to erase Grand Prince's memory using hypnosis–

574
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,290
I told you to watch what you say!

575
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,540
How dare you try to frame Her Highness the Queen?

576
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,480
Your Highness.

577
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,160
They did not kill Grand Prince.

578
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,480
The only person they tried to kill was Princess!

579
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,450
And if they wanted to, they could have easily killed Court Lady Kwon, too.

580
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:49,120
I do not know how much the Queen knows,

581
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,600
but Court Lady Kwon is from the Queen's Palace–

582
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,690
That is enough!

583
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:10,210
Your Highness, do you remember what I told you at Manyeondang?

584
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,480
 But when we are in the dark, hypotheses are also important. 

585
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,380
 If we start from hypotheses and eliminate many of them, 

586
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,010
 we can arrive at the truth. 

587
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,240
This is just another hypothesis.

588
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,300
But it is also something you cannot ignore to reach the truth.

589
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,380
Your Highness!

590
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,800
What is going on? What is all this fuss–

591
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,620
Your Highness!

592
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,210
Try this.

593
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,900
This, too.

594
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,820
None of these medicines turns your hair gray, as far as I understand.

595
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,290
Yes. That is correct, Your Highness.

596
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,510
How could I give medicine like that to Grand Prince?

597
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,810
I cannot believe he turned gray overnight.

598
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:23,290
I have never seen anything like this!

599
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,870
Did Grand Prince

600
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:42,620
really tell you that he gave a peach to Hyungnim himself?

601
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:48,480
And is it true that Her Highness the Queen was there when he said that?

602
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:22,450
- It is a lie, right? 
 - What is?

603
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,010
The redfish that lived a thousand years.

604
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:29,300
That there is a fish that lays eggs that make you go crazy if you eat them!

605
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,160
It is not a lie. That fish really exists.

606
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,780
 It lays red eggs once every 15 days. 

607
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,170
 If you eat those eggs, you go crazy. 

608
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:43,880
You are lying! What is the name of that fish?

609
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,050
Mooyyanghyeolmok.

610
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:58,870
Who is it?

611
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,540
 His Excellency, you have a guest. 

612
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,810
Who wants to see me at this hour?

613
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:22,020
Who wishes to see me at this hour?

614
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,930
Your Highness, what brings you here so late at night?

615
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,430
Coming back here after all this time feels different.

616
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:59,030
You saved me and my family, Your Highness.

617
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,720
 Open the door of his storage. 

618
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,220
 I will prove to you that Left State Minister and Sergeant are innocent. 

619
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,140
You never cease to surprise me by showing up

620
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,190
out of the blue.

621
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,160
But giving people a reason to criticize you

622
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,640
by leaving the Eastern Palace often is not good.

623
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,050
Also, you are traveling alone.

624
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,250
Is there something you wish to tell me?

625
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,470
Can I...

626
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,630
consider you as my man?

627
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,800
I have already put everything on the line

628
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,860
to serving Joseon, His Majesty,

629
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,760
and Your Highness.

630
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,050
Your Highness, this is a Jikgeumdo...

631
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,290
This Jikgeumdo is–

632
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,960
Yes. That is correct.

633
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,640
That was written by Min Ho Seung, the governor of Gaeseong,

634
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,450
who was my teacher and your friend.

635
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,580
It is a Jikgeumdo he wrote to you.

636
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,190
He sent it right before the tragic incident,

637
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:41,280
but it finally got to you because there was a situation.

638
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,030
How did this Jikgeumdo... end up in your hands?

639
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,070
First of all, we need to know what this letter says.

640
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:55,380
You must be the only one who can interpret this letter.

641
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,000
Yes, Your Highness.

642
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,120
This Jikgeumdo was written by the rule only

643
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,390
Min Ho Seung and I know.

644
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,980
Without a doubt, the tragic incident involving his family

645
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:12,280
is related to the reason why he had to send you this.

646
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,230
If so, the slaying of the family by

647
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,060
Min Ho Seung's daughter is–

648
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,590
It means Min Jae Yi was framed.

649
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,950
We need to know what the letter says.

650
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,550
The key evidence that can correct everything

651
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,830
might be in there.

652
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,060
Hyungnim.

653
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,490
Should you not get moving now?

654
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:54,570
You saw how shameless the Left State Minister was!

655
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,500
If it was not for the information Minister of General Affairs brought,

656
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,870
I almost have been threatened...

657
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,960
by his stern scolding!

658
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,610
I know. He said the consort kin did what?

659
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:10,520
How could someone whom did such a terrible thing say that?

660
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,740
He dared to lie for the selection to secure the crown princess's position.

661
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,840
I sent someone to Jangju.

662
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,750
I secured the witnesses to testify that Han Joong Seop's

663
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,240
wife is dead. Just let me know.

664
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,390
The Han family of Yeongsan is almost under our thumb.

665
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,780
The Crown Prince is a bit...

666
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,200
Your card that will destroy the Crown Prince you mentioned before...

667
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,360
Please tell us about it, too!

668
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,520
The card that will beat the Crown Prince is...

669
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,570
inside my sleeve right here.

670
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,680
What is this?

671
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,220
This is a wanted poster for the daughter of the governor of Gaeseong.

672
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,460
Is this our card to beat the Crown Prince?

673
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:18,470
I thought the Crown Prince was not so easy.

674
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,710
But he was just a puppy that was blinded by

675
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,540
some woman.

676
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,090
Some woman?

677
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,300
Take a look at this face carefully.

678
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,980
The one who looks like this is by his side.

679
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,230
 Do you remember this name? 

680
01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:00,100
 The owner of the memorial stone is a man named Song Soo Cheon 

681
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,170
 who died on June 25th, 1436. 

682
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,890
 That is the name of the man from Byeokcheon 

683
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:08,480
 who was executed in front of Sungnyemun 10 years ago. 

684
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:13,230
This is a huge deal.

685
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:18,240
Your Highness, did you already know what happened to the governor of Gaeseong

686
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,840
was related to the rebels of Byeokcheon?

687
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,560
My dagger! Where did my dagger go?

688
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,760
 The missing object is the dagger. 

689
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,690
 What did they take my dagger for? 

690
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,460
Your Highness! Soon Dol is coming in!

691
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,610
Hey, what is going on?

692
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:54,470
I am sorry. I am in a hurry.

693
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,430
 Hwan Yi No Saeng. 

694
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,820
 Dok Yi Woo Sa. 

695
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,140
 The characters in red in the ghost's letter changed. 

696
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,470
"You will grow old alone without a wife

697
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:26,480
and will die lonely without any children..." This curse means...

698
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:31,040
Soon Dol, you wretch! What in the world do you think you are doing?

699
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,150
The Crown Princess is in danger. Where is His Highness right now?

700
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,360
What are you talking about right now?

701
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,840
The Royal Villa... We need to send someone there...

702
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,580
Hair is not important at all.

703
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,890
Do not worry about it, and feel comfortable.

704
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,600
Your heart matters more than how you look.

705
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,760
Kind heart. "Hyun" as in kind.

706
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,000
 That is your name. 

707
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,790
 Your name is... 

708
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,080
 Song Hyun. 

709
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,020
What is this?

710
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,550
What nonsense is this?

711
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:30,150
What brings you here? Eunuchs are not allowed in here.

712
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,030
Your Highness...

713
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,310
Your Highness!

714
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,690
   

715
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:34,150
 Princess has been assassinated. 

716
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,710
 Your Majesty! Please dethrone the Crown Prince! 

717
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,510
 Your Highness! 

718
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,620
 Could he really be the son of the Song family? 

719
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,820
 Are you saying she is dead? 

720
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,320
 Who could have done such a thing? 

721
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,380
 Eunuch Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace is 

722
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,720
 Min Jae Yi, the daughter of Gaeseong governor. 

723
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,040
 Send someone to Royal Investigation Bureau and find out where she is. 

724
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,250
 The one I have in my heart is... 

725
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,200
 I will find you no matter what.
