1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,500
   

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,580
   

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,020
   

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,600
   

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,870
   

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
   

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,560
   

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,970
   

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,210
All right, let us all drink.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,350
   

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,690


12
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,730
Excuse me, Your Lordship.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,170
This is Ogajaebi dried yellow corvina from Yeonggwang.

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,860
Do you not have your memorial service for your great-grandfather in 14 days?

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,530
I hoped that I could help a bit.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,410
Well...

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,680
Oh, Hyungnim.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,740
I heard that you expanded your plot of land in Hwanghae-do by about 250,000 sq. feet.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,510
How tired would you be from caring for all of that land.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,290
So I prepared this for you.

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,310
Wait, that's a slave document.

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:31,280
Just as a small gift, I chose five men who are strong and good for work.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,190
Thank you for thinking about me.

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,310
I should not be empty-handed, but I came empty-handed.

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,620
A month ago– I'm not lying, I promise.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,980
I was bringing a blue-white porcelain to give to you,

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,390
when a little brat ran into me and broke it completely...

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,670
Gosh, such an expensive thing...

29
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,880
I was going to drag that lowly thing, who broke the porcelain, into the

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,900
Justice Department and give him the punishment he was due,

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,950
but just then, the Crown Prince appeared out of nowhere.

32
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,590
- The Crown Prince was out under disguise? 
 - Yes!

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,440
The duties of the Crown Prince are to stay quietly in the Palace, wait on the King and study.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,200
In front of all those lowly things, gosh...

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,850
He said that if I do not have compassion, I am not even human.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,190
Do you know how much shame I received?

37
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,020
As a result, I ended up coming empty-handed, Hyungnim...

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,700
 I will enter for a moment. 

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,900
The Crown Prince came?

40
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,470
Without any guards, with just a eunuch and the Sergeant?

41
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,200
Yes. It was definitely the Crown Prince.

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,920
The eunuch and the Sergeant fell off a cliff, so they would most likely be dead.

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,570
Well, however...

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,870
the Crown Prince was hit by an arrow...

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,280
You dared shoot an arrow at the Crown Prince?

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,470
If, by chance,

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,310
he were to capture my men alive, how would we handle the aftermath?

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,850
Did he die?

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,840
He was gravely injured.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,520
It would be difficult to come down that mountain by himself.

51
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,800
Even if he were to become a corpse there,

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,720
would anyone recognize the Crown Prince there?

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,620
It looks like we might end up catching the hawk and the phoenix while trying to catch a quail.

54
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,170
You did not leave a trace, did you?

55
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,740
Of course not, Your Lordship.

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,020
The Eastern Palace must be empty tonight.

57
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,980
It would be great if it would continue to stay empty.

58
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,190
Continuously, continuously!

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,300
Continuously.

60
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,260
Hello? Is anyone inside?

61
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,890
Please open the door! A person is dying!

62
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,160
Hello!

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,970
Please open the door!

64
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,280
Please help this man.

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,240
What is the matter at this late hour?

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,940
Please treat this man.

67
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,710
He lost a lot of blood after he was shot by an arrow.

68
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,250
I am the Sergeant.

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,180
You must save this man.

70
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,990
But I do not have the three-seven root in this apothecary.

71
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,330
My son said he would grind it to a powder, so he took it home–

72
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,170
Where is your home? I will go there.

73
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,910
Move away. This is a murder scene.

74
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,510
- Tell us what happened. 
 - Are they dead?

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,280
Why would you say that!

76
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,650
I saw them just this morning.

77
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,770
What is the matter?

78
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,710
It is terrible. They killed all three of his family members.

79
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,100
Gosh, what is happening?

80
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,470
Now we have stopped the bleeding,

81
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,370
but since the wound might re-open, he must not move.

82
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,040
- We have to move him to another location now. 
 - Pardon?

83
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,160
Those bastards also killed Oh Man Shik's family.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,790
They might be around here.

85
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,900
If they dare shoot an arrow at him, they will try to check if he's dead or alive.

86
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,040
Then they will search for the apothecary first.

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,550
Is there a place we can go to hide for the night?

88
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,940
Your Highness.

89
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,910
Do you hear my voice?

90
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,000
It is my fault.

91
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,570
You were right, Your Highness.

92
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:38,280
Did evil things not keep happening to you after I came to your side, Your Highness?

93
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,140
It is all my fault.

94
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,860
I should not have insisted on staying by your side, Your Highness.

95
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,090
Your Highness. I have something to tell you.

96
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,020
Please wake up and listen to what I have to tell you.

97
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,010
Sir...

98
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,190
What do we do...

99
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,480
His Highness... will be okay, right?

100
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,200
It is my fault.

101
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,590
This is all my fault.

102
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,970
It is not your fault.

103
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,970
Your Highness! Your Highness!

104
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,550
Are you awake?

105
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,540
Your Highness!

106
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,580
Are you okay?

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,330
Your Highness.

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,920
I am sorry that we had to bring you to such a shabby place.

109
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,880
I thought I would never see you both again.

110
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:51,560
Both of you, thank you for staying alive.

111
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,490
Me, too.

112
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,540
You do not know how glad I am that you are alive.

113
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,260
Thank you.

114
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,470
Do not cry.

115
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,530
Did the morning lectures end already?

116
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,480
His Highness did not come out, so we could not hold the morning lectures.

117
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
How come?

118
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,030
His Highness was sick with a cold, so...

119
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,460
A cold?

120
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,770
Is that the truth?

121
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,530
I am asking if His Highness is even in the Eastern Palace.

122
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,010
Start the morning assembly.

123
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,390
Your Majesty, before we start the morning assembly, I have something urgent to tell you.

124
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,280
It has to do with the Crown Prince.

125
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,450
What do you mean, "it has to do with the Crown Prince?"

126
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,450
I am sorry to say this, but not too long ago,

127
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,910
you laid down an order for the Crown Prince to be confined

128
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,320
saying that he should not get involved in politics.

129
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
This was not that long ago, and yet

130
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,360
there are rumors that he often leaves the palace.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Right State Minister!

132
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,260
Are you trying to slander the Crown Prince

133
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,560
and disturb the heart of His Majesty with mere rumors?

134
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,540
Speak.

135
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,540
M-Me?

136
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,070
Oh, well... yes. Not too long ago,

137
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,430
I did see His Highness in disguise by himself on the street.

138
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,420
Your Majesty, why do we call the Crown Prince the Foundation of the Nation?

139
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,850
It is because he is the foundation of the nation.

140
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,140
Above, he is to inherit the work of a king from the good kings of the past,

141
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,600
and below, the safety of his subjects and people are dependent on him.

142
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,400
The success or failure of the nation lies on the Foundation of the Nation.

143
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,580
But I wonder if His Highness has not forgotten his duties as the Foundation of the Nation.

144
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,360
If he were to be influenced by worldly pleasures while going to and from the Palace,

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,570
I cannot sleep at night because I am worried about the Crown Prince.

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,920
Not only that, he supposedly did not attend the morning lectures today.

147
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,590
I was told that he was sick with a cold, but is that really the truth

148
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,850
and... is His Highness really at the Eastern Palace?

149
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,060
Then, Right State Minister, what you are saying is

150
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,160
that the Crown Prince is using the excuse of having a cold and...

151
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,580
going out of the Palace nonchalantly? Is that what you are saying?

152
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,270
Your Highness the Crown Prince, His Majesty the King is here–

153
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,430
What brings you to the Eastern Palace?

154
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,270
By chance, did you come because you were worried about me having a cold?

155
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,050
It is not to the extent that you should be worried, Father.

156
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,690
I guess the three of you were also very worried about me.

157
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,260
We merely came to see you since we heard your cold was a bit severe.

158
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,400
I only said that out of my concern for the Crown Prince–

159
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,160
I do not want to hear any of it, so all of you, return.

160
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,040
Is it really a cold?

161
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,550
How is his condition?

162
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,680
The bleeding was stanched neatly, and the wound was treated well.

163
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,900
There should not be any issues as long as he recovers well.

164
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,390
Please watch to make sure he does not have a fever.

165
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,950
Yes.

166
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,520
How dare they shoot an arrow at the nation's Crown Prince...?

167
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,150
Did you find corroborative evidence?

168
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,020
The one who defiled the celebratory message at training hunt was the head of the Taoism Department, Oh Man Shik.

169
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,930
- He is from Byeokcheon– 
 - No, Father.

170
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,810
They would not be remaining bandits from Byeokcheon.

171
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,460
They tried to kill you!

172
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,760
Are you trying to protect them even when an arrow shoots you?

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,810
What have you been doing leaving the palace?

174
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,610
The ones who shot an arrow at His Highness also killed Oh Man Shik's family.

175
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,100
If they were on the same side as Oh Man Shik, they would not have killed them.

176
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,400
Do you not think the Right State Minister has something to do with this?

177
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,950
 Is His Highness really at the Eastern Palace? 

178
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:17,280
Do not assume rashly, and do not act rashly either.

179
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,070
You must take heed in everything you do.

180
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,050
You must not show any openings to those who are out to get you.

181
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,800
Stop chasing the Byeokcheon case.

182
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,430
Now is not the time to go up against the Jo family of Seongju.

183
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,080
Do you really not understand why I had you confined?

184
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,610
That was so unlike you.

185
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,570
Why did you act so brashly? Geez.

186
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,590
 How did all three of them return perfectly fine? 

187
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:09,030
Where was the place that you bumped into the Crown Prince and the eunuch the other day?

188
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,040
I-It was near Jangtong-bang.

189
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,070
What is it now?

190
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,260
Your Highness,

191
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,540
I was not able to tell you something that day because things were so chaotic.

192
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,910
While searching Oh Man Shik's house in Paju, I heard a strange story from his neighbor.

193
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,110
 He moved here about two months ago, but there was nothing weird in particular. 

194
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,970
 No, no! 

195
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,860
 I saw those guys many times at Imjinnaru. 

196
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,110
 They said they were sending stuff to their hometown, but it was a whole boatload of things! 

197
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,120
 How is that weird? It could just be that he has a large family. 

198
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,910
 That is what is weird about it! 

199
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,280
 Do you think he can provide for all those family members by running a fabric store? 

200
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,740
 Gosh. 

201
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,000
 Did you hear about where his hometown was? 

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,390
 He said it was Gaeseong. 

203
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,490
Did they really say Gaeseong?

204
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,630
Since those who hate Byeokcheon are everywhere, he was trying to hide his hometown.

205
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,560
It is possible that he was hiding it, but since he sent the stuff to Gaeseong,

206
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,720
would not his destination also be Gaeseong?

207
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,980
Did you hear what the stuff he sent was?

208
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,980
I heard it was things like fabric, rice, paper, and stockings.

209
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,600
You can easily obtain those things in Gaeseong, so why...

210
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,340
 Do you want to know what happened then now? It wreaked blood everywhere. 

211
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,900
 Because of your father's order! 

212
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,110
 None of them were bandits. All of them were... 

213
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,960
Go visit Oh Man Shik's sister-in-law, who lives in Inchang-bang.

214
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,580
That sister-in-law might know something about the Gaeseong business.

215
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,460
Yes, Your Highness.

216
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,140
I told you I want to eat a hangwa, Moon! 
  (T/N: hangwa are traditional Korean sweets) 

217
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,360
Young Master, you will get in trouble with the mistress!

218
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,110
Why are you trying to meet him? What will you do when you meet him?

219
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,500
I told you that I have something to tell him.

220
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,380
Tell me. I will deliver the message to him.

221
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,360
This is of utmost importance so I cannot speak it rashly.

222
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,350
The whole world will be turned upside down.

223
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,070
It is obvious what it is.

224
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,870
You are trying to rip off his money again.

225
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,420
What did you do with the money you got ten years ago that you keep doing this?

226
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,110
Am I the only one who received it? Even if we were all commanders,

227
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,080
you think I do not know you guys of the Jo family of Seongju got more than me because you are family?

228
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,480
- You! 
 - I heard you gain enormous money from lending money with interest.

229
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,350
But if you keep being so stingy, I have no choice.

230
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,980
Even though I wasted away all of my wealth, I still have my lips.

231
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,290
Are you not curious what words will come from my lips?

232
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,350
Please tell him that I said that.

233
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,260
Are you threatening him right now? You might really die like that.

234
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,350
Well, I am not afraid of dying.

235
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:13,250
I am pretty much a dead man as is, so please give me some money.

236
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,710
This is really the last time. Do not come visit me again.

237
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,330
Thanks.

238
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,210
Thanks!

239
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,650
♫  I cannot see anything  ♫

240
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:01,420
♫  The night I spent awake because my heart fluttered again  ♫

241
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:10,190
♫  Everything that was fancy becomes a trivial landscape  ♫

242
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,590
♫  In the end, only you shine  ♫

243
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:25,670
♫  I hope you do not become lonely and get hurt  ♫

244
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,500
♫  Do you see my heart worrying about you?  ♫

245
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:48,700
♫  I wish for you that no shadows will cast on the days remaining in your life  ♫

246
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,570
♫  Just as the sun rises from the east  ♫

247
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:03,810
♫  My heart will still be here unchanging  ♫

248
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,630
♫  Whenever you turn around,  ♫

249
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,750
Your Highness.

250
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,890
I guess I must have fallen asleep.

251
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,060
Are you all right?

252
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,610
It is a relief. Your fever seems to have gone down.

253
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,560
I will go and bring some fresh water.

254
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,850
Jae Yi.

255
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,930
How did you know that I would

256
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,600
wait for you in the east?

257
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,380
I know...

258
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,120
I think...

259
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,700
I can find where you are now, whenever and wherever.

260
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,780
I also...

261
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,040
know where I should...

262
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,270
wait for you now.

263
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,500
Are you... are you hurt anywhere?

264
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,490
No. Fortunately, I am fine.

265
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,680
 Your Highness! Your Highness... 

266
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,510
Why would a man act like that,

267
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,460
even if he was worried about His Highness...?

268
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,040
 Jae Yi. 

269
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,470
He called my name.

270
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,610
 Jae Yi. 

271
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,750
He called... my name.

272
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,440
How dare you! Let go!

273
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,170
Mother! Why are you being like this, Mother?

274
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,670
- Let go! 
 - Father, you are up!

275
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,440
You wretch! Stop right there!

276
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,560
Why are you trying to beat me with that broom without telling me the reason?

277
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,440
You bastard! Stop right there!

278
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,200
- Whoa, whoa! 
 - You bastard! What are you doing with that?

279
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,570
Mother, you know what this is, right?

280
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,590
- Let go of that! 
 - Oh, okay, I will let go.

281
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,050
Whoa!

282
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,170
- Son? 
 - What is the matter?

283
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,660
You should let go of that while I'm telling you nicely.

284
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,770
Then, Mother, you will let go of that as well, right?

285
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,750
Of course.

286
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,370
Then I will put it down.

287
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,570
It is going down, down, down.

288
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,850
You should put that down, too.

289
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,690
- You should put it down. 
 - Yeah, okay.

290
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,710
- Whoa, whoa. 
 - Hurry, put it down.

291
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,070
You bastard!

292
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,830
Gosh, Ladyship! It looks like you are in big trouble!

293
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,250
This precious starting soy sauce was passed down from grandmother's grandmother...

294
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,920
Gosh, such a waste...

295
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,760
Everything is going wrong because of you!

296
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,870
Would you even go so far as play around with a girl?

297
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,510
Pardon? Play around with a girl?

298
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,810
You do not know the girl who went to the daughter of the Minister, asking her to give up on the marriage?

299
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,500
She supposedly said she loves you.

300
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,420
Pardon? Did she say she loved me?

301
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,710
Gosh, I had a girl who loved me.

302
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,890
How could you act like you do not know?

303
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,630
That girl must have had a reason.

304
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,170
She must have acted so brashly because she had support.

305
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,790
You wretched bastard!

306
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,490
- Excuse me... 
 - Gosh...

307
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,860
Oh my! Welcome.

308
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,400
Well, you sold a bracelet to the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs, right?

309
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,150
What about that bracelet?

310
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,670
Why would you ask that? Are you worried it could be a used item?

311
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,000
That was new!

312
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,470
I did not come to ask if it was new or not.

313
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,860
I was just curious about where you got that bracelet.

314
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,500
What would you do if I told you? Will you go to the government office and complain?

315
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,170
No! It just looked a lot like a bracelet I'd seen before,

316
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,900
so that is why I am asking.

317
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,080
Do not worry about anything like that.

318
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,490
I bought that from the street vendor as well.

319
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,710
The street vendor?

320
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,450
They wander throughout the land of Joseon as if it was their home.

321
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,600
It looked like an item that came from a prestigious family.

322
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,130
It must have been brought over by merchants who crossed the seas.

323
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,410
Whoa, whoa. Stop this and go away.

324
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,030
Stop interfering with my business and go away.

325
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,290
 How did My Lady's bracelet end up all the way here? 

326
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,290
No matter how long we watch her, I do not think she is meeting Min Jae Yi.

327
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,110
Let us just hand her over to the Gaeseong government and be done with it.

328
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,350
Just wait.

329
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,110
How could we hand her over to the Gaeseong government without any negotiations?

330
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,610
Oh, it is the student.

331
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,800
Gosh, you are carrying such heavy things!

332
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,590
- Thank you. 
 - Where are you going?

333
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,710
I'm taking this to the courtesan house and bringing some more work back.

334
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,170
I will give you half of it again, so give it to your mother.

335
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,290
Really? My mother is really good at sewing, right?

336
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,710
I will carry it to the courtesan house for you.

337
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,450
Gosh, I would be grateful if you would do that!

338
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,110
You stayed up all night to do these?

339
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,650
Things have gotten easier for me because of your mother.

340
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,730
It is pretty. Right?

341
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,440
Here. I leave these up to you again.

342
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,550
Yes, I will do my best to finish them as soon as possible.

343
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,770
Here. I put in a generous amount.

344
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,980
Oh, thank you!

345
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,010
Oh, just leave it to us!

346
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,710
How dare you, a girl from Byeokcheon, set foot here?

347
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,830
Did you think I would not know you were a Byeokcheon girl if you did not mention it?

348
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,970
So what if you worked as an inner court maid at the palace?

349
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,300
You were kicked out, which means you are a Byeokcheon girl!

350
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,830
- What does my hometown have to do with anything? 
 - Gosh, so annoying.

351
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,300
I just have to be good at sewing to get some sewing work, no?

352
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,350
You have not even looked at the embroidery that I have done...

353
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,730
What are you doing not sending her away?

354
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,510
Yes, Ma'am.

355
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,070
Such a persistent girl.

356
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,160
She keeps coming back after being chased out many times.

357
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,230
It is because she has nowhere to go.

358
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,950
Who would give work to someone from Byeokcheon?

359
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,310
Look!

360
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,450
- Where do you live? 
 - Why do you ask where I live?

361
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,070
Since I receive work from this house, receive sewing work from me.

362
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,840
If you tell me where you live, I will come to pick this up

363
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,370
around the time you are finished sewing.

364
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,950
Come to Namsan Village and ask for Gap Seok's place.

365
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,970
But why would you entrust me with these expensive dresses?

366
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,160
If you worked in the palace, you must have made clothes for the King.

367
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,570
How sad.

368
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,040
I cannot believe they would not give you work because you are from Byeokcheon despite your skill.

369
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,740
Because I got kicked out of the Palace and had to stay with my orabeoni,

370
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,110
people found out that he was also from Byeokcheon and

371
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,360
and also got kicked out of the field he was tenant farming for ten years..

372
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,080
The world is quite malicious.

373
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,710
I will do this job well and give it back to you.

374
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,080
Thank you for trusting me.

375
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,410
Never mind the phoenix. We did not even catch the quail and the hawk.

376
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,420
I thought we would get rid of those two from the Crown Prince's side.

377
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,730
It would have been good if we had managed to get rid of that eunuch, at least...

378
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,220
Who is this!

379
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,100
Let go! Who is responsible for this?

380
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,930
Let go!

381
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,840
Put me down! Gosh, put me down!

382
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,870
Who are you?

383
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,290
How could you do this to a eunuch of the Eastern Palace?

384
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,830
 Permission to strike this man? 

385
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,010
What are you? Who ordered you to do this?

386
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,300
Shut up! Your life is in our hands.

387
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,330
If you want to live, answer our questions without making a fuss!

388
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,580
What do you want?

389
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,390
Tell us everything you know about the Crown Prince.

390
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,260
What did you say?

391
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,950
What do you mean, Soon Dol was dragged away?

392
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,070
What are you plotting by His Highness' side?

393
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,530
Did the Guardian Warrior command you to get rid of me?

394
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,850
Stop talking nonsense! Quickly tell us about the Crown Prince!

395
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,190
Do you not understand your life is ticking away?

396
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,480
Do I look like I am in my right mind right now?

397
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,900
You bastard!

398
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
S-Spare me!

399
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,020
Gosh, I am going to die!

400
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,740
What are you doing?

401
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,440
P-Put that dagger away. It is dangerous.

402
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,790
M-My stomach hurts so much...

403
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,260
W-We should resolve this with words.

404
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,100
Loyalty test?

405
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,750
What will you do by testing Soon Dol's loyalty?

406
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,790
If anyone, it should be me.

407
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,790
Since he is the first new eunuch in a while, they have been waiting to do this for a while.

408
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,900
Why are you so angry about this?

409
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,420
We have always done this as a custom of the Eunuch Bureau...

410
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,540
If something is a custom, does that make it right?

411
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,640
Even though an old sage says we should know both what is old and what is new,

412
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,660
some customs may be unnecessary.

413
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,740
Thus, it is unwise to carry them out without thought.

414
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,270
It is over here, Your Highness.

415
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,890
Gosh!

416
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,050
Let us live!

417
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,770
Goodness!

418
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,620
Goodness! Your Highness!

419
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,680
We did not get to test his loyalty because he fought us with all his might.

420
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,150
You got attacked without finding out anything.

421
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,350
That means he passed.

422
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,530
Go Soon Dol passed the loyalty test!

423
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,030
By the way, Your Highness, he possessed a knife!

424
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,670
A eunuch who serves Your Highness possesses a knife?

425
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,140
How did that happen? Let me see.

426
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,800
You little bastard.

427
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,880
Just leave it.

428
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,210
I gave him that knife.

429
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,080
I gave it to him because he sometimes needs it to guard me.

430
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,250
I will go to the library. Follow me, Soon Dol.

431
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,080
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,160
We were not going to kill Soon Dol. Why did he come here even though he was sick?

433
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,000
This is a huge discrimination! I hate discrimination more than anything!

434
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,420
Right, he said something strange!

435
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,820
He asked me if Guardian Warrior had told me to kill him.

436
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,850
Guardian Warrior?

437
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:38,510
 Go Soon Dol is wary of Guardian Warrior and carries a dagger. 

438
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,790
Lift up your head.

439
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,380
Did you only injure your face?

440
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,700
It is nothing.

441
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,280
Do you know how much I worried that you might get hurt?

442
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,710
Why are you smiling?

443
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,550
Well... I just...

444
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,910
Why did I smile?

445
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe I was glad you worried about me?

446
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,770
I should...

447
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,680
send you away.

448
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,830
Go to Sergeant, your betrothed.

449
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,400
You have been through a lot.

450
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,380
 Could it be... 

451
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,100
 Jae Yi? 

452
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,120
 Min Jae Yi. 

453
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,770
On, you came.

454
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,900
Your cousin came all the way from Jangju.

455
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,370
You must be surprised because I never told you.

456
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,970
Come and have a seat here!

457
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,820
I should prepare So Eun's room myself.

458
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,610
Sergeant is waiting for you, his betrothed, and is looking for you desperately.

459
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:05,690
He will hear your plea for innocence and believe you, so...

460
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,670
you should... go back to where you belong.

461
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,390
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

462
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,520
Did I do anything wrong?

463
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,670
Why are you trying to kick me out?

464
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,830
I am not trying to kick you out. You got hurt so much by being with me.

465
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,480
I cannot stand to see you in danger anymore.

466
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,970
I will talk to Sergeant and he will find you a place to stay.

467
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,300
You should go back to where you belong.

468
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,950
Do you...

469
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,780
really want me to do that?

470
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,380
If you go to Sergeant, I will clear your name for you.

471
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,330
Would you be okay even if I leave you?

472
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,800
Would you really be okay even if I marry

473
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,220
Sergeant?

474
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,810
You should not have

475
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,940
come to me at all.

476
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,550
I never regretted it.

477
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,280
Even if I could go back in time,

478
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,000
I still would have come to you.

479
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,060
It was the only decision I made as a woman

480
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,980
that I would... never regret.

481
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,550
I am telling you to leave for your own good. Also...

482
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,920
it is the right thing to do for Sergeant as well.

483
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,910
- So...
 - Did you... not want me...

484
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,960
around that much?

485
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,210
I... will not go to Sergeant.

486
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,790
We are finally getting close to finding out their identity.

487
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,430
I cannot give up now.

488
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,980
I will continue to investigate by your side.

489
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,500
If I were in danger, you would be in danger, too.

490
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,130
How could I leave you alone in danger just so I could be safe?

491
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,130
How could you only say things that hurt me?

492
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,940
No matter what you say, I will not go. I mean...

493
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,050
I cannot go.

494
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,600
And...

495
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,860
I...

496
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,240
I...

497
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,100
am not in the condition to go to Sergeant anyway.

498
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,310
What do you mean, you are not in the condition?

499
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,880
I...

500
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,260
am in love with someone else.

501
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,440
What are you talking about–

502
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,030
I have someone I secretly love.

503
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,480
That is why I cannot go to him.

504
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,200
Well... Do you love someone?

505
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,080
Secretly in love? Did you meet another man dressed as a eunuch? Well–

506
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,930
Look at you. How could you do such a thing?

507
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,640
You fall in love with your heart. Why does how I dress matter?

508
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,690
I am not saying I will be with you forever.

509
00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:00,460
I know full well that I must leave you when the time comes.

510
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,940
But now is not the time.

511
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,660
You still need me, Your Highness.

512
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,900
Just like how I need you.

513
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,890
When the time comes, I will ask Sergeant for forgiveness myself.

514
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,260
So you should...

515
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,110
no longer tell me to leave as well.

516
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,100
I already made up my mind.

517
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,390
So Eun came to Hanyang in order to participate in the Princess Consort selection.

518
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,540
- Father. 
 - She is not used to life here.

519
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,800
You should take good care of her as her older cousin.

520
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,400
So Eun, you should consider him as your brother, too.

521
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,150
I am in your care, Orabeoni.

522
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,940
   

523
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,840
This is Court Lady Kwon, Your Highness.

524
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,440
Court Lady Choi brought news.

525
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,060
 Crown Prince came back after getting shot with an arrow. 

526
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,000
 A physician is currently treating him. 

527
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,400
He must have gotten shot with an arrow in Paju.

528
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,390
Did you order them to...

529
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,430
put away Oh Man Shik's body?

530
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,570
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,430
I told them to bury him with his family where it gets good sunlight.

532
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:08,510
 Go Soon Dol is wary of Guardian Warrior, and he carries a dagger around. 

533
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,430
Should I tell him to be careful?

534
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,430
Get your taffy!

535
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,850
Tasty taffy is here! Get your taffy!

536
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,820
- Get your taffy!
 - Scholar Park.

537
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,700
It's taffy. Taffy.

538
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,350
Does it not look so tasty?

539
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,320
I happened to have gotten paid today.

540
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,780
I will get some sweet taffy for you.

541
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,740
So you are telling me to just eat taffy? 
  (TR/N: It's "yeot" in Korean, "eat yeot" means "screw you") 

542
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,960
 Go eat taffy! 

543
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,470
So...

544
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,310
are you still not satisfied, even after insulting me like that?

545
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,110
- That is not what I meant– 
 - I am okay.

546
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,070
Go ahead and help yourself.

547
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,730
That was forever ago! You small-minded bastard.

548
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:20,410
I do not like him these days.

549
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,740
 I am in love with someone else. 

550
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,530
 I have someone I secretly love. 

551
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,110
Do you love someone?

552
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,500
Are you secretly in love? How does that make any sense?

553
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:51,220
Is that why you are angry at me right now?

554
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,540
You little... There really is a man you love?

555
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,880
Did you think it was a woman, then?

556
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,450
Who is it?

557
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,840
There is no way...

558
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,550
- It cannot be a eunuch, can it? 
 - Am I a fool? To love a eunuch?

559
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,880
Who is it then? If not a eunuch or a court lady or...

560
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,800
Could it be...

561
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,170
someone outside the palace?

562
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,700
It is someone who goes in and out of the palace.

563
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,740
- Give me the name. 
 -Try to guess.

564
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,240
It is someone very stupid. I always send sparks with loving looks,

565
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,060
but he has no idea.

566
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,750
He is intelligent, but he is a dimwit who does not know how to read the air.

567
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:57,690
Saying that now makes me wonder why I like him.

568
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,500
That is good. Just forget it.

569
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,780
- Why do you like someone so pathetic? 
 - It is up to me!

570
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,450
It's my heart. It belongs to me! Furthermore, it is none of your business.

571
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,410
It is your heart and your life. Do whatever you wish.

572
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:19,830
Idiot!

573
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,510
Someone who commutes to a government office in the palace.

574
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,610
Department of Archives. Department of Imperial Orders, Imperial Library,

575
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,450
Office of Secretary, Royal Academy,

576
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:28,720
Royal Bodyguard Unit, Royal Clinic...

577
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,420
- Stay away from me. 
 - Pardon?

578
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,570
Do not be so close to me. Stay away!

579
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,580
Two steps further.

580
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,040
Go!

581
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,400
Eunuch Go and Friend, you are here!

582
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:35,240
It is especially nice since I have not seen you in a while!

583
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,010
Why are you walking like that?

584
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,230
- Did you get injured? 
 - It is nothing!

585
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,490
I got beaten by my mother with a broom.

586
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,500
My buttock just became a bit battered.

587
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,410
Really.

588
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,200
But why are you laughing?

589
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,280
Student, tell him why I was laughing.

590
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,500
A woman...

591
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,490
who is in love with him

592
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,020
visited the daughter of the Minister who is in marriage talks

593
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,890
- and asked her to reject the proposal. 
 - That is right.

594
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,860
Her Ladyship, who heard that from the Minister of General Affairs,

595
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:19,820
beat up his buttock like this!

596
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,070
And got it all battered.

597
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,340
That is right!

598
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,310
Which part of this story made you so happy?

599
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:30,050
There is a woman who is in love with me!

600
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,340
She apparently watched me for a long time.

601
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,610
She went to the woodpecker herself and asked her to give up on me!

602
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,770
Have you met a spunky woman like that in the entire Joseon?

603
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,410
I guess you like spunky women.

604
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,680
Is your mother your type, then?

605
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,480
Do not say something so ridiculous.

606
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,970
She must be extraordinary.

607
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,510
She is the one who recognized my hidden charms.

608
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,190
Not just her looks, but her heart must be fine as silk.

609
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,600
She must be full of brilliance.

610
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,410
Have you not noticed whenever you visited me?

611
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,870
- The glance from a woman who admires me? 
 - I have not.

612
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,490
Gosh! Impossible!

613
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,440
There must have been a beautiful woman who was watching me.

614
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,970
I have not seen such a woman.

615
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:15,260
Eunuch Go, have you seen her?

616
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,740
I have not even seen her shadow.

617
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,380
What would you do even if you saw the spunky woman?

618
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,120
Will you read the Autopsy Dictionary together or something?

619
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,310
Do you think she would read that with me?

620
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,500
Who would read a book all about dead bodies with you?

621
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,980
He read it with me.

622
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,290
No, no.

623
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,830
I saw that woman.

624
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:48,920
It is her!

625
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,770
She was standing in the courtyard of Manyeondang, looking like a painting!

626
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:57,030
 That woman was me, you fool. 

627
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,590
I could tell her sincerity just from the back of her head!

628
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:06,290
Her affection for me led her to step on the courtyard I had stepped on.

629
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,740
I walk around in that courtyard every day.

630
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,600
Do not try to deny it.

631
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,610
Even though you are jealous of my popularity.

632
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,030
Come on...

633
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,510
So are you okay that you got dumped by that woodpecker woman?

634
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,930
Gosh! I do not look back at the past.

635
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:31,520
She must have watched me heading to Manyeondang

636
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,820
today, too, while standing somewhere

637
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:40,410
on the street with her longing heart.

638
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:45,310
Let us go! This popular Myung Jin will treat you to a spread!

639
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,920
Gosh...

640
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:52,230
Will you be okay?

641
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:54,540
Are you okay?

642
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,120
Look at you!

643
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,260
Oh my, nice!

644
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,730
The people from Manyeondang are here.

645
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,270
Dal Rae, it is them.

646
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,770
People who gave money to Meo Roo.

647
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,670
I have always wanted to thank you.

648
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,420
Thank you so much, sir.

649
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,840
Thank you, sir!

650
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,090
Are you feeling better now?

651
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:27,270
Yes, I recovered, thanks to you.

652
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:31,980
Thanks to you, my sister is no longer sick and we are not hungry, either.

653
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,250
These two are almost bleeding us dry these days.

654
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,900
They eat so much!

655
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,430
Your faces look brighter, and your clothes look clean.

656
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,030
I am glad you are doing well.

657
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,300
Thank you so much for caring for them.

658
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,520
Do not mention it.

659
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,200
We just did what you asked us to do.

660
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,370
- We live here now. 
 - You do?

661
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,800
Well... um...

662
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,900
We have been to their shed before.

663
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,880
Leaving them there felt like a waste of the effort we put into feeding them.

664
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,090
We do not have our own children.

665
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,780
We just let them sleep with us in our room.

666
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,530
We are happy to have children to call our own.

667
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,790
How wonderful!

668
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,590
Let me see.

669
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,130
What is the situation inside your stomach today, Meo Roo?

670
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:24,930
- It is totally empty. 
 - What?

671
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,940
You even had three bowls.

672
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:32,520
It is a problem that your stomach is empty even after having three bowls.

673
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,540
Should we eat until our stomachs explode today?

674
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,480
- You little! 
 - Be careful! Gosh.

675
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,650
Come here!

676
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,490
AGoodness! Stop!

677
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,110
Stop that!

678
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,540
Are you sure it was my bracelet?

679
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,770
Yes.

680
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,720
I will check properly if I see that lady again soon.

681
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,970
That troublemaker youngest son of the Chief State Minister is surely famous.

682
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,810
The Crown Prince visits him often, you said?

683
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,860
Along with that man named Go Soon Dol?

684
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:18,650
That is the same place that Go Soon Dol frequented while collecting ledgers for

685
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,880
the oyat tree case, correct?

686
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,550
Did you notice anything suspicious inside?

687
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,000
I could not find anything in particular. However...

688
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,050
This was on the wall there.

689
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,330
A wanted poster for Min Jae Yi, the daughter of

690
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,210
Gaeseong governor, who is being chased for murdering her family.

691
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,560
There were many of them on the wall, not just a few.

692
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,470
It was found in the place that the Crown Prince frequents.

693
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,980
There must be some connection.

694
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,890
"Maiden Min Jae Yi, whom I love"?

695
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:06,760
 Your Excellency, may I come in for a moment? 

696
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,700
What is it about?

697
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,590
A man is here to see you.

698
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,270
He said he was a slave manager.

699
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:20,960
He said he needed to talk to you regarding a slave who ran away.

700
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,370
Why are you bothering His Excellency because of some slave manager?

701
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,140
I will chase him away.

702
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,120
Just leave it.

703
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,910
Let me just hear what he has to say.

704
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,440
Forgive us for wanting to see you, Your Excellency!

705
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,050
Yes.

706
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,660
Do you have something you need to tell me?

707
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:58,140
I won again! I won again!

708
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,620
He won, he won!

709
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,250
Hold on, hold on! We need to redo it. That was weird.

710
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,620
How come you are so bad?

711
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,870
It is because I got beaten by my mother!

712
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,790
Do you even know how to play Jegi yourself?

713
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,300
You do not even know how to shovel.

714
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,620
- You had better not provoke me. 
 - I am sure you cannot beat me.

715
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,690
I picked up Jegi off the table on my first birthday.

716
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,860
I was born kicking Jegi!

717
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,430
I kicked Jegi inside my mother's womb!

718
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:23,870
I am from a family with generations of Jegi masters.

719
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,540
I have never heard of a family like that.

720
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,290
Gosh! Why do you not just have a match?

721
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,620
The one who loses pays for the meal. What do you think?

722
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,600
Did you already forget it was supposed to be your treat?

723
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,080
I guess you are not confident enough to bet.

724
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,100
What do you mean, not confident?

725
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,840
Stop arguing with your mouth and just have a match.

726
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,280
Could you please...

727
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,150
Will you be okay? Your wound is still–

728
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,970
I am okay. Do not worry.

729
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,890
Step aside.

730
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,910
Gaeseong's murderer, Min Jae Yi's servant girl dressed as a man

731
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,660
and became a student at Manyeondang?

732
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,200
That is correct, Your Excellency.

733
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,550
I thought I finally would get to treat you to a meal, Friend.

734
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,700
But that's not happening! Thank you, Friend!

735
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,890
Should I ask for a different dish?

736
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:38,670
It is okay. I like red bean porridge.

737
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,830
It grew on me.

738
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,450
Gosure! 
  (T/N: A ritual where one wishes to avoid illness by throwing food on the ground) 

739
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,560
Come now. What are you doing?

740
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,040
Why are you throwing precious food many people worked hard for?

741
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,770
You cannot treat food like that.

742
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,910
Aigoo! Dal Rae taught your brother well!

743
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:09,830
I should do Gosure, too. Okay. Gosure!

744
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:14,860
They are giving it to bugs or animals so we can coexist. It is a folk custom in Joseon.

745
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,220
My parents taught us when we lived in our hometown.

746
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,310
When people are hungry, bugs or animals are hungry, too.

747
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:27,510
They said we have to share food with them even if we do not have enough.

748
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,010
Gosure!

749
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,190
Gosure!

750
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,500
I was ignorant.

751
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,890
Thank you for letting me know.

752
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,580
How nice! How nice!

753
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,960
We have to have a tune on a night like this. Do you not agree?

754
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,100
Who will be singing a song, then?

755
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,800
One of the pretty scholars...

756
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,850
The eldest scholar!

757
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,870
I do not know how to sing. You cannot make me sing.

758
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:14,850
What do you mean you do not know how? You just sing however you feel. That is how you do it.

759
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:18,320
You have to have a musician and an instrument in order to sing—

760
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,960
Here comes an instrument.

761
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,560
- What is this– 
 - Friend. You have to carry around an instrument

762
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:29,370
to do your duty as a scholar of Joseon.

763
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,310
I brought mine with me!

764
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,580
What is wrong with these people?

765
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,700
Gosh, my arm! My arm!

766
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,740
Since shy Scholar Park is refusing,

767
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:50,870
- I will sing a song for you! 
 - All right!

01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:56,590
We tried to catch Min Jae Yi using her as bait,

780
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:01,760
but only... three men frequented Manyeondang.

781
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,910
 One is the owner of Manyeondang. 

782
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,770
 And I know who one of the rest is. 

783
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,160
 But the last one is... 

784
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:32,350
I also know...

785
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,390
who the last one is.

786
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:41,280
If you pay us a bit of commission fee, we will catch the servant bitch, at least.

787
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,190
If we catch her and question her, we could catch Min Jae Yi soon, too.

788
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:52,000
Even if we caught Min Jae Yi, all we can do is send her to Royal Investigation Bureau.

789
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,890
However...

790
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:58,340
you came all the way here. I should at least pay you for that.

791
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,460
You can eat sufficiently for at least a month with that.

792
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,510
I will take care of the servant bitch.

793
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,000
You no longer have to worry about her.

794
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,160
Look, everyone!

795
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,860
S-S-Someone...

796
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,830
died up there!

797
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:38,630
Someone died! Hurry up! Let's go! Hurry up!

798
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,640
Dal Rae, go inside the room with Meo Roo!

799
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,970
Go inside.

800
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:45,840
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

801
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:58,510
Go Soon Dol. I was wondering who you were.

802
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:01,110
You were Min Jae Yi.

803
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,400
The Crown Prince...

804
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,020
let a woman in the Palace as a eunuch!

805
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,510
What should we do? It is the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs!

806
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,970
Somebody notify the Office of Hanseong!

807
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,390
How scary!

808
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,950
 The fact that you are the least desired husband material among the Hanyang women does not change. 

809
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:51,710
 That is why you should end this marriage discussion. 

810
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:53,400
How did this woman...

811
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,270
Do you know this woman?

812
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:58,420
She is the daughter of the Minister of General Affairs who was considered to marry Young Master Myung Jin.

813
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,270
I ran into her once.

814
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,430
What happened?

815
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:15,820
She... She suddenly ended up this way.

816
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,310
We were on the way to a stationery shop.

817
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:23,520
I opened the carriage when we arrived, and she threw up blood...

818
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,190
My Lady!

819
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,750
My Lady...

820
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,470
My Lady...

821
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,290
My Lady...

822
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:06,010
 Did you exchange this with him as the symbol of love? 

823
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,910
Gosh! Officer!

824
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,380
Officer!

825
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,690
How come you are...

826
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:51,060


827
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,910
   

828
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,370
 A person died, and she stole her bracelet? 

829
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,550
 The bracelet belongs to Min Jae Yi, the murderer of Gaeseong. 

830
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:27,740
 A chance to dethrone the Crown Prince landed on my lap. 

831
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:31,740
 Do you like the Eastern Palace or the Crown Prince? 

832
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,190
 I will arrange your marriage quickly. 

833
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:36,030
 Your wife will be the daughter of the Han family of Yeongsan. 

834
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,980
 What kind of person is His Highness? 

835
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,740
 I will be thinking of His Highness every day. 

836
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,610
 He will be thinking of me, too, right?
