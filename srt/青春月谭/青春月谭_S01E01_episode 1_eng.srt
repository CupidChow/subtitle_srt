1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,530
   

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,570
   

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,280
   

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,560
   

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,690
   

6
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:25,065
   

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,020
   

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,000
   

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,160


10
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,070
   

11
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,040
 Your Highness, 

12
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,520
 are you awake? 

13
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,550
Your Highness.

14
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,550
Enter.

15
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,430
   

16
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,830
 Do you know that the Crown Prince, His Highness, cannot use his right arm? 

17
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,010
I know!

18
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,790
One year ago, he was hit on his right shoulder by a poisoned arrow while hunting.

19
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,910
They say that his arm became rotten black inside of his royal robe.

20
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,610
Completely rotten!

21
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,150
They couldn't even catch the culprit!

22
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,140
Is that not strange?

23
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,480
Supposedly, no unauthorized person entered the royal hunting grounds.

24
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,180
There are rumors about how it is all because he was cursed by a ghost.

25
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,720
What?

26
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,430
Why would a ghost curse His Highness?

27
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,150
The reason why a ghost cursed His Highness is...

28
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,510
Crown Prince Ui Hyeon used to take baekchool and changchool extract, 
  (T/N: Parts of the Atractylodes japonica root) 

29
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,510
but it can be deadly if you take them along with peaches.

30
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,860
But someone fed him a peach.

31
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,350
After he ate the peach, Crown Prince Ui Hyeon passed away.

32
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,280
But they say that the one who gave him the peach is...

33
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,950
Whom, whom?

34
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,360
The Crown Prince, His Highness!

35
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,610
 He killed his brother 

36
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,340
 so he could rise to the position of Crown Prince by feeding him peaches! 

37
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,670
 No way! 

38
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,830
 No wonder he was cursed by a ghost! 

39
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,340
"Don't look down on your subordinates while you're in the upper seat."

40
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,120
"Don't drag your superiors down while you're in the lower seat."

41
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,260
"If you keep yourself in good standing and do not require things from others,

42
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,350
no one will find fault with you."

43
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,240
"You will not blame the heavens above, nor will you blame the people below."

44
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,410
"Don't look down on your subordinates while you're in the upper seat."

45
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,490
"Don't drag your superiors down while you're in the lower seat."

46
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,620
"If you keep yourself in good standing..."

47
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,650
He still didn't move his right arm at all?

48
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,950
It is clear he cannot even hold a brush with that arm.

49
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,630
Why else would he not have been able to write one word in the past year?

50
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,290
Gosh, seriously.

51
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,940
To think that Crown Prince has become disabled...

52
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,100
What do you mean by "disabled"?

53
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,820
Your Excellency, it is just that nobody has seen him move it,

54
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,020
- nobody said he was disabledâ€“ 
 - We can't

55
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,560
place someone who is disabled on the throne.

56
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,140
I must check for myself.

57
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,270
Do you have a way to check?

58
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,760
Why wouldn't I?

59
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,270
Did you just say hunting?

60
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,000
My apologies, Your Majesty,

61
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,410
but the Crown Prince will become the master of the nation and the top Confucian scholar and military leader.

62
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,350
Since the Crown Prince isn't handling all of his responsibilitiesâ€“

63
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,460
What do you mean, "he's not handling all of his responsibilities"? How could you dare speak such nonsense?

64
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,440
Ever since he was appointed crown prince,

65
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
he has shown exceptional ability in academics,

66
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,090
and he has always received top marks during the royal education assessment,

67
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,630
and he's already outstanding in physical form, so everyone knows that he is a Crown Prince

68
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,360
with both, scholarly and military prowess!

69
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,690
It appears that the Left Minister has not ever gone outside the palace before.

70
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:17,680
Rumors have spread to the streets that the Crown Prince

71
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,450
cannot use his right arm.

72
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,150
Your Majesty, please root out those who are spreading rumors on the streets

73
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,680
about what is happening in the palace first!

74
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,400
His Highness is already kicking those people out himself.

75
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,690
 Oh, gosh! 

76
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,350
 Did you get kicked out, too? 

77
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,970
 He said my stocking smelled. 

78
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,210
 Wow, I can't believe it. 

79
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,850
 He said the water was too hot yesterday, so I cooled it just right today. 

80
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,380
 But today, he's making a fuss, saying it's too cold. 

81
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,720
 - What does he want us to do? 
 - I know! 

82
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,890
 Which one is it? 

83
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,090
 Your Highness, I will bring the water reheated for you. 

84
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,500
 You also should go and change your stocking. 

85
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,150
 There is no need. 

86
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,200
 Don't you dare show up at the Crown Prince's palace again. 

87
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,090
 Your Highness! 

88
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,110
 Your Highness... 

89
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,690
 There are so many palace workers who have been kicked out 

90
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,120
from the Crown Prince's palace!

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,260
Your Majesty.

92
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,530
We are only saying this out of our loyalty to the nation

93
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,150
and only desire to check the strength and vigor of the Crown Prince!

94
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,740
Well, what are your thoughts, Chief State Minister?

95
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,140
Your Majesty,

96
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,460
the Right State Minister's words are correct,

97
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,340
and the Left State Minister's words are also correct.

98
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,370
Would it not be the desire of all of your people

99
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,700
for the Crown Prince to be healthy and strong?

100
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,630
It just happens that there will be a military training hunt in a fortnight.

101
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,970
How about you have the Crown Prince lead the military training hunt,

102
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,120
so as to relieve your servants' worries?

103
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
Would it not be a good opportunity for everyone to see His Highness's vigor?

104
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,100
Yes, do not tolerate any longer these blasphemous rumors.

105
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,040
Please show everyone that the Crown Prince

106
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,740
is healthy and strong, Your Majesty.

107
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,580
 Please show them, Your Majesty. 

108
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,440
The court officials are trying to have you lead the hunt.

109
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,110
If they would have me lead it, then I will do so.

110
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,280
Will you fulfill what they are seeking?

111
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,990
This was bound to come sooner or later.

112
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,550
So what's the problem for it to have come a bit sooner?

113
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,800
Will you...

114
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,990
be able to do it?

115
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,730
Is there any other way for me to keep

116
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,390
my position, aside from doing that?

117
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,160
 - Are the preparations going well? 
 - Yes, Your Ladyship. 

118
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,120
 - Everything is going well. 
 - Good, good. 

119
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,090
Your Ladyship, where shall I place the parasol?

120
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,320
Put it in the back of the house.

121
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,260
Be careful.

122
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,520
Please hurry.

123
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,050
Where shall I put the lanterns?

124
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,920
Place them on the wooden hallway floor.

125
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,410
Hurry. If you're ready, start transporting them.

126
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,540
Look here!

127
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,160
Is this the residence of the Left State Minister, His Excellency?

128
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,850
Yes, it is.

129
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,750
Your Highness.

130
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,860
Is your right arm really fine?

131
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,050
Are you really thinking of going to the military training hunting grounds?

132
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,790
You said you are leaving for Gaeseong to pick up your fiancee.

133
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,050
I am sorry.

134
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,720
Especially with the Forbidden Marriage Edict in place from the selection of the Crown Princess...

135
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,810
It's a marriage that Father granted, knowing that your marriage was delayed

136
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,840
due to both families losing a loved one in close succession.

137
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
Do not worry.

138
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,160
But I heard that your fiancee is famous in Gaeseong for being a graceful and intelligent woman.

139
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,440
Do you believe those stories?

140
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,940
Have you forgotten that girl you saw at the master's house?

141
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,510
 How did you manage to bring a gift while you were sneaking out of the palace? 

142
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,740
 Some high-quality beef came in, so I stole it from the Royal Kitchen. 

143
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,960
 Is Master not leaving Hanyang soon? 

144
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,760
 If he is leaving for the country of Ming, I do not know when I will see him again. 

145
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,780
 - Be careful. 
 - Hey! 

146
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,550
 Welcome. 

147
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,330
 It is your first time in our district, right? 

148
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,690
 - Who are you? 
 - Me? 

149
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,160
 I am... 

150
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,960
 - I guess the owner of this creek. 
 - How impudent! 

151
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,230
 - Do you know who this is? 
 - Whatever. 

152
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,000
 It's one nyang per person to go through. 

153
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,370
 - In total, that would be two nyang. 
 - You wretch! 

154
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,810
 How can a creek have an owner? 

155
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,860
 - If I say that I am the owner, then I am! 
 - Forget it. 

156
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,570
 Just give it to her. 

157
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,710
 We need to see the master and return before the sun sets. 

158
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,480
 I am giving it to you not because I am afraid of your stick. 

159
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,990
 I will put it to good use. 

160
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,450
 Do not feel too upset about it. 

161
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,500
 Is it true that if we pass through this forest, 

162
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,520
 we can get to Sir Min Ho Seung's house? 

163
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,170
 Do you not know his residence? 

164
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,810
 I know it! He's such an amazing person, so how would I not know? 

165
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,790
 It's not this district, but that district. 

166
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,490
 But that district told us to go to this district... 

167
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,200
 Would I lie to you when I received two nyang from you? 

168
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,970
 Go back across the creek. 

169
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,220
 I am right! 

170
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,900
Have you forgotten how we meandered through another district until late at night?

171
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,540
That was such a long time ago.

172
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,070
She will have changed.

173
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,070
She is not the type of woman to change.

174
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,950
Then...

175
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,170
I can just live completely under her control.

176
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,070
She may not be a graceful woman,

177
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,220
but her righteous and caring heart for people

178
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,590
probably has not changed.

179
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,830
You are right, Your Highness.

180
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,160
Have we not seen what she did with that money?

181
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,350
What would be good as a gift? I already sent one to the Master's house.

182
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,480
Your Highness!

183
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,490
Crown Prince, Your Highness!

184
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,830
- What is the matter? 
 - It was an urgent matter...

185
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,190
Sir,

186
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,000
it appears that you should hurry and go to your residence.

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,080
Did something happen at my residence?

188
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,850
The thing is...

189
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,470
Hurry and tell us.

190
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,430
Did some sudden disaster strike the Left State Minister's home?

191
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,440
A message came from officials in Gaeseong,

192
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,210
saying that the entire family of Min Ho Seung, the governor of Gaeseong,

193
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,230
 was murdered. 

194
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,450
 My goodness! 

195
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,140
 What is this? 

196
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
 Oh, no... 

197
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,440
 My goodness! 

198
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,470
Wh-What happened to my fiancee?

199
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,990
Are you saying that Lady Min Jae Yi is also dead?

200
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,580
- Well... 
 - I asked you if she died!

201
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,300
They say that she is not dead,

202
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,530
but that she was the one who killed them.

203
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,200
Who... Who are you saying killed whom, and how?

204
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,570
They say that Lady Min Jae Yi killed her family by poisoning them.

205
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,510
Murder by poisoning...

206
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,620
Who...

207
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,120
Who made such an outrageous testimony?

208
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,660
I am sorry,

209
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,050
but it was Lady Min Jae Yi's lover.

210
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,180
Are you saying that the woman who was about to get married

211
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,340
had another lover?

212
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,540
 He is an orphan whom the governor raised like an adopted son. 

213
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,620
 He and Lady Min Jae Yi were like siblings, 

214
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,950
 but there are supposedly many rumors all over Gaeseong. 

215
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,750
Father...

216
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,740
 Saying that they had been having illicit sexual relations for a long time. 

217
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,850
 He confessed that the Lady personally purchased arsenic 

218
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,150
 and killed her family. 

219
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,670
 And provincial officers in Gaeseong say they have found corroborative evidence. 

220
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,550
 What happened to Min Jae Yi? 
   

221
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,140
No one is at the government office.

222
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,270
She is not in the rooms either.

223
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,060
 By the time the officers came, she had already fled. 

224
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,840
Send someone to Gaeseong right away and assess the situation.

225
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,660
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,480
I think it would be good for you to go straight to your private home.

227
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,270
She should not have been able to get that far.

228
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,210
She is a felon who murdered the entire family of the governor of Gaeseong.

229
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,940
We must chase and catch her!

230
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,620
- Disperse and find her! 
  - Yes, Sir! 

231
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,770
Stop right there!

232
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,390
Return to your leader and tell him that I am not the culprit.

233
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,090
The evidence is clear!

234
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,200
You talk too much for a criminal who committed such a horrible sin of murdering your entire family!

235
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,500
I am not a murderer!

236
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,760
Please just let me pass.

237
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,160
I will prove my innocence, no matter what!

238
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,330
It's Min Jae Yi!

239
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,890
Min Jae Yi is here!

240
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,430
Catch her!

241
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,850
We cannot afford to lose her!

242
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,940
Geez, what do we do about our young master?

243
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,100
I know. On this good day, when he should be getting married,

244
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,730
how could this happen?

245
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,080
How much did she dread marrying our young master

246
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,550
that she would kill her entire family?

247
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,570
Stop saying useless things, and come!

248
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,320
How could she have relations with a man that she grew up with, like siblings under the same roof,

249
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,370
and also kill her parents and older brother?

250
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,280
Just up until this morning, she was about to become the wife of the Youngsan Han family's chief.

251
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,770
How could you simply believe the rumors?

252
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,750
It's not just a rumor. The one involved in that dirty rumor is the one who confessed.

253
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,940
I am so ashamed even to face the servants...

254
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,010
- Goodness. 
 - An entire family was destroyed in a single moment.

255
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,600
And I have lost a friend.

256
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
Father.

257
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,510
There must be some misunderstanding.

258
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,940
You are the eldest son of the Youngsan Han family.

259
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,340
Do not concern yourself with personal feelings and be cautious with your actions.

260
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,800
 The Left State Minister's house must be... 

261
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,450
 like a funeral home right now. A funeral home! 

262
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,250
Gosh, how could things turn out like this?

263
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,080
How could this happen?

264
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,750
Things just took care of themselves without us having to get involved!

265
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,620
Right!

266
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,210
I mean, imagine how much of a headache it would have been

267
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,790
if the Governor of Gaeseong and the Left State Minister were to become in-laws

268
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,210
and their power and influence grew?

269
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,270
I know.

270
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,400
Gosh. It wasn't just anyone,

271
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
but he died at the hands of his own daughter...

272
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,540
What is the point of having Confucian scholars follow him around?

273
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,110
He raised his daughter like that!

274
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,300
But thanks to this, the Left State Minister's spirit will be slightly weakened.

275
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,890
What good news is this to us?

276
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,160
But still, you should watch your words.

277
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,820
Goodness, we are by ourselves, so why not?

278
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,760
- You are too cautious. 
 - Is anyone out there?

279
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,680
There is nobody there?

280
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,320
 What is this... 

281
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,760
 I really cannot understand this. 

282
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,650
All the women will be inspected separately, so stand to the left.

283
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,540
What is this all about?

284
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,140
The Governor's daughter killed her entire family by poisoning them.

285
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,030
What a wench deserving of death!

286
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,220
She is not an animal, so how could she do that to her own family?

287
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,610
It seems that is the girl!

288
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,800
   

289
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,190
You may pass.

290
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,310
You may pass.

291
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,580
 My Lady, please stay safe. 

292
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,030
 Please survive and let us meet again. 

293
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,390
I am not a criminal.

294
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,200
I did not kill anyone!

295
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,280
Arrest her!

296
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,140
 Father. 

297
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,890
 Mother. 

298
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,900
 Orabeoni... 
 (T/N: Old Korean for older brother) 

299
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,540
 I am sorry. 

300
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,190
Orabeoni!

301
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,240
Mother.

302
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,570
Mother!

303
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,070
Father!

304
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,340
Father!

305
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,310
Orabeoni...

306
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,200
 If I'd known you would pass away so soon, 

307
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,260
Mother!

308
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,200
 I would have been a better daughter. 

309
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,820
 Jae Yi! 

310
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,250
 Wake up, Min Jae Yi! 

311
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,180
 Jae Yi. 

312
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,750
 No! 

313
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,440
 You must survive! 

314
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,980
   

315
00:27:51,850 --> 00:28:01,700
   

316
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,080
Look, is anyone out there?

317
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,360
- Yes, Your Highness. 
 - Who entered this room?

318
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,040
There must be someone who came into this room while I was sleeping!

319
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,320
No, Your Highness.

320
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,860
No one came in here.

321
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,410
If no one came in,

322
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,070
then how...

323
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,000
then how did this...

324
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,570
Your Highness...

325
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,950
Why are you being like this?

326
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,540
Did really no one come in here?

327
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,070
Your Highness, it is the first day you moved into the Crown Prince's palace.

328
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,260
We were awake all this time to make sure

329
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,440
that we would not neglect any of your needs.

330
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,570
Nobody has come by, so what is the matter, Your Highness?

331
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,200
 A ghost dares to say to Yi Hwan. 

332
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,010
 You should take heed to these words. 

333
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:08,740
 You became Crown Prince by killing your brother, but you will never become king. 

334
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,450
 Despite having arms, you will not be able to use them. 

335
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,860
 And, despite having legs, you will not be able to walk. 

336
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,490
 You will grow old alone without a wife and will die lonely without any children. 

337
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,550
 Your friend will turn his back on you and aim his sword at you, 

338
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,810
 and many will be killed as a result of your foolishness. 

339
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,890
 The people will drag you down and depose you. 

340
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,000
 You will wander through all the land mad, 

341
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,830
 and your cursed fate will only end with your death. 

342
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,190
Goodness, it is good to see our Grand Prince eat so well.

343
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,430
It is good. You should eat some too, Grandfather.

344
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,000
- It is good, right? 
 - Yes.

345
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,270
It appears that our Grand Prince takes after this grandfather's taste buds.

346
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,740
Uncle,

347
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,660
I heard that you were having the Crown Prince appear on the hunting grounds.

348
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,280
He refuses to show us if his arm is okay. I have no choice but to check for myself.

349
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,360
How about giving the Crown Prince a bit more timeâ€”

350
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,840
Are you outside, Court Lady Ahn?

351
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,240
- Yes. 
 - Escort the Grand Prince.

352
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,990
Yes.

353
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,430
Your Highness.

354
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,980
Are you concerned that the Crown Prince cannot use his right arm,

355
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,320
or about the rumors going around

356
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,200
that he might be perfectly fine?

357
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,150
Of course, he should be healthy.

358
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,910
However, I do think otherwise.

359
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,990
Your humble servant wishes that on the day Crown Prince stands on military training hunting grounds,

360
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,960
he is not able to lift the bow.

361
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,170
If Crown Prince is able to lift the bow, he should not be able to pull on the bowstring.

362
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,540
Crown Prince must be disabled, as the rumor says.

363
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,520
For the sake of Your Highness and Grand Prince.

364
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,020
Uncle.

365
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,820
How could you say such a thing?

366
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,280
I have never once considered such a thought in regard to Prince Myung Ahnâ€“

367
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,930
Do not consider anything!

368
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,590
I will do all the thinking.

369
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,750
What I consider must also be what you consider.

370
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,170
Therefore, Your Highness...

371
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,890
In the place I have set up for you in that position, just be still. That is all.

372
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,280
You just have to trust in this uncle...

373
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,460
That is what I am saying.

374
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,280
Do you understand?

375
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,910
Oh, no...

376
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,300
You were concerned for no good reason.

377
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,130
You suffer from heart pain.

378
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,190
Are you all right?

379
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,260
- Your Highness. 
 - What is this about?

380
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,530
The cavalry dispatch rider you had sent to the Governor with the wedding gift...

381
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,740
Did he return?

382
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,550
I hear he was found as a corpse.

383
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,690
At what location?

384
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,400
 While they were chasing the heinous murder suspect for the Gaeseong family, 

385
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,900
 they had found him already dead. 

386
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,350
 What did they do with the corpse? 

387
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,590
Tell them to send him back to me. I will take care of him personally.

388
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,430
Yes, Your Highness.

389
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,460
By chance, do you know if he was killed on his way there

390
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,160
or on his way back?

391
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,800
Seeing how the gift that you had sent over was missing,

392
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,710
it must have happened on his way back. However,

393
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,960
how would we ever know?

394
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,670
Do you think Min Jae Yi also killed the dispatch rider?

395
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,970
There is no reason for her to kill him.

396
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,380
But still, it is strange.

397
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,130
You had sent a gift to that family

398
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,000
and the entire family died, and now even the dispatch rider as well.

399
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,260
Continue to look into Min Jae Yi.

400
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,870
You will have to pay special attention to it.

401
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,610
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,210
Send your trusted men and follow Lady Jae Yi.

403
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,770
We must find her before Gaeseong's army.

404
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,520
- Yes, Sir. 
 - And...

405
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,020
find out the whereabouts of that lover.

406
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,110
Yes, I got it.

407
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,830
 It must... 

408
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,850
 not be true. 

409
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,650
 There must be... 

410
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,360
 another reason. 

411
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,120
   

412
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,600
The government officials are coming.

413
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,270
Hurry, My Lady!

414
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,560
You must run away quickly!

415
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,730
You cannot stay here like this!

416
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,830
Young Master Shim Young confessed that you added arsenic to their soup.

417
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,330
You must hurry! You cannot stay here!

418
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,000
I cannot go. What about the funeral?

419
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,780
Even if you stay here, you cannot oversee the funeral!

420
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,390
Listen to me carefully, My Lady.

421
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,360
You have become...

422
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,670
a murderer who killed your own family.

423
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,810
Please...

424
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,860
Please pull yourself together, My Lady!

425
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,250
Please...

426
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,040
Do you...

427
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,320
Do you believe me?

428
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,700
Yes. I do.

429
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,740
I do believe you, My Lady.

430
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,430
I can even bet my life on it.

431
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,320
Can you promise me?

432
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,930
Yes. Anything.

433
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,600
Please say so, My Lady.

434
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,930
Ga Ram.

435
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,060
How about the lady?

436
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,270
She has not come today, either.

437
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,830
The day we promised to meet has passed long ago.

438
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,880
I wonder if she is even alive...

439
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,200
 Read it. The Crown Prince sent a secret letter along with your wedding gift. 

440
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,100
 Why are you trying to show me a secretive letter that His Highness had sent for you? 

441
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,930
 It is a secret letter that you should read. 

442
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,130
Father!

443
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,210
 Jae Yi... 

444
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,850
 His Highness... 

445
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,670
 You must... 

446
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,250
 protect His Highness... 

447
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,610
 Father! 

448
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,800
 Father, no! 

449
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,300
 I must meet the Crown Prince. 

450
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,430
 My family's death... 

451
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,510
 is connected to Crown Prince for sure. 

452
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,170
 I'm sure the Crown Prince knows 

453
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,730
 the reason why my family was killed. 

454
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,940
I think you are ready to stand on military training hunting grounds.

455
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,380
The position of the crown prince has no room for compromise.

456
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,900
It has to be for someone superior.

457
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:38,940
   

458
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,060
   

459
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,660
Your Highness, are you all right?

460
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,990
What is the matter all of a sudden?

461
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,240
Did you also hear

462
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,010
that I have been cursed by ghosts? I heard that is what people say.

463
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,750
It is just a rumor that foolish people made up, Your Highness.

464
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,930
   

465
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,440
Now that my master's entire family has been killed, even worse rumors will go around.

466
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,730
The proof that his daughter, Min Jae Yi, poisoned them is as clear as day.

467
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,590
How could that be the ghost's curse? That is preposterous, Your Highness.

468
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,040
Is there truly such a thing as a ghost?

469
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,950
Even if I have been cursed by it,

470
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,680
I will not be shaken.

471
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,620
I guess they still have not found the body. The murderer, that Min Jae Yi bitch.

472
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,920
I heard it's been over two weeks since she fell off a cliff.

473
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,490
But they still have not found her body. That's why they're still going crazy like that.

474
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,910
The body, you say? Did she fall off a cliff? Did she die?

475
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,490
Where did you hear that? Are you sure she died?

476
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,470
Who cares? Geez, that vicious bitch. Where did she run off after killing her entire family?

477
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,890
The fact that she's a young lady of a noble class is also a false rumor.

478
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,110
She stole her brother's clothes every night and played around with men.

479
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,320
- Geez! 
 - It was fine. Who did this?

480
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,170
What are we going to do now?

481
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,180
Mister, I didn't do that!

482
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,250
 - You didn't? 
 - Let's clean up. 

483
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,260
 What are you doing? Hurry! 

484
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,010
My Lady...

485
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,230
Again, again, again!

486
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:21,210
What's this? I take them down, and they put up another.

487
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,650
I mean, do they have nothing else to do at the Royal Investigation Bureau? There are so many murder cases in Hanyang.

488
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,600
Right. What are your thoughts?

489
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,760
- What do you mean... 
 - What else could it be?

490
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,150
This nonsensical rumor says our Maiden Min Jae Yi poisoned her own family!

491
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,500
It is all a false rumor! Maiden Min Jae Yi is innocent. Do you understand?

492
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,020
When you also see this wanted poster, be sure to rip it up right there and then.

493
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,080
Tear it into pieces. Do you understand?

494
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,310
Who is there?

495
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,420
Do I smell? Do you smell something from my body?

496
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,360
Whoa, they sure know how to sniff like a dog. See you again.

497
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,620
- Did you do this? 
 - No, I did not. A nobleman did this...

498
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,850
He went that way.

499
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:52,280
By chance, did he walk around with a monkey paw hanging like this?

500
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,240
- Y-Yes, Sir. 
 - Again, again, again!

501
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:01,650
It must be the Chief State Minister's youngest son. Geez. What a crazy nut.

502
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,150
Chief State Minister's youngest son would be... the one who's infamous in Gaeseong...

503
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,730
The one who likes a cemetery over his own home.

504
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,740
That slightly insane guy?

505
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,280
You came.

506
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,890
Who do you think I am? I'm your servant, Jang Ga Ram.

507
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,510
I'm so glad... that you're alive, My Lady.

508
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,190
Why do you want to go inside the capital? It will be more dangerous for you.

509
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,180
What are you looking at?

510
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,400
My Lady...

511
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,440
Ministry of Justice, Office of Inspector General, and Royal Investigation Bureau who can reinvestigate the case

512
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,300
are all inside the capital.

513
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,000
Let us just go somewhere far from here together, My Lady.

514
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,710
I am innocent. How can I live my whole life in hiding?

515
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,660
If anyone asks you which regiment you belong to, you can say Troop Byeol affiliated with Choongmuhoe.

516
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,050
Thank you.

517
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,130
I shall... surely repay you for this.

518
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:41,480
Your family threw a 60th birthday feast for my lowly father and freed him by burning his slave contract.

519
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,300
Compared to the grace your family has shown us, this is... This is nothing in comparison!

520
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,090
Take Ga Ram with you.

521
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,720
No, My Lady! I belong to you. You promised you would take me with you even after you married.

522
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,160
I will not walk down a flowery road. It will be a tough, thorny road. How can I take you with me?

523
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,700
That is why I will go with you, My Lady. As long as I live, I will live withâ€”

524
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,590
My Lady!

525
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,160
My Lady!

526
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,380
You will only be a burden to me.

527
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,630
I know you do not mean what you say.

528
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,660
How can I send you away by yourself?

529
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,440
I will surely clear my name and look for you.

530
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,160
- Ga Ram... 
 - You are telling me you will abandon me.

531
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,140
Do you think I fear the point of this dagger?

532
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,900
I will go with you.

533
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,540
There will soon be a wanted order for me as well.

534
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,450
I am already a slave on the run.

535
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:52,010
The moment I left Gaeseong following after you, my life was already as good as dead.

536
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,200
"Loyalty is not reserved only for men."

537
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,180
Is that not what you said to me?

538
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,520
You will be wandering around on thorny grounds.

539
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,600
How can I sleep comfortably with my head on the pillow?

540
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,190
I am giving you order as your master.

541
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,300
I cannot carry out that order.

542
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,240
I am telling you as your friend!

543
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,620
I am worried about you as though we were sisters...

544
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,710
Please, I beg you.

545
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,800
Please stay by your brother's side.

546
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,610
Will we ever... meet again someday?

547
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,400
You can trust me. I will definitely make it so.

548
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,500
My Lady...

549
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,360
Be careful.

550
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,220
Please take good care of Ga Ram.

551
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,840
- My Lady! 
 - My Lady...

552
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,800
My Lady...

553
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,240
My poor Lady...

554
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,130
 My Lady... 

555
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,900
 My Lady, what to do... 

556
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,620
   

557
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,440
Look there.

558
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,540
Where do you belong?

559
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,400
We belong to Ohhoe. Troop Byeol.

560
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,250
Looks like you went on a patrol. You have not heard about the order, have you?

561
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,320
We are assigned to serve at Crown Prince's military training hunting grounds.

562
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,090
But we stayed up all night and were patrolingâ€”

563
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,110
Where should we go?

564
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,600
They are leaving from Gyeongju. Follow us now.

565
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,120
It is great weather for hunting.

566
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:32,420
What will you do if Crown Prince cannot prove that his right arm is healthy

567
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,810
that you threw His Highness into the trap that they have set up for him?

568
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,210
If he cannot prove himself,

569
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,360
I will depose him.

570
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,780
Your Majesty, it has only been three years since we have a new crown prince.

571
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,340
There is one more grand prince remaining.

572
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,730
So what worry is there for this nation?

573
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,370
 How do I meet the Crown Prince? 

574
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,380
 It would be difficult to get another opportunity to do so. 

575
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,280
Do you know Crown Prince?

576
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,820
Do you think he could even lift a bow?

577
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:23,090
During this hunting trip, he has to prove that his right arm is not crippled.

578
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,000
Hear ye, civil and military officers and military forces.

579
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,600
The military training hunt is taking place in hopes of prosperity and peace among the people.

580
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,500
It is an event for everyone to unite.

581
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,680
In place of His Majesty,

582
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,970
I will personally hunt for a sacrifice to offer for our nation today.

583
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,390
Heaven will show great favor upon Joseon's land.

584
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,100
Giddyup!

585
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:01,540
   

586
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,080
   

587
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,730
 Despite having arms, you will not be able to use them. 

588
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,120
 And, despite having legs, you will not be able to walk. 

589
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,940
 Your friend will turn his back against you and aim his sword at you. 

590
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,720
   

591
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:32,160


592
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,610
   

593
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,670
 I definitely saw your secret letter, Your Highness. 

594
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,770
 From a ghost... 

595
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,700
 You said you received a letter of curse from a ghost, three years ago. 

596
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,480
 Wicked things have occurred nonstop as soon as I met you. 

597
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,520
 I'm as good as dead anyhow. 

598
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,380
 Stop. 

599
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:58,150
 A trick played by a ghost? 

600
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:02,800
 Is it one of you? The one who dares to play the Crown Prince? 

601
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,560
 There are no ghosts in this world. 

602
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,280
 I will solve these cases.
