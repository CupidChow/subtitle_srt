1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,810
   

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,460
   

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,060
   

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,390
   

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,780
   

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,300
   

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,980
   

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,160
   

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,430
   

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:51,130


11
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,840
   

12
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,960
To think that the one responsible for all those wicked deeds was the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau...

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,170
So no one knows

14
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,200
why the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau tried to kill four of my people...

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,970
Are you telling me none of you know why?

16
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,050
   

17
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,120
 O, Chosen One. You who will fulfill the prophecy, 

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,920
 now hear my voice. 

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,900
 When you respond with the sword of the earth, 

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,640
 complete the will of the divine spirit with the lives of four human beings. 

21
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,340
 Human history is marked by the four phases of life. 

22
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,650
 The only thing that can wash away one's sins is death. 
   

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,210
 Unless you die, you cannot live again. 
   

24
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,690
 There must be death before a new world can come. 

25
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,680
   

26
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,670
Song. Family. Destruction.

27
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,100
The last character is still unknown...

28
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,280
 After killing three people, what was she trying to tell 

29
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,380
 by killing one more person? What was the last character? 

30
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,670
 What was her goal? 

31
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,880
She carved characters on the people she killed!

32
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,790
We should interrogate her to find out the last character, Your Highness.

33
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,230
Your Highness, terrible attempts to sway the people's hearts have taken place in recent years.

34
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,730
Defiling the celebratory message at the hunt Crown Prince participated in

35
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,090
was also a dirty trick to play on the confused state of the people's hearts.

36
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,010
The Sergeant captured the culprit and had her brought to the Royal Investigation Bureau,

37
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,850
but she is not speaking.

38
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,310
If we start interrogating her, we should be able to find out her motive.

39
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,790
We can no longer entrust the Sergeant with this matter, Your Majesty.

40
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,990
For some reason, whatever Sergeant handles, things turn out this way.

41
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,770
That is right, Your Highness.

42
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,080
If you would entrust me, the Minister of Justice,

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,810
I will make sure to expose the Head Shaman's sins!

44
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,900
Your Highness.

45
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,890
The Sergeant will definitely solve the case involving the celebratory message.

46
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,720
Also, the Sergeant is heading toward the Shamanist Bureau to find corroborative evidence.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,500
 Where would you find another servant who works so hard for peace in this land? 

48
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,730
Even though we do not doubt Sergeant's loyalty,

49
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,600
I am worried about how much longer the people will live in anxiety.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,990
Your Majesty should personally interrogate the criminal soon and reveal her ugly motive

51
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,340
and console the anxious hearts of the people.

52
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,950
Yes, Your Highness. Please personally interrogate the criminal!

53
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,550
 Your Highness, please hold an interrogation! 

54
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,900
 Your Highness, please hold an interrogation! 

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,960
 Your Highness, please hold an interrogation! 

56
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,180
Break down the door!

57
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,100
 Yes, Sir! 

58
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,390
Let them loose.

59
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,060
Yes, Sir.

60
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,450
What were the trespassers looking for?

61
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,630
They dragged us out to the courtyard and tied us up,

62
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,040
so we do not know what they were looking for.

63
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,460
However, we saw them go into the shrine of the head shaman who was arrested by the Investigation Bureau.

64
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,960
Was there anything off about the head shaman recently?

65
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,550
After she came back from a prayer site in Gaeseong about a month agoâ€“

66
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you saying the head shaman's prayer site was in Gaeseong?

67
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,870
The exact location is not known to the maid shamans

68
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,170
but they had heard that it was near Songak Mountain.

69
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,080
 If it was about a month ago... 

70
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,980
 A message came from officials in Gaeseong 

71
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,710
 saying that the entire family of Min Ho Seung, the governor, was murdered. 

72
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,070
 It's around the same time as the death of my master's family. 

73
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,860
Also, based on the testimonies of the maid shamans...

74
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,050
 Around that time, 

75
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,210
 her hair started turning white, and we started smelling something strange... 

76
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,390
 Incense smell. We smelled incense. 

77
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,190
But it is common to smell incense at the Shamanist Bureau.

78
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,670
They say it was not the incense used at the Shamanist Bureau.

79
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,080
They sent assassins to steal the corroborative evidence.

80
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,450
The head shaman was not alone in this.

81
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,140
Yes. This is not a simple murder case.

82
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,600
This case also appears to have someone in the background.

83
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,680
What do you think is their goal, Your Highness?

84
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,290
It must have something to do with the last character.

85
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,350
Is there any character that comes to mind?

86
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,400
 Gaeseong... 

87
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
 Songak Mountain... 

88
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,390
 Is this relevant to my master's death? 

89
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,580
   

90
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,420
 Is he not coming today either? 

91
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,320
Gosh, it appears Manyeondang's Young Master got locked up again.

92
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,300
Gosh, I have not seen him for the past few days.

93
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,900
I'm sure his mother, Honorable Lady, got upset and locked him in his room.

94
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,780
Does this happen often?

95
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,050
The lady of that house has quite the temper.

96
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,540
Around two months ago, when we asked him why he was limping,

97
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,190
he said that he got hit by the pestle she threw at him.

98
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,990
What?

99
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,780
By chance, was my master born of a concubine?

100
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,580
Gosh, no way.

101
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,490
If the man of stature, Chief State Minister, were to get a son from a concubine,

102
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,190
even he would get beat up by his wife.

103
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,200
Is she to that extent?

104
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Does the Honorable Lady not know anything about the duties of a wife?

105
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,170
- No, no. 
 - My gosh...

106
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,790
Gosh, that oddball Young Master needs to come

107
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,210
so I could ask him about the happenings in the palace.

108
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,650
Since his father is the Chief State Minister, he would have heard some things.

109
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,670
- About what? 
 - The rumors say that

110
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,620
the one who caught the head shaman responsible for the Sabangahn case

111
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,860
was a eunuch from the Eastern Palace.

112
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,640
What?

113
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,870
I heard he collapsed, bleeding after being hit by the crock lid the head shaman threw.

114
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,910
Gosh, I do not know if he's dead or alive.

115
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,510
What's wrong with him?

116
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,420
But where did your husband go?

117
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,680
He went to the mountain.

118
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,180
In case someone might have dug up the herbs he saw last year.

119
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,010
Geez, we are busy as it is!

120
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,280
Gosh, seriously.

121
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,270
Are you okay?

122
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,610
- Oh, no! 
 - Wait.

123
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,860
I am sorry. It was my fault...

124
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,450
But what is the name of that fish?

125
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,250
I have never seen it before. Its colors are unusual.

126
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,330
What would a wandering monk know?

127
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,140
I heard that it was a fish from afar.

128
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,110
I am just taking care of it for someone for the time being.

129
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,980
Oh, I see.

130
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,160
I am so sorry. Your gourd bottle broke, too...

131
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,380
It is all right.

132
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,090
All right, then.

133
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,740
Oh, yes.

134
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,570
I feel like I have seen him before.

135
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,150
Now is not the time to be like this!

136
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,440
My Lady... What do I do about My Lady!

137
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,300
I gathered the medicinal ingredients and made a decoction as you commanded.

138
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,500
She will wake up before it cools. Wait a bit.

139
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,380
Do I have to keep making it as I do for your decoction, Your Highness?

140
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,640
- Why not bring in a royal physicianâ€“ 
 - There is a reason we cannot.

141
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,270
Your Highness...

142
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,170
Are you awake?

143
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,280
How are you by my side?

144
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,590
Do you not see me?

145
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,030
Do you not see this either?

146
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,460
Gosh, how could you...

147
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,690
You should talk nicely to someone who is injured.

148
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,040
You should know how to say thank you.

149
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,860
Thank you.

150
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,920
I personally made this decoction. Keep that in mind.

151
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,420
Are you feeling all right?

152
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,630
How long have I been sleeping?

153
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,490
You slept for an entire day.

154
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,870
You and the Sergeant saved a child's life.

155
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,040
Do you remember it?

156
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,990
Your Highness,

157
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,760
will you...

158
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,750
believe me now?

159
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,710
Have I passed your test, Your Highness?

160
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,170
I have believed you

161
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,420
for a long time now.

162
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,860
Why do you cry? Are you in much pain?

163
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,450
Do you know how precious your trust is to me?

164
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,620
If you turn away from me, Your Highness,

165
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,840
I could be dead today.

166
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,270
You have worked hard,

167
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,380
even getting hurt like this.

168
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,270
Since when did you start trusting me?

169
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,000
When was it...

170
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,250
Perhaps, I have trusted you from the start.

171
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,610
I believe that my master would not have raised his daughter to become a murderer.

172
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,080
How could I let a physician see you when you are a woman?

173
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,610
Did you only injure your forehead?

174
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,280
Do not touch it. It finally stopped bleeding.

175
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,040
Lift your head.

176
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:45,600
â™«  Just like you, my eyes are growing red  â™«

177
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,650
â™«  I just stand here  â™«

178
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:58,170
â™«  Right by your side  â™«

179
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:10,830
â™«  Without being able to say anything  â™«

180
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,900
When did you learn medicine?

181
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,180
I vaguely heard in my sleep that you prepared all these medicinal ingredients.

182
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,550
My former masterâ€”

183
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,060
Did my father...

184
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,240
tell you to learn medicine?

185
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,390
Since it is about saving lives,

186
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,650
he said it would be useful if I learned the basics.

187
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,350
So, I just read some medical books.

188
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,140
Your Highness...

189
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,630
please tell me...

190
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,820
more about your master.

191
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,130
My master...

192
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,150
told me studying is not only about reading books.

193
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,640
He always told me that a serious scholar does not stop at just learning academics,

194
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,760
but must also reach the level of putting things into practice

195
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,030
for the sake of the people.

196
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,520
He was always deeply concerned about the people.

197
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,680
He also said I should place importance on formalities and statutes,

198
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:31,320
but the moment of realizing the meaning of the world comes from breaking such formalities.

199
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,380
Just when I thought he was too strict, he was flexible.

200
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,020
Just when I thought he was calm and peaceful,

201
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,840
he was strong...

202
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,900
and fiery.

203
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,690
He was that kind of a person.

204
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,350
Also,

205
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,340
he was a kind person.

206
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,730
 I do not believe 

207
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,330
 it is right to say, "When a woman marries into another family, 

208
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,330
 she should become that family's ghost." 

209
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,990
 Then what? 

210
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,200
 If married life is difficult for you, come back at any time. 

211
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,770
 I will not be the father who refuses to take back his daughter. 

212
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,720
 Yes, Father. 

213
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,130
He was not tied down by words nor locked behind the literature.

214
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,930
Whenever he was studying academics or dealing with others,

215
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,790
he knew to see beyond what was readily visible.

216
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,690
He was a great man.

217
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,090
You are right.

218
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,260
My father was that kind of a person.

219
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,950
She could not have gotten proper treatment since she had to hide being a woman.

220
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,370
She is still alive, right?

221
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,570
I cannot even get a glimpse of my master, either!

222
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,090
What do I do!

223
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,770
It has been a while, but should I try jumping this wall?

224
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,740
- Gosh, you scared me! 
 - Gosh, you scared me!

225
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,220
- Master! 
 - Student!

226
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,040
- Are you locked up in your home? 
 - That is correct.

227
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,690
Do you not know how to jump a wall?

228
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,600
It just happens that I was trying to do so.

229
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,560
Just wait a bit.

230
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,120
Excuse me?

231
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,440
Be careful...

232
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,950
Are you here because you were worried about me?

233
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,650
Yes.

234
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,920
Jump down, Master.

235
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,700
Will you really catch your master?

236
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,120
No doubt about it.

237
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,150
Please jump down.

238
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,760
My student!

239
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,840
Seeing you jump made me question whether I could catch you...

240
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,100
You should know that before telling me...

241
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,950
to jump...

242
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,710
Gosh, my back... Let go!

243
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,570
Young Master.

244
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,960
Oh my.

245
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,130
That is good.

246
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,280
Did you starve?

247
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,730
Although my mother's temper is like fire and she locks me up sometimes,

248
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,790
but she does not starve me.

249
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,880
But my nature is such that,

250
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,040
if I do not eat in a place filled with other people like this,

251
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,740
I do not feel like I have eaten. How nice is it?

252
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,610
It is fun to look around at people,

253
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,570
and it is warm and friendly to be around others.

254
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,190
So why did you get locked up in your home?

255
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,480
What do you mean "why"?

256
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,920
It is because I go around doing useless things.

257
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,430
Then will you keep jumping the wall every time?

258
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,410
No. I will be able to go through the front gate soon.

259
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,300
- My parents are discussing my marriage. 
 - Excuse me?

260
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,540
The daughter of the Minister of General Affairs.

261
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,510
On top of that, she's the one people say you can take home without seeing her face.

262
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,980
Their third daughter!

263
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,520
You are thinking of getting married?

264
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,300
There is a forbidden marriage edict due to Crown Prince's royal nuptial.

265
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,970
So, I cannot get married right away.

266
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,680
But the daughter of the Minister would have gotten

267
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,290
so shocked by rumors about me.

268
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,440
Thus, she said she would come and see for herself who I am, even if she lives far away.

269
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,530
Since we do not know when that would be, I was told to act modestly.

270
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,110
So they will not keep locking me up at home.

271
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,820
Gosh, she was so shocked from just hearing the rumors?

272
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,840
She would be shocked even more when she sees you in person.

273
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,150
Oh, right. What about Manyeondang?

274
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,150
Did anything happen there?

275
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,870
Oh, right.

276
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,420
How could you forget such an important thing, you stupid idiot!

277
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,960
Master, have you heard of any news from the palace?

278
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,100
My Ladyâ€” I mean...

279
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,340
Did you hear about that pretty eunuch getting hurt?

280
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,810
You mean Eunuch Go?

281
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,820
I did hear from my hyungnims that the culprit for Sabangahn was caught.

282
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,150
Why do you ask about Eunuch Go? Did he get hurt?

283
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,270
I mean, why would you ask me that?

284
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,490
- I was going to ask youâ€“ 
 - W-Wait, wait.

285
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,960
Wait a second. You came to ask me that,

286
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,010
why did I jump the wall?

287
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,370
Manyeondang. I escaped so I could go to Manyeondang.

288
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,780
I mean, are you not the Chief State Minister's son?

289
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,180
Please find out for me.

290
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,580
My Ladyâ€“ I mean, please find out whether Eunuch Go is okay

291
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,610
and if he is seriously hurt. Please?

292
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,430
Please?

293
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,730
Tavern Keeper, get us some unrefined rice wine.

294
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,160
Yes.

295
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,350
I am here.

296
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,460
Let me see. You are not hurt, right? You are okay, right?

297
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,840
Gosh, of course, I am fine.

298
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,070
Do you know how worried I was?

299
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,040
Do you know how long I waited for you last night?

300
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,580
If you did not come back tonight, I thought maybe you had died...

301
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,420
What is this? Are you hurt?

302
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,300
- No, no... 
 - Where did you get hurt?

303
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,810
It is nothing. Why are you being like this?

304
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,300
You could get hurt while digging up medicinal herbs.

305
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,740
Do not go ever again.

306
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,980
Even if you are given orders, do not go.

307
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,100
I do not need to go back to my hometown.

308
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,020
Where was it this time? Was it the Shamanist Bureau?

309
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,380
You did not kill anyone or anything like that, right?

310
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,480
You would not do such a thing, right?

311
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,130
Kill? Whom would I kill?

312
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,410
How could you say such a scary thing?

313
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,510
- Let me see it. 
 - I am fine.

314
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,970
Let me see if it really is fine. Let me see!

315
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,220
- I am fine. 
 - Just give me your arm.

316
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Gosh, seriously...

317
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,080
We will not take it easy on you just because you got hurt!

318
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,700
Even if His Highness values you, do not forget about duty.

319
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,670
That is what we are saying, got it?

320
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,950
Yes.

321
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,730
I think it worked.

322
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Move!

323
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,050
Wipe the floor cleanly using your strength!

324
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,020
Instead of just wetting the floor half-heartedly!

325
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,710
Yes...

326
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,140
Crown Prince, Your Highness.

327
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Soon Dol, come with me. I have something else for you to do.

328
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,620
What is he suddenly going to have him do?

329
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,140
I thought we would get him to wipe the floor.

330
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,560
Sit down.

331
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,350
What is the thing that you would have me do?

332
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,340
Stay seated. That is what you need to do.

333
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,940
Gosh, my back!

334
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,900
So what if there's a new eunuch at the Eastern Palace?

335
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,240
We are still the only ones cleaning this storage space!

336
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,320
We should get him kicked out as soon as possible!

337
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,160
So how could we do that? His Highness only favors him!

338
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,100
- Then what? 
 - That is what I mean!

339
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,020
There is no end to cleaning this storage.

340
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,310
- Let us get some water. 
 - We need to hurry up and finish this.

341
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,870
Go Soon Dol!

342
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,110
Follow me. I have something else for you to do.

343
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,150
Only Go Soon Dol?

344
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,130
What are you doing?

345
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,320
Why don't you eat it?

346
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,700
Wow, is this tangerine?

347
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,300
I have never seen it in person.

348
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,780
That way, that way!

349
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,640
- That is right. 
 - Further, further, further!

350
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,280
- No, no, this way, this way! 
 - That is right.

351
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,720
- No, no, over there would be better. 
 - That is right.

352
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,390
Right there.

353
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,780
Is His Highness looking for Go Soon Dol again?

354
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,560
You need to go. His Highness wants to see you. You got to go.

355
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,910
Leave. Leave!

356
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,690
Go. Bye!

357
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,590
I should break all these earthenware jars!

358
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,290
His Highness wants you to take medicine.

359
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,350
Go and take your medicine!

360
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,420
It is you, Eunuch Go.

361
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,840
Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,270
I heard you captured the culprit of the Sabangahn murders with Sergeant.

363
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:00,240
My goodness, did you hurt yourself a lot?

364
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,300
No, I am all right.

365
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,160
This is nothing when it comes to serving His Highness.

366
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,320
But you have to be in good health to serve His Highness properly.

367
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,950
I will get the royal physician to bring you medicine. Take care of yourself first.

368
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,950
I am honored, Your Highness. I apologize for making you worry.

369
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,830
How commendable.

370
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,770
He looks like a smart one.

371
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,760
Your Highness, this is Soon Dol.

372
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,640
 Come in! 

373
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,570
I feel a lot better. It is all thanks to Your Highness' care.

374
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,840
   

375
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,800
 I will hear about your family's deaths after I test your ability. 

376
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,980
 After that, 

377
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,000
 I will think about how to use you. 

378
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,570
Tell me about your family's deaths now.

379
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,340
What does the record say?

380
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,670
The record tells me that you were learning your way around the kitchen, three to four months before the murders.

381
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,040
 My Lady prepared the breakfast this morning, too! 

382
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,890
 We did not even go near the kitchen! 

383
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,000
 My goodness, she did not even prepare her own table. 

384
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,270
 Orabeoni! Mother! 

385
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,490
Also, the record tells me

386
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,860
that you asked Master to call off the wedding with the Sergeant to leave with your lover,

387
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,000
but he did not meet your demand.

388
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,720
 That was the first time My Lord raised his voice like that! 

389
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,400
 She went out every night dressed like a man because of that bastard Shim! 

390
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,280
 Since they have been fooling around...They have matching bracelets. They both wore the same jade bracelets! 

391
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,610
 She tried to run away with that Shim bastard! 

392
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,380
That is what the record says. That is why you chose the worst solution.

393
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,490
   

394
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,900
You chose to poison your family and run away with your lover.

395
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,960
You murdered your family by putting poison in their soup according to your decision,

396
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,320
but your lover, Shim Young, could not betray the Governor of Gaeseong, who raised him.

397
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,200
So instead of running away with you, he gave the full account of the case.

398
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,150
That is what your case record says.

399
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,830
Now...

400
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,060
I will listen to your side of the story.

401
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,200
The reason I had a long conversation with my father with my door locked is

402
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,310
 not because of the love affair like the rumor said. 

403
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,550
 But it was because of the secret letter Your Highness sent. 

404
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,290
 I need to go. We need to delay the wedding. 

405
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,800
 It's not that simple. 

406
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,550
 Will you tell His Highness that you have been dressing like a man 

407
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,290
 behind your brother's back? 

408
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,500
 Is it true that you prepared the meal for your family like the record says? 

409
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,920
Is it possible that someone put poison in the soup before you served it?

410
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,180
It is impossible.

411
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,290
The only moment someone could have put poison in the pot was

412
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,740
 the brief moment right in between when I tasted the soup 

413
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,360
 and put the soup in bowls. 

414
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,590
 When I tasted it, there was definitely nothing wrong. 

415
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,270
But the poison appeared after I served the soup to my family.

416
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,940
Did anyone come into the kitchen at the time?

417
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,440
No. I was alone.

418
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,720
How come you did not eat?

419
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,120
I could not eat because I was upset about the secret letter.

420
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,560
Is it true that you purchased the poison, too?

421
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,150
I did not plan to use it on humans. I only bought it because I wanted to study poison.

422
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,720
If so, why did your so-called lover

423
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,220
confess that you put poison in the soup for your family?

424
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:26,880
Are you sure that man named Shim Young is not your lover?

425
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,060
That boy is...

426
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,490
 Today, I want you to teach me this. 

427
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,410
 I can't go home until I finish this. 

428
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,940
 - One! 
 - Yap! 

429
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,420
 Block. 

430
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,270
 Rotate and... 

431
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,460
 One! 

432
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,140
 One! 

433
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,570
That boy was...basically my family.

434
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,060
It's ridiculous to call him a lover!

435
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,300
But why did that man say that he is your lover?

436
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,300
I do not know, either. Why did Young say something like that?

437
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,400
We need to catch the real culprit.

438
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,990
If I go back to Gaeseong, I can go through every single thing,

439
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,650
I am sure I can find the clue for the case!

440
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,790
Before that, there is something we need to take care of first.

441
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,030
You are talking about the ghost's letter, are you not?

442
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:18,540
Where is it? Do you have it, Your Highness?

443
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,230
Do you remember the handwriting of the secret letter I sent?

444
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,420
I do not remember in detail,

445
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,650
but I think it was very proper and energetic, like Songseol style. 
  (T/N: Calligraphic style) 

446
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,810
Did it have the Crown Prince's seal then?

447
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,260
Crown Prince's seal...

448
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,300
I am not certain, but it might have been similar.

449
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,860
To be honest, I cannot remember that day very well.

450
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,300
Open it.

451
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,790
You mean this? Can this be opened?

452
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,400
Are these letters placed in a specific spot?

453
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,590
   

454
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,030
You must have been afraid.

455
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,340
You must have been lonely.

456
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,730
Yes.

457
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,450
I was afraid... and lonely.

458
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,160
You must have felt hopeless because you did not know whom to fight.

459
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,700
You cannot fight a ghost.

460
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,850
You can fight the curse. Do not be consumed by the fear of this paper.

461
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,400
Your Highness, your destiny

462
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,030
will be determined by you, not this paper.

463
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,780
I will be by Your Highness' side!

464
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,840
Whom could it be?

465
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,810
Who could have sent me the ghost's letter?

466
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,300
 The one who shot my arm with an arrow. 

467
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,180
 The one who murdered your family. 

468
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,840
 The one who disgraced the celebratory message. 

469
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,980
And even the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau.

470
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,110
Pardon?

471
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,960
Is the culprit of the Sabangahn case one of those people, too?

472
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,210
Around the time when Master passed, she frequented the prayer site in Gaeseong.

473
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,850
She came to Gaeseong?

474
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:23,310
But because of the Songak Mountain's shape, a lot of people come to pray in Gaeseong.

475
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,430
That is right.

476
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,170
It might not be related.

477
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,560
Where is the head shaman right now?

478
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,100
   

479
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,710
So was it actually birth, aging, disease, and death,

480
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,700
not East, West, South, North?

481
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,270
Sergeant was wrong, and the eunuch was right...

482
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,870
My Lord!

483
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,280
Did the culprit confess?

484
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,060
I apologize, My Lord. She has not confessed to anything yet.

485
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,640
 We lost the evidence. The only thing that is left is the culprit's confession. 

486
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,630
 Her hair started going gray around that time... 

487
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,690
We found the letter you carved on the second body, too.

488
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,720
What was the last character you tried to carve?

489
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,970
You cannot improve or keep anything by remaining silent.

490
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,710
There will be a royal lecture soon.

491
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,040
It would be easier to confess before you get tortured.

492
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,050
There are no ears to hear the prophecy here.

493
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,650
I am the chosen one, the one to achieve the prophecy.

494
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,910
My mission has not failed yet.

495
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,840
When there are ears to listen at the right time,

496
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,110
you will find out the last character then.

497
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,360
There must be some kind of connection.

498
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,890
At the end of a shadow, there is the owner of that shadow.

499
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,530
We must find the owners of every single shadow.

500
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,400
Before the curse written here gets completed.

501
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,600
Before I go crazy

502
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,630
and roam around the eight provinces of Joseon alone.

503
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,330
Your Highness, how could you say something so tragic-

504
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,800
Their goal is written right here!

505
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,010
"Saengmintallyeom.

506
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,330
Yeojigwanpo."

507
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,110
"The people of the country will drag you down from the throneâ€”"

508
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,860
Your Highness.

509
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,730
I will protect you.

510
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,970
Something like that will never happen!

511
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,710
Who could be intending to be doing that?

512
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,610
Other than my brother and I, there is Grand Prince left.

513
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:46,730
There must be people who want to dethrone me and make him the next Crown Prince.

514
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:54,030
It must be Grand Prince Myung Ahn's great-uncle, Right State Minister Jo Won Bo, and the consort kin.

515
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,890
 - Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up! 

516
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,850
Sergeant is like a dog who chases a chicken.

517
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:14,190
Sergeant became the butt of a joke lately.

518
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,780
To run away with another man, his betrothed killed her

519
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,760
parents and brother...

520
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,450
like this.

521
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,750
And His Highness is coddling the lowly eunuch like this.

522
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,540
I feel bad for the Left State Minister.

523
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,910
That bloody celebratory message. They say the shaman did it.

524
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:45,020
Do you not think the head shaman was behind the celebratory message, too?

525
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,980
You are...

526
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,980
much more perceptive than I thought. How come I could not think of that?

527
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,980
If so, who could be causing all this chaos

528
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,100
including the celebratory message incident and the Sabangahn case using the head shaman?

529
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,760
Look at you! I could not think of that!

530
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,090
Of course... You even thought about who might be behind it?

531
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,600
If so, what have you been thinking about...

532
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,520
I... only thought about one thing.

533
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,920
Heaven...

534
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,900
is on our side.

535
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,460
The governor of Gaeseong died, and the Left State Minister is losing his power every day.

536
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,730
I am sure the Crown Prince got scared by the celebratory message incident, too.

537
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,120
What does this all mean?

538
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,900
Heaven's luck is finally! Finally, on our side.

539
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,980
Do you not agree?

540
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,600
Well...

541
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,400
- Yes, I guess... 
 - You are right.

542
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,050
All right, since heaven is on our side,

543
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,590
what should we do at times like this?

544
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,190
- We should drink! 
 - We should!

545
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,000
Heaven's luck, heaven's luck, heaven's luck!

546
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,440
- Bottoms up! 
 - Bottoms up!

547
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,840
 Hyungnim keeps causing trouble. 

548
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,280
So according to what you found,

549
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,300
a eunuch named Go Soon Dol went missing during the flood last year?

550
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:28,260
But he suddenly reappeared at the Crown Prince's Eastern Palace.

551
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,300
I was right.

552
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,500
There's no way that Go Soon Dol is real.

553
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,950
That's right!

554
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,220
Try to get your memories back as soon as possible.

555
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,670
In this case, you are the victim, suspect, and investigator at the same time.

556
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,890
You missed what you saw, and you let the important things escape.

557
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,370
And some things were so small, and you must have forgotten.

558
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:58,770
You must remember what happened that day.

559
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,680
You can do it.

560
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,350
Yes, I can do it.

561
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,550
I will do it!

562
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,460
I will make sure to retrieve my memories of that day.

563
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,730
First, I will go to the shaman's house tomorrow.

564
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,770
I am sure Sergeant has finished searching already.

565
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,780
There might be something he missed.

566
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:22,860
I will check with the investigator's eyes.

567
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,840
Would it not be dangerous on your own?

568
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,320
Are you worried about me?

569
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,780
If so, could you call Scholar Park?

570
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,760
You must have liked that man.

571
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,400
He cannot use a shovel and does not know how to enjoy soybean soup.

572
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,220
Are you saying he was useless?

573
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,420
No, that's not it!

574
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,550
He was pretty dependable when I was walking at night, hiding from patrolmen.

575
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,320
If so, it would be good to send

576
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,700
Scholar Park with you to the shaman's house.

577
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,930
As I understand, he will be busy due to a lecture tomorrow.

578
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,020
Yes...

579
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,120
Do not worry.

580
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,660
I will be careful.

581
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,400
Gosh! That monk.

582
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,910
Why did he look familiar?

583
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,640
Did I really see him somewhere?

584
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:49,160
Gosh!

585
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,960
Cannot believe that His Highness is caring for people like us.

586
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,690
He said the mother and the child must have been greatly shocked.

587
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,030
So he told you to take care of yourselves.

588
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:04,490
He gave white rice and seaweed soup to people like us.

589
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,910
What a luxury this is.

590
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,650
That sergeant who was here that night

591
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:14,710
came by with fabric and cotton for the child, as well.

592
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:17,300
Did the sergeant stop by?

593
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,570
Thanks to him, our child will lie comfortably on a thick blanket.

594
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,680
His Highness gave a name to the child.

595
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,320
My goodness!

596
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,710
What an honor.

597
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:42,960
   

598
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:48,680
"Myeong," as in "bright." "Rae," as in "to come."

599
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,510
 I named him that to "Bring a bright future." 

600
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,500
It has such a great meaning as that?

601
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,780
How unbelievably kind he is.

602
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:01,630
Well... would it be okay if I try holding the child?

603
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,870
Go ahead.

604
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,360
His Highness named you Myeong Rae.

605
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,250
Myeong Rae.

606
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,200
The name suits you very well.

607
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,930
Aren't you Eunuch Go?

608
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:49,760
Sir!

609
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,050
What are you doing here anyway?

610
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,870
- Was it His Highness' order? 
 - No.

611
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,840
I am coming from Yeogyeongbang.

612
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,240
His Highness gave a present to the mother and the child.

613
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,970
There is no way he sent me here because he does not trust you.

614
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:22,310
I was planning to thank you anyway.

615
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,370
I am glad I ran into you like this.

616
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,730
If you did not listen to me that night,

617
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,800
the child who was born in Yeogyeongbang would have died.

618
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,720
I am not the one who saved him. It was you, was it not?

619
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,080
No, you saved him.

620
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,240
There is no way I could have done it alone.

621
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,480
You stopped by Yeogyeongbang, too, did you not?

622
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,980
I think you are a very warm person.

623
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,640
You showed care without forgetting.

624
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,000
His Highness did the same, did he not?

625
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,280
I looked around, wondering if the soldiers had missed anything.

626
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,450
But I do not think there is any evidence here.

627
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,470
Oh, I found this on the stepping stone earlier.

628
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,090
   

629
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,410
That is mine.

630
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,180
I lost it while searching the house.

631
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,910
That is...

632
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:32,860
Napchaeseo, a letter of approval to marry

633
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,810
from the bride's family, is it not?

634
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,630
   

635
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,550
   

636
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,070
   

637
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,600
 What are you peeping on now? 

638
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,720
 A letter of consent came from Hanyang, so Father is writing a response. 

639
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,630
 Are you that happy? 

640
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:12,930
 If our family sends the letter of approval and they notify the shrine, 

641
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,740
 that means we are basically married. 

642
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,140
 Are you that happy about that? 

643
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,070
   

644
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:38,410
 The letter of approval for the marriage from the bride's family has arrived. 

645
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,760
 Therefore, the process of approval has ended. 

646
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,570
 Han Joong Eon's son, Seong On 

647
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,860
 and Jae Yi, Gaeseong's Governor Min Ho Seung's daughter, will be married. 

648
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,400
 I let this known to the ancestors. 

649
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:02,000
Are you... still waiting for that woman?

650
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,810
If that woman comes back,

651
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,450
- will you... 
 - She is apparently dead.

652
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:14,230
She committed a grave sin and brought me shame.

653
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,520
How could I wait for her?

654
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,700
But why are you carrying the letter of approval...

655
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,410
What will you do?

656
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,280
Will you keep looking?

657
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,010
Well...

658
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,100
I will look around for a moment.

659
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,480
Is there anything suspicious?

660
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:26,670
No, but you normally burn incense on this burner.

661
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30,010
But I thought it was strange that there were dried flowers in it.

662
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,920
 He must be heartbroken. 

663
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,070
 I cannot believe he still carries the letter of approval around. 

664
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,780
 Is he waiting for me, by chance? 

665
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,270
 Does he have faith in me? 

666
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,160
   

667
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,650
 Do you still wait for that woman? 

668
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,450
 Sir! 

669
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,360
- What is this about? 
 - I got a message from Gaeseong.

670
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,510
The piece of fabric found in the cave

671
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,780
is indeed the fabric Gaesong governor's family purchased.

672
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,570
The merchant who supplied silk to them confirmed it.

673
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,310
 Of course. I am sure she is still alive. 

674
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:48,770
 She must have changed into different clothes and escaped. 

675
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,410
By the way, there is something strange, Sir.

676
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,680
Lady Min's lover...

677
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,460
- Did you find that man? 
 - We did, but...

678
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,810
You found him, but what?

679
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,560
What?

680
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,800
What did you say?

681
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,830
Did you just say...

682
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,980
that man is dead?

683
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,080
It was suicide.

684
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,820
 He left a will... 

685
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,800
 and he hung himself on the girder of Boo Yoon's living room. 

686
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:27,420
However, the Royal Security Bureau took the will.

687
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,990
What do you mean, they took it?

688
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,600
- What are you talking about? 
 - It was His Highness's order.

689
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,530
For what reason did His Highness take his will?

690
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,130
According to an officer of the Royal Security Bureau who went to Gaeseong,

691
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:58,630
that man named Shim Young was definitely Min Jae Yi's lover.

692
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,660
It was not a false rumor.

693
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,870
That is not possible.

694
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,060
 Lover? 

695
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,890
 Did she really betray me 

696
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,530
 to be with someone else? 

697
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:29,580
 My beloved Jae Yi. 

698
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:39,300
 That boy was basically my family. 

699
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,220
 It's ridiculous to call him a lover! 

700
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:44,740
 I am not testing you based on the rumors that are out in the streets, Your Highness. 

701
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,810
 Without a secret letter from you, 

702
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:50,770
 how could I know what was written in that letter from a ghost? 

703
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:58,710
 Was everything she told me a lie? 

704
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,530
- Bring Soon Dol here immediately. 
 - Pardon?

705
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,370
Why Go Soon Dol...

706
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,570
Bring him over.

707
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:12,800
Bring that man in front of me right now.

708
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,950
 How come His Highness took that man's will? 

709
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:26,100
Do you not hear my order?

710
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,590
Bring Go Soon Dol to me right now!

711
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:57,810


712
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,280
   

713
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,800
 Do not trust anyone. 

714
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,450
 I will not believe anything that comes out of your mouth. 

715
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:08,220
 Let go of sympathy and affection. 

716
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:12,400
 You cannot secure your position by being affected by mere emotions! 

717
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,930
 Drag Go Soon Dol out of here immediately. 

718
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:17,070
 What are the memories that I'm missing? 

719
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:21,030
 Maiden Jae Yi is yet to be found. That case was... 

720
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:23,320
 I depended on you. 

721
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,830
 Because you are someone I have been waiting for a long time.
