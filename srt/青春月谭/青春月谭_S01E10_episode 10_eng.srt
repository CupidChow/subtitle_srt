1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,460
   

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,090
   

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,110
   

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,500
   

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,440
   

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,010
   

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,960
   

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,940
   

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,580
Will you become my friend?

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,770
Your Highness.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,470
I...

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,560
never stopped being your friend.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,650
I will start creating those miracles every day from now on.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,060
I will have a friend, trust that friend,

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,740
and...

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,770
also, protect him.

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,260
We should meet up at the military training grounds soon.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,060
Archery has been so boring because I have not competed against you.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,110
Yes, Your Highness.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:29,120


21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,960
   

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,350
Are you happy that you were able to regain your friend?

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,830
You seem that way.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,150
You have been smiling the entire way back to the palace.

25
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,710
Will you... be my friend, too?

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,460
Do you believe that a man and a woman cannot be friends?

28
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,470
It is not that. It is just that anger is rising up in me again.

29
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,360
Do you know how sad I was when I got kicked out of the palace that day?

30
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,810
Did it feel good to kick me out like that?

31
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,130
Did I not tell you I was sorry about that?

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,110
 I am sorry. 

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Is that it? That was too short and simple!

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,830
Please tell me again properly, with length, complexity, and detail!

35
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,350
"I need you. I want you to be by my side."

36
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,230
Tell me properly, like that!

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,750
 Min Jae Yi, I missed you. 

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
Why do you not say anything?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,250
 How was it for you? 

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,540
 You probably did not think of me while you were at Manyeondang, right? 

41
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,860
Do you not want to say it?

42
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,980
 For me, 

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,670
 the Eastern Palace felt empty because you were not by my side. 

44
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,020
Is it that difficult to apologize to me properly?

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,320
I said it internally.

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,890
Did you not talk to yourself then as well? So I also spoke internally.

47
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,290
- That makes no sense! 
 - Come now.

48
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,290
Did you not listen in when I was talking to myself, Your Highness?

49
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,640
Then would it not be fair for me to hear what you spoke internally to yourself?

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,700
♫  Someone comes toward me  ♫

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,570
It is something you must never know.

52
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,600
How in the world could this be?

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,670
Is it not better than cursing at a chair?

54
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,520
I mean, you even kicked the chair. When you did that,

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,950
you kicked the chair, thinking it was me, right?

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,660
- That is that... 
 - That is that?

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,870
This is cheating!

58
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,560
Enough of that. Go ahead inside and rest.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,080
No, Your Highness. How could I go inside first?

60
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,760
I will escort you to the Eastern Palace.

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,220
The night is late. Go inside first and rest.

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,230
Even though you may be wearing a man's clothes,

63
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,590
I have never forgotten that you are a woman.

64
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:54,510
♫  Quietly on this night, when I think of you again  ♫

65
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,790
Oh, and when you go inside,

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,310
there should be an abundant supper prepared for you.

67
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,660
 So if I miss my meal, who will make sure I eat? 

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,070
 Yet, he does not even ask whether I ate or not. 

69
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,470
I am not the irrational master that you are thinking of.

70
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,070
I told Tae Kang in advance to have it ready. Go inside and eat.

71
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,900
Your Highness.

72
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,140
Are you not hungry, Your Highness?

73
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,180
We walked 2.5 miles together.

74
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,530
Japchae! Beef tartare!

75
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,810
It has been so long since I last saw you guys!

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,330
The yakgwa of the palace is like honey!

77
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,920
It is so sweet!

78
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,170
I am sorry, Your Highness.

79
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,870
I acted without manners...

80
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,620
Please try some. It is so good.

81
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,090
It is so good that you would not notice if someone were to drop dead.

82
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,810
Have you not gone to bed yet?

83
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,080
His Highness has changed a lot.

84
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,690
I felt the same way.

85
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,740
I did not realize you had prepared fireworks for my wedding.

86
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,170
Did you not say that having an extravagant party is not right

87
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,500
for a scholar, Father?

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,830
If we set off sparks, then the entire village would have been roused up,

89
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,690
and it would have been pretty noisy with all the people gathering.

90
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,910
You are my only son.

91
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,730
How could it be an extravagant party

92
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,620
to have the people of our in-laws' village eat, drink, and be merry

93
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,830
at my son's wedding?

94
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,200
It seems it is time for me to clear out what is in here.

95
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,120
I let it sit here for too long.

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,790
I will send the saltpeter to the Gaeseong office through the Military Supply Office.

97
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,410
That girl is dead.

98
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:23,260
Do not spend any more of your heart

99
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,560
trying to find the dead girl.

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,790
It is meaningless.

101
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,160
Once the Crown Princess is chosen,

102
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,570
I will look for another marriage partner for you.

103
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,780
Keep that in mind.

104
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,720
Since the future of our family line is at stake,

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,090
how could I delay it any longer?

106
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,090
I have finally found you, Jang Ga Ram.

107
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,220
Hyungnim, this person is a man, so how could you say he is Jang Ga Ram?

108
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,610
This face looks so much more delicate.

109
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,490
Is it your first time seeing a girl dress up as a man to evade a capture-and-return order?

110
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,290
I am sure it is this girl.

111
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,680
Shall we ambush her right now?

112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,270
What if the slave hunters come for me tonight?

113
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,100
Gosh, it makes me tremble.

114
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,340
No, no! Even if I die,

115
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,680
I will die for my Lady and if I live, I will live for my Lady.

116
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,450
Why did she leave Gaeseong?

117
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,190
Hyungnim, what is the point of knowing the reason why a runaway slave escaped?

118
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,850
Min Jae Yi might be alive.

119
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,640
The reason why she has come all the way to Hanyang dressed up as a man

120
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,440
would be to meet her mistress, Min Jae Yi.

121
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,350
You are thinking of capturing Min Jae Yi also and selling both of them together?

122
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,750
To whom shall we sell the two girls to get paid well?

123
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,910
We should sell them to the Sergeant!

124
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,780
That lewd girl brought dishonor to that young master of the noble family.

125
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,640
You still have a long way to go.

126
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,750
Do you have another place you have already thought of?

127
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,300
I am thinking of turning them over to the Right State Minister.

128
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,770
What use would the Right State Minister have for the two of them?

129
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,720
Have you not heard the stories of the Right State Minister buying all the rumors in the land?

130
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Would not a State Minister of the nation have greater ambitions than the Sergeant?

131
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,110
Things turned out like that?

132
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,940
To save his friend and his friend's family,

133
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,510
the Crown Prince personally stepped in to prove their innocence?

134
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,830
Is he not a prince that would become a benevolent king?

135
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,030
He is quite nosy.

136
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,040
Will you be all right, Your Excellency?

137
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,830
Did you think I started things without any backup plans?

138
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,560
Thank you for telling me what happened.

139
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,700
Then I shall be on my way.

140
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,400
By chance, did no one ask for me?

141
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,930
What do you mean?

142
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,510
- Are you asking me like you do not know? 
 - I do not know.

143
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,940
The red paper with "Song, Family, Destroy, Yi" written on it...

144
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,010
Watch your mouth!

145
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,340
If anyone had contacted you, it would have been for that.

146
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,740
They probably did not contact you since it took place in our neighborhood.

147
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,710
Even if you wore a mask, someone might recognize you.

148
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,210
I heard you went to the Shamanist Bureau the other day.

149
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,190
What ruckus did you cause?

150
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,790
If the plum tree catching on fire in Palace is linked to the head shaman,

151
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,320
then it would involve you, too.

152
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,180
How much of it do you know?

153
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,990
What if someone were to hear you!

154
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,880
I only do what I am told to do. What more would I know?

155
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
If you do what you are told,

156
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,950
you are sure we could return to our hometown, right?

157
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,760
If we do not return?

158
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,550
Do we keep living like this under someone else's name lying about our hometown?

159
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,150
Should I not at least reclaim my name on my family tree?

160
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,230
Why don't we also just go to Naean Village instead?

161
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,250
Stop saying such useless things,

162
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,270
and just prepare an abundance of things to send to Naean Village.

163
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,750
Buddhist priest should be coming soon.

164
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,350
 If the burning of the plum tree 

165
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,460
 has no connection to the Left State Minister... 

166
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,580
 then are the bastards from Byeokcheon really behind this? 

167
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,880
You know that I like alcohol, too.

168
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,720
You are quite a generous master.

169
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,670
I feel so good.

170
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,680
You were amazing today as well, Your Highness.

171
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,030
When you spoke with such dignity and authority at the warehouse in the Sergeant's home,

172
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,180
I felt so refreshed inside.

173
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,310
Are you thinking of the Sergeant?

174
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,570
No.

175
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,630
I was just reminded of the wedding candles I saw in his shed...

176
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,750
When we expose the truth, you will be cleared of false charges of a murderer.

177
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,670
When that happens, you will be able to light those wedding candles.

178
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,150
The Sergeant is a really good person.

179
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,440
As expected of one my father chose to be my husband after much consideration.

180
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,820
However, I was happy about it without even knowing

181
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,820
what a good man he is.

182
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,160
What do you mean by that?

183
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,100
Marriage was not something I could choose.

184
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,340
Think about it. Marriage is done as a contract between two families.

185
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,030
Since I have to do it, it would be better for me to be happy than to be upset.

186
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,840
But did you not say that you were in love with the Sergeant?

187
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,650
- Love at first sight. 
 - Gosh!

188
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,620
There was no time to fall in love. We only met once when we were young.

189
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,340
I had made up my mind to like the Sergeant.

190
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,560
Your Highness, you will soon marry as well,

191
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,890
so it would be good for you to make up your mind like that as well.

192
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,990
You do not need to tell me how I should feel or think.

193
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,970
Then do you plan to dislike the Crown Princess?

194
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,060
I will do as my heart leads me.

195
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,510
I mean, can you like or dislike someone just because you plan to do so?

196
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,860
This is bad...

197
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,830
The Crown Princess is in big trouble...

198
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,890
Do you know how nervous and anxious a woman is before her wedding?

199
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,770
That she would have to marry someone so cold-hearted...

200
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,460
This! This is a problem!

201
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,040
She would share the same bed with him for the rest of her life,

202
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,260
yet she has to marry him not knowing what he looks like.

203
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,090
This makes no sense!

204
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,820
When you become the next king, please change the national law.

205
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,210
You would make a new law where people get married after they share affection for each other.

206
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,450
Is that not a great idea?

207
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,090
You should get to know one another for four seasons!

208
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,440
Before you get married, you should try holding hands and smelling them.

209
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,320
Smell?

210
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,580
You should also try kissing, no?

211
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,620
That way, you would know if you are a good match.

212
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,990
So that in order to sleep in the same bed—

213
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,110
You are speaking of such ghastly things!

214
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,110
How could things be so unless the world was coming to an end?

215
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,310
I feel like a world like that will come very soon.

216
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,540
How strange.

217
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,940
I feel bad for the Sergeant.

218
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,320
Gosh, how much will he have to suffer in the future...

219
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,910
 Marrying another woman? 

220
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,320
 Just be alive, Maiden. 

221
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,130
 I will make sure to find you. 

222
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,230
I want to tell the Sergeant about who you are

223
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,130
before it is too late...

224
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,760
Let me deal with what happens afterward.

225
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,550
Would it not be safer for you to go to the Sergeant?

226
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,940
Having my name cleared comes first.

227
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,040
When I find the ones who killed my parents and my older brother, I won't forgive them.

228
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,630
My family line was cut short.

229
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,230
I will catch them with my own hands and make them pay the price.

230
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,290
If I am given additional time after that,

231
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,000
I will not marry the Sergeant even then.

232
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,000
It would be much happier for me to live as a eunuch like this.

233
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,340
What is in your head that you would think of such preposterous things?

234
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,770
Did you not tell me, Your Highness...

235
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,940
"Yes, you can."

236
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,990
 Yes, you can. Do it. Try it. 

237
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,040
You were the first person to ever tell me that, Your Highness.

238
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,400
So I was able to do as I felt and as I wanted.

239
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,200
Before I met you, things were different.

240
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,670
 Please give this to the young master. 

241
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,190
 Thanks to him, my father was cleared of the false charges and was able to come home. 

242
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,630
 How could we accept such a precious thing? Take it with you. 

243
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,880
 Feed it to the child's father, who just came out of prison. 

244
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,450
 No, no. 

245
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,150
 Please allow us to repay our debt in this way, at least. 

246
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,980
 Here. 

247
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,730
 I always hid behind my older brother's name. 

248
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,830
However, I feel like I have become a useful person now.

249
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,180
Even though it is fake, I have gained a man's name.

250
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,450
 Soon Dol, what do you think? 

251
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,130
 I also think these are serial murders. 

252
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,760
With that name, I was able to speak my thoughts in front of others.

253
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,190
 I was able to save two lives 

254
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:40,490
 and I was happy for being able to see a family smile. 

255
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,350
Sometimes, I think about the child we saved.

256
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,070
I wonder what kind of life that child you named Myeong Rae

257
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,720
will live in this nation.

258
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,740
Because you told me, "Yes, you can.

259
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,090
Do it. Try it."

260
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,850
I was able to save someone's life even though I was falsely accused,

261
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,530
and I was able to prevent the destruction of a household.

262
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,430
All of this was possible because you were beside me, Your Highness.

263
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,100
It was also something I could only do because you were with me.

264
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
Also...

265
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,100
even if I were to get married, would I not be patching holes in the Sergeant's socks?

266
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,330
How could someone as competent as I am be limited to a kitchen for being born a woman!

267
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,270
Also, if the Sergeant decides one day to take in a concubine...

268
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,460
Well, you know my temper, Your Highness.

269
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,530
I will for sure get kicked out for becoming jealous.

270
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes.

271
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,560
I could definitely see you doing that.

272
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,650
I like where I am right now.

273
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,060
How great is this?

274
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,370
If I were to become someone's wife, I could not even have a drink.

275
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,660
So are you saying you will remain by my side forever?

276
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,210
Oh-ho?

277
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,320
That is a great idea.

278
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,640
You provide me with food and shelter and pay me wages, Your Highness.

279
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,850
And now that I know your personality, even your rebukes feel affectionate.

280
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:29,040
And when you become king one day, will I not become the head eunuch?

281
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,110
Says who?

282
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,360
Who says you would become the head eunuch?

283
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,440
- Do you think anyone could be the head eunuch? 
 - Come on, let me!

284
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,230
- What... 
 - Head eunuch! Make me head eunuch, please!

285
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,400
T-This girl...

286
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,360
Since I am a eunuch, I would not grow facial hair anyway.

287
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,530
This job fits me perfectly.

288
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,450
Had I known there was such a good way for me to live without getting married,

289
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,200
I would not have even thought about getting married.

290
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,500
You would become the King, and I would become a head eunuch.

291
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,490
How great would that be!

292
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,520
But what if the Sergeant meets another woman?

293
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,910
Would you still be fine with that?

294
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,200
Well, the head eunuch job appeals more to me.

295
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Make me the head eunuch, please!

296
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,090
Well, sure.

297
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,010
If you say you will not get married and keep wearing the eunuch uniform...

298
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,680
I will make you the head eunuch.

299
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,340
Whoa!

300
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,590
You promised me!

301
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,100
Wow, I will become the head eunuch!

302
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,420
Your Majesty, the Chief State Minister is here.

303
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,780
Your Majesty, the Left State Minister is here.

304
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,560
Have him enter.

305
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,260
Your Majesty, the Right State Minister is here.

306
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,090
Have him enter.

307
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
Your Majesty, will you have some rice cakes?

308
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,970
 I think that is enough. 

309
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,710
 - Your Majesty, 
 - Come on now. 

310
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,180
 these are the rice cakes of the head eunuch. 

311
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,690
 Stop taking this too far. 

312
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,170
We heard back from the family of the Minister of General Affairs.

313
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,670
Mother.

314
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,540
Father. Well, so what happened was...

315
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,610
Having watched you from afar, it appears she has taken a liking to you.

316
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,470
Oh, no, no!

317
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,320
Well...

318
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,540
T-The Maiden said...

319
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,820
Our side... well, so—

320
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,150
Pack your stuff now and go down to Hamjin.

321
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,800
Excuse me? Hamjin? Is there an emergency with Mother's family?

322
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,850
When you arrive, your uncle will prepare a house for you.

323
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,500
I have prepared a government position of the 8th rank for you,

324
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,470
- so after laying low for half a year– 
 - Father!

325
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,320
I am Myung Jin. I am not the eldest hyungnim, nor am I the second hyungnim.

326
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,670
I am your youngest son, Myung Jin!

327
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,070
I got kicked out of Sungkyunkwan, and I did not even take the state exam.

328
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,690
How could I take up a government position?

329
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,970
Is that something to be proud of? If you had tried sooner,

330
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,080
your father would not have had to recommend you for a hereditary appointment.

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,310
My close friend's son has already reached a blue-robe position as a Sergeant and has a bright future.

332
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,090
Do you not feel anything when I say this?

333
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,960
Go down there and hold the position you are given.

334
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,010
When I call you, come back to Hanyang and take up a 5th-rank position.

335
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,260
I will not get involved with you getting promoted

336
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,430
- after that. 
 - No, I cannot.

337
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,520
You waste your time on the streets for pleasure and fun.

338
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,410
How long will you treat life as a joke?

339
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,600
You should now get married as well and have children, and take responsibility for your family.

340
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,920
The moment you come back to Hanyang and get a properly established position,

341
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,650
you will have your wedding right after.

342
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,960
Father, I am not just doing the work at Manyeondang for fun.

343
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,700
Did you not say that human life is as important as manners and laws?

344
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,070
I am trying to do what is needed in Joseon based on my destiny and my talents.

345
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,240
So how could you say what I do is useless, Father?

346
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,580
Just talking to him will not do!

347
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,130
Restrain yourself, wife!

348
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,130
There, there.

349
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,880
Restrain yourself.

350
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,510
Not another word! Pack your bags. Pack immediately!

351
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,140
But Mother.

352
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,650
If you get angry like that, you will grow dehydrated,

353
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,280
since more heat will gather in your veins, which you already have so much of.

354
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,510
This bastard will only come to his senses if he gets his head smashed with an inkstone!

355
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,930
Whoa, please put that down!

356
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,600
It has only been ten days since I bought that!

357
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,570
Let us resolve this through words, my wife!

358
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,520
Yes, yes, that is expensive, Mother.

359
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,350
You must keep it in.

360
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,300
Please hold it in. You did well.

361
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,970
They say that being patient three times keeps woe at bay.

362
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,580
- But he refuses to listen when I speak nicely! 
 - But you still need to be patient.

363
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,240
Aigoo, you look so good together.

364
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,220
Instead of concerning yourselves with me getting married or getting a government position,

365
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,560
please live a happy life with each other.

366
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
That bastard, seriously!

367
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,470
Please, keep it in!

368
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,410
Great, you are doing well. Aigoo.

369
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,200
Hello.

370
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,000
Gosh, where did you go so early in the morning?

371
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,330
And what are all these?

372
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,770
- These are all things to patch. 
 - You do all this by yourself?

373
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,790
I guess you are right. I have a lot today.

374
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,070
Then give me one of these.

375
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,040
I mean, not that I will do it.

376
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,620
My mother...

377
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,940
She is really good at sewing.

378
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,420
Oh, really?

379
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,290
Then should I ask for her help?

380
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,100
Yeah, you will not regret it because she is really good with her hands.

381
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,750
You will pay her generously, right?

382
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,980
Oh, of course!

383
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,380
Why did you not keep your promise?

384
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,180
Did you not promise to break up the marriage from your end, Young Master?

385
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,780
Did you think of my words as a joke?

386
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,310
I am sorry, young lady. The thing is—

387
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,760
By chance,

388
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,620
have you fallen in love with me?

389
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
No, that is not true!

390
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,580
I do not even know you well enough for me to give you my heart...

391
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,460
I mean, I do not mean to say that you are not beautiful...

392
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,370
- If you are not in love with me, 
 - Woodpecker!

393
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,110
do you think of my future as a light joke?

394
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,620
Did I not already tell you that I do not want to marry you?

395
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,930
Do you know how scared I am that rumors of our marriage talks might spread?

396
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,750
Okay.

397
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,420
I will tell my parents as soon as possible...

398
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,130
You promised me. I am leaving under that assumption.

399
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,860
Gosh! How dare you touch me with your dirty hands that touch corpses!

400
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,570
Gosh, I hate this! I hate this so much! So gross!

401
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,890
Lady! Are you all right?

402
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,780
That rude bastard!

403
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,540
Did you see his face? You did not?

404
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,650
What were you doing, not catching a glimpse of his face?

405
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,480
Some of his bad luck rubbed off on me.

406
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,760
Gosh, what do I do!

407
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,110
How am I supposed to wear this dirty thing!

408
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,870
Gosh, she's nothing!

409
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,370
I came across a woodpecker on my way here.

410
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,610
Did it come to visit you by chance?

411
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,780
Did you not say that you would flatten her nose the next time you see her?

412
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,410
Did you tell her everything you planned to say?

413
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,100
I was not able to...

414
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,400
Not even a single word...

415
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,850
Why? What is it? Come on.

416
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,080
- Why were you not able to? 
 - Women are weak beings.

417
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,690
No matter how harshly she speaks, she is still someone weaker than me, so how could I hurt her feelings?

418
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Is that why you let yourself get pecked by that woodpecker?

419
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,920
You should have humbled her by flattening her nose!

420
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,540
How is the woodpecker weak? It is not weak at all!

421
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,140
From what I can see, Master, you are much, much weaker!

422
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,880
You are right. Myung Jin is weak...

423
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,320
I am like the utterly weak cicada larva that cannot even squirm

424
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,650
after being pecked by the woodpecker's relentless beak.

425
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,080
Gosh, stop that!

426
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,210
You should not cry, okay?

427
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,210
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince is here.

428
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,910
Let him in.

429
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,660
So they got these ledgers by following the eunuch of the Eastern Palace?

430
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,680
Are they not so presumptuous?

431
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,220
Right after the plum tree incident, they used their families all over the country

432
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,660
and dared to mention Gamseon.

433
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,880
Also, not only did they steal the ledgers by following the eunuch of Eastern Palace,

434
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
they used them to get rid of Left State Minister.

435
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,880
Father, you cannot just dismiss this matter.

436
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,680
 Your Majesty, Right State Minister is here. 

437
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,560
Let him in.

438
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,690
Your Majesty, did you have a comfortable night?

439
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,150
Is His Highness also here to ask how His Majesty is?

440
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:38,520
Oh, I heard His Highness was impressive at Left State Minister's house.

441
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,260
Were you reporting to him about that?

442
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,470
You must have a morning assembly soon.

443
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,570
You must have made a serious mistake since you came to see him yourself.

444
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,740
How could that be? Looks like you think lightly of my loyalty.

445
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,890
What mistake? The evidence I acquired

446
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,050
is related to the plum tree arson case, which cursed the royal family.

447
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,980
How could I just remain quiet as his subject?

448
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,950
Your Majesty.

449
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,630
I was passing by a general store and noticed a carrier found a package.

450
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,800
When I opened it, these were in there

451
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,700
and one of these belonged to a store that happened to be right in the front.

452
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,810
So I went inside and asked the owner.

453
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:25,200
According to him, someone from the palace took his ledger.

454
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,430
So I had no choice but to look through them because they sounded important.

455
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,820
Did you not think about asking what department of the palace he was from?

456
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,670
By chance, was it someone from the Eastern Palace?

457
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,920
Aigoo, my goodness.

458
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,500
I did not know that.

459
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:51,310
However, even if I knew that, should I have gone to you

460
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,520
in that situation?

461
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,770
Or should I have run to His Majesty and reported to him about it?

462
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:02,770
Do you not think that your careless action framed the innocent Left State Minister's family?

463
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,270
If he were innocent, the Royal Investigation Bureau would have found out by following the law.

464
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,800
Why did you interrupt the officer's duty who was

465
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,380
following His Majesty's order like so?

466
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,640
Did you defend them because Left State Minister's son, Sergeant Han, is your friend?

467
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,290
If so, is that not a serious matter?

468
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:26,490
Your Highness, the foundation of the country cannot separate public and personal matters

469
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,760
and you revealed that to the whole world.

470
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,120
Right State Minister!

471
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Left State Minister and Sergeant were innocent.

472
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,110
Your Majesty, what Right State Minister was doing was not to report to you but to frame this country's minister!

473
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,940
- You should investigate him for calumny-
 - Your Majesty!

474
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,070
Why did you do Gamseon?

475
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:53,130
You decided to do it because the lightning struck the plum tree due to Heaven's anger.

476
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,720
But if that was someone's evil plan to put a curse on the royal family,

477
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,470
I should catch the culprit quickly and prove Your Majesty's innocence.

478
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,680
I believed that was my duty as your servant.

479
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,350
It was due to my loyalty.

480
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,030
Your Majesty.

481
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,790
Please listen to my plea.

482
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,240
In this case...

483
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,260
Right State Minister did the right thing.

484
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,150
He did what he did because of his loyalty.

485
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,630
The Crown Prince cannot get involved in politics.

486
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
Understand your duty and be cautious.

487
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:52,220
Also, the plum tree arson case was not Heaven's doing.

488
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,000
So please do Bokseon.
    

489
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,860
Isn't that the Left State Minister?

490
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,680
You can understand the disturbance last night, right?

491
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,250
Isn't that how it is to work for the country?

492
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,540
How can framing a minister of this country be considered working for the country?

493
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,400
Can you not distinguish loyalty from greed?

494
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,360
When something distressing happens to the King, you must be willing to disgrace yourself,

495
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,200
and when the King gets disgraced, you must risk your life and be nothing but devoted as a loyal servant.

496
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,680
While His Majesty was even doing Gamseon, not only you were not loyal to him,

497
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,660
you took advantage of the royal family's worries.

498
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,960
Come on.

499
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,910
How could you say something so awful in my face?

500
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,660
How could I have doubted you?

501
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,630
However, I cannot break the law of the country as a minister.

502
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,600
Whether it's the Royal Investigation Bureau or the King's order, it is all a matter of procedure.

503
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:32,430
Also, you never look concerned no matter what happens.

504
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,830
Your son has an important position as the sergeant and he is even His Highness' friend.

505
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,270
I am just saying you must feel very secure.

506
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,240
I am envious.

507
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,300
Do you mean the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat from 10 years ago?

508
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,810
I will find out what happened in Byeokcheon

509
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,500
10 years ago.

510
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,940
Did you not memorize the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat already?

511
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,040
The Diaries of the Royal Secretariat is not something you can easily come across.

512
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,510
How could I have memorized it if I had not seen it?

513
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,240
Could there be a way?

514
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,200
Are you not close with Juseo Oh from the Royal Secretariat?

515
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,090
   

516
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:39,520
His father reported about the officials coming to Jo family of Seongju's house

517
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,900
in order to get promoted and got fired.

518
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,230
And he ended up passing after roaming around the border.

519
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,340
He must have also been resentful of Jo family of Seongju for a long time.

520
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,880
If you tell him that you want to look into what happened in Byeokcheon 10 years ago,

521
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,550
he will understand where I am coming from.

522
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,770
I understand, Your Highness. I will meet with Juseo Oh.

523
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,570
   

524
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,790
   

525
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,650
Juseo Oh is on night duty tomorrow.

526
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,820
Let His Highness know that he has to return it before that.

527
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,670
Yes, Sir.

528
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,360
Your Majesty, since Left State Minister's innocence was proven,

529
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,320
we must find out who burnt the plum tree in the palace.

530
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,200
The head shaman mentioned the Song family before she died.

531
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,310
No one but the bastards of Byeokcheon would insult the royal family and the country

532
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,750
by mentioning the ghosts of the Song family.

533
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,090
Your Majesty, if there are remaining bandits of Byeokcheon from 10 years ago,

534
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:33,750
should we not make Right State Minister take responsibility for not uprooting them completely?

535
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,000
Left State Minister, how could you say such a thing?

536
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,140
He carried out His Majesty's order

537
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,210
and punished the traitors by risking his life.

538
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,980
This is an insult toward His Majesty for giving him the meritorious subject status.

539
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,170
My goodness.

540
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,780
"May 15th.

541
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,700
Jo Won Bo, the Minister of War, notified the Office of Border Defense

542
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,850
that in Byeokcheon, Pyongan Province, an army of bandits is recruiting strong young men to start a rebellion

543
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:12,700
and the prefectures in Pyongan are noisy."

544
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,350
   

545
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,120
Don't kill me!

546
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,460
Don't kill me!

547
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,420
 The ringleader was a blacksmith of the Song family from Byeokcheon. 

548
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,240
 About 40 bandits, including him as the leader 

549
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,350
 barged into a government office in Byeokcheon, 

550
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:39,080
 attacked the soldiers, including the petty officials. 

551
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,320
 They removed everyone from the East building, 

552
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,260
 and they took over their office. 

553
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,470
 Afterward, they stole the grains and weapons 

554
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,540
 and they made themselves more powerful 

555
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,890
 by releasing the prisoners as well. 

556
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,010
 They assaulted every woman they saw 

557
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,210
 and they did not hesitate to kill whoever fought back. 

558
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,900
 Jo Won Oh, the governor of Byeokcheon 

559
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,350
 was wrapped with a straw mat and abandoned 11 km outside of Byeokcheon. 

560
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:42,350
Your Majesty, please install a temporary office and reinvestigate the Byeokcheon case from 10 years ago.

561
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:46,220
You must overturn the case!

562
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,050
If the truth is different from what the Diaries of the Royal Secretariat says,

563
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:54,260
you must strip the status of Jo Won Bo, the Prince of the Court of Seongju's as meritorious subject,

564
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,540
and take away the land he was awarded!

565
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,660
O-Overturn?

566
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,790
Reinvestigation?

567
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,840
Your Majesty, I am the living evidence!

568
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,280
On my stomach,

569
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,770
there is still a scar from the man of the Song family's sickle. It is still here!

570
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,880
"Jo Won Oh, the governor of Byeokcheon, was able to report this to the Myeongju Province Office

571
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,650
after walking 40 km to get to Myeongju."

572
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,670
 If I could not survive after getting cut by the sickle of the man of the Song family, 

573
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,100
 if I were not able to report to the governor of Myeongju 

574
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,400
by walking 40 km covered in blood,

575
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,210
those evil men would have conquered Byeokcheon and its surrounding areas.

576
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,390
They could have easily come to Hanyang as well!

577
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,040
Your Majesty, they are the remaining army of bandits

578
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,770
and they committed treason by starting their own country.

579
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,870
- Overturning would be impossible. 
 - Your Majesty!

580
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,590
Please reconsider and correct things!

581
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,390
Your Majesty, please remember why you

582
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,290
gave me Byeongbu 10 years ago.

583
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,540
Minister of War.

584
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,620
Go to Byeokcheon immediately and find out if Jo Won Oh's report was true.

585
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,640
What should I do if his report was truthful, Your Majesty?

586
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,850
Should I send a messenger and get another order from you?

587
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,570
If his report were true, it would be an emergency situation.

588
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,010
Things might get more serious if we delay, Your Majesty.

589
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,430
If his report were really true,

590
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,810
we must subdue them.

591
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,810
If so...

592
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,050
will you give me the Byeongbu?

593
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,420
   

594
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,770
I will... carry out your order!

595
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,200
I, Jo Won Bo, the newly appointed Minister of War will carry out your order

596
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,490
and make sure to defeat the evil bandits of Byeokcheon,

597
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,310
who are causing havoc in this country!

598
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,110
 "June 1st. 

599
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,680
 His Majesty appointed Jo Won Bo, the Minister of War, 

600
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,400
 as the Emergency Military Officer of Pyongan Province. 

601
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,170
 He had him figure out the whole story of the rebellion on Byeokcheon 

602
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,020
 and annihilate the army of bandits with military force." 

603
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,770
 When I arrived in Byeokcheon, 

604
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,530
 around 300 residential houses were already burning. 

605
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,080
 The already took over the five provinces in the area 

606
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,950
and those evil bandits

607
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,770
were already starting a new country.

608
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,580
Defeat the traitors!

609
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,030
You cannot let go of even one!

610
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,670
They are the traitors who are destroying the country!

611
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,030
Shoot him!

612
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,480
Kill them!

613
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,510
 "Jo Won Bo, the Minister of War/Emergency Military Officer of Pyongan Province 

614
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,570
 subjugated the enemy force in Byeokcheon and returned with cheering for victory. 

615
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,470
 It was just within a month since the Office of Border Defense was reported. 

616
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,510
 Song, the ringleader of the rebellion 

617
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:07,980
 was ordered to be tied on a post alive by the King and died after 10 days. 

618
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:19,990
To subjugate the rebellion of Byeokcheon, His Majesty promoted the Minister of War, Jo Won Bo

619
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:25,140
as the Prince of the Court of Seongju, and gave him the meritorious subject status

620
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,660
as well as 1.2 square kilometers of land and 15 slaves as a reward.

621
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,830
 The source of the rebellion, Byeokcheon, was ordered to be burnt across 8 km 

622
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:41,020
 and demoted as the traitors' land, and blocked with all of the paths to prevent future invasions." 

623
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,210
This is the official record regarding Byeokcheon and the army of bandits of the Song family.

624
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:52,890
Your Highness, all the cases are pointing toward Byeokcheon.

625
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,260
   

626
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,380
   

627
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,040
 

628
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,720
 

629
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,750
   

630
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,410
   

631
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,430
   

632
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,260
   

633
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,370
   

634
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,220
   

635
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:14,590
- What is wrong? 
 - Oh Man Shik of Department of Taoism.

636
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,140
The one who damaged the celebratory message at the hunting grounds was also from Byeokcheon.

637
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,310
How about the head shaman of the Shamanist Bureau?

638
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,260
   

639
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,450
   

640
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,010
   

641
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,140
Was the head shaman also from Byeokcheon?

642
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,730
There are things you need to do from now on.

643
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:49,420
We do not know what was found.

644
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,130
You are...

645
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:06,100
I could not think of it then, but I suddenly remembered something.

646
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,790
I thought it might be helpful to you.

647
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,000
Yes. What is it?

648
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,150
I am not sure if it is related to the head shaman's murders,

649
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,090
but around that time, a woman frequented the Shamanist Bureau.

650
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,020
A woman?

651
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,350
Did you see her face?

652
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,770
 I could not see her face because she was wearing a veil. 

653
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:41,490
 I think she visited whenever the head shaman came back from the temple in Gaeseong. 

654
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,140
Did you say it was a woman?

655
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,040
There must have been a woman who ran errands for them.

656
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,720
 If there are remaining rebels, we can just find them and kill them! 

657
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,170
The case closed then. What is the point of going back to that now?

658
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,210
Is he trying to take back the land

659
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,810
he gave you as a reward now?

660
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,930
It cannot be a woman from the palace, can it?

661
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
How is the Grand Prince feeling?

662
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,170
He could not sleep, but he took medicine from the royal physician and he fell asleep just now.

663
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,380
and he fell asleep just now.

664
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,930
I told them to give you a word when he awakes.

665
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,130
 Your Highness, you must become the Queen Mother. 

666
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,840
 Become Royal Queen Dowager, and then the Grand Royal Queen Dowager. 

667
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,450
 Become the highest-ranking and most powerful woman in Joseon. 

668
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:08,860
 I will make sure to put you in that position. 

669
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,020
Your Highness, what are you thinking about?

670
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,530
You smiled just now.

671
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,660
Did I? I smiled without realizing it.

672
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,890
Look at those carp.

673
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,720
- They are just common carp.
 - They are not.

674
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,250
When Her Highness moved to the palace 10 years ago,

675
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,350
His Majesty was concerned about her feeling lonely.

676
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,600
So he put these carp in there for her.

677
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,160
The palace was so big and lonely then.

678
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,980
I used to come here often and cry alone.

679
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,680
His Majesty saw that

680
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,220
and asked me why I was staring at the water with nothing in it.

681
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,510
So he ordered to put carps in it.

682
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,660
That is why I smiled.

683
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:04,320
Do you not find His Majesty's heart

684
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,270
so sweet?

685
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,770
It is so picturesque, is it not?

686
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:31,580
How did our family end up producing such a beautiful woman?

687
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,940
Also, when you defeated the enemy and made a glorious return,

688
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:41,970
our niece caught the King's eyes. What a coincidence that was.

689
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:48,170
That must mean our family was graced with Heaven's fortune.

690
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,190
 Uncle. 

691
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,730
 Are you trying to become the King above the King after putting Myeong Ahn on the throne? 

692
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,530
 That will never happen. 

693
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,540
 I wonder... 

694
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,500
 if you will be alive by then. 

695
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,410
 I would be hearing about your death by then. 

696
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,180
   

697
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:30,250
Please thank Juseo Oh for me.

698
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:33,210
You had better take a good look before you return it as well.

699
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,710
Yes, Your Highness.

700
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,370
Also, we must find Oh Man Shik of the Department of Taoism.

701
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,950
He has something to do with the head shaman, too.

702
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:46,170
Make sure to keep him alive and bring him in front of me.

703
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:03,610
 I will uproot all of you completely and tear you into tiny little pieces! 

704
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,230
 Their souls will roam 

705
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,450
 in purgatory with no place to go! 

706
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:31,480
Your Highness! What is wrong?

707
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,230
Turn the light on! I cannot sleep because I am scared!

708
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,650
Yes.

709
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,020
We were on our way to the Grand Prince after hearing the news. What is going on?

710
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:55,050
The Grand Prince asked us to turn the lights on because he got scared.

711
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,940
That is okay.

712
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,010
All of you can leave.

713
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,650
Bring more lights! Make it brighter!

714
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,050
What is wrong?

715
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,560
Did you have a nightmare?

716
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,760
Mother, a snake...

717
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,530
They sent a snake to get me killed. It was Song!

718
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:39,580
The ringleader, Song of Byeokcheon, will send a snake to kill me!

719
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,550
He will kill me with a snake just like how he killed the head shaman!

720
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,000
Mother, please call Grandfather.

721
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,250
Ask him to defeat his ghost, just like how he defeated the evil bandits!

722
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:56,930
I find snakes and Song so scary and repulsive!

723
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,920
She said the Song family would destroy the Yi family.

724
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,290
No! No! That is not true!

725
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:05,030
That thief will send a snake again.

726
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:09,200
- He will come to kill me because I am of the Yi family.
 - I told you, he will not!

727
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,870
How come you do not listen to your mother?

728
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,580
Song was...

729
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,030
He was...

730
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,740
not like that.

731
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,890
Mother.

732
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,850
He...

733
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,380
He will never kill you.

734
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,400
He...

735
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,670
was not the ringleader of the bandits.

736
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,120
Mother knows.

737
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,180
He will never kill you

738
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,210
nor send you a snake.

739
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,580
It is just a dream.

740
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,360
Do you understand?

741
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,140
Mother,

742
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,800
how do you know Song?

743
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,930
Your Highness, Eunuch Kang of the Department of Hawks is here.

744
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,640
 Let him in. 

745
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,480
Your Highness, you wanted to see me.

746
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,780
I called you because I have a question for you.

747
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,480
Please ask me.

748
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,990
Your hometown is... Byeokcheon, as I hear.

749
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,990
I called you because I need to find out something about Byeokcheon.

750
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,630
 The Crown Prince is calling people from Byeokcheon to the Eastern Palace. 

751
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,280
   

752
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:16,390


753
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,820
   

754
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:27,340
 Rumor says the Crown Prince is bringing eunuchs and court ladies from Byeokcheon into the Eastern Palace. 

755
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,560
 Your Highness, what are you trying to find out? 

756
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,100
 Is it not strange? 

757
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,920
 If it were really true. 

758
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,080
 I cannot believe the Crown Prince is protecting the bandits who brought chaos to the country. 

759
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,790
 What should we do about this? 

760
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,560
 Did you really not see it? 

761
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,320
 Your Highness! 

762
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:51,250
 Open the door right now!
