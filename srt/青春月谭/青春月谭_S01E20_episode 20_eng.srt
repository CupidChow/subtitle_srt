1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,520
   

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,440
   

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,210
   

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,550
   

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,410
   

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,010
   

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,990
   

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,830
   

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,330
   

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,260
H-Hyungnim, what is the matter?

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,940
That wench...

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,680
She planned this all along.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,630
    
 What is your name?

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,200
- My name is Yeon Hee. 
 - Oh, Yeon Hee...

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,850
- What is your name? 
 - It is Yeon Hee.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,300
Raise your head.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,710
Tonight, would you be willing to change your fate?

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,550
While I saw you entering earlier,

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,310
I thought it would be a waste for someone with your face to remain a lowly courtesan.

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,380
Do you know who is coming to this house tonight?

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,080
The King himself will visit

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,850
the house of Jo Won Bo in Buwon-gun of Seongju.

23
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,300
 It's a place where I am inviting the revered King, 

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,200
 so I cannot have a lowly courtesan enter his presence. 

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,150
 Thus... 

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,640
 I will... 

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,950
 introduce you as a daughter of our family line. 

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,350
From now on, you are a daughter of the Jo family of Seongju,

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,640
Soo Young.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,780
Inside my womb...

31
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,270
I am carrying the King's child.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,380
That wench...

33
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,520
That wench dared to...

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,400
You...

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,750
You wench!

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,750
Damn...

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,290
Damn it!

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,270
What do you think it is?

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,540
Is it not the egg of an animal?

40
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,400
It looks like the egg of a fish.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,570
What are you doing?

42
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,500
If it's from the Queen, we need it as evidence-

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,010
Forgive me for my rudeness, Your Highness.

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,000
This is the egg of a fish called Mooyyanghyeolmok.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,040
- Mooyyanghyeolmok... 
 - It is a fish from Byeokcheon.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,970
Some adults prayed to that fish, saying it lived for a thousand years.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,980
There were strange stories about that fish.

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,580
One was that the fish ate human blood,

49
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,930
and another was if anyone eats that fish's eggs

50
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,670
would go mad.

51
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,460
Then, to fulfill the ghost's letter that they sent to you...

52
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,190
 You will wander through all the land mad, 

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,480
 and disappear alone while lost in a confusing world. 

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,330
It's such a relief that we were able to stop it before anything happened.

55
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,910
That fish is still alive.

56
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,770
When I stopped by the Queen's Palace not too long ago, I saw that redfish there.

57
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,870
Welcome.

58
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,590
- What is this, Uncle? 
 - Tell me.

59
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,600
How is it that your name is in the letter of complaint written by the Byeokcheon people?

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,650
Ten years ago, that day... did you come to kill me?

61
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,040
 That is right. I had gone there to kill you. 

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,210
You deserve to die in the worst way possible.

63
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,930
So I had gone to end your life in front of the King.

64
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,090
However...

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,950
I suppose you needed to save Song's child that was in your womb?

66
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,740
Don't you dare speak of the Grand Prince with your dirty lips!

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,810
Did you plan to expose what happened in Byeokcheon

68
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,820
after the Grand Prince rose to the throne?

69
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,940
You cannot stop me.

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,330
If the King finds out about all of this,

71
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,140
the Grand Prince will not be able to retain his life.

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,910
Will you tell the King that you deceitfully offered up to the King, a lowly courtesan,

73
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,860
and a woman of the Song family

74
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,190
as a daughter of the Jo family of Seongju?

75
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,840
Also, once the King finds out the wicked things you have done

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,810
to the people of Byeokcheon ten years ago,

77
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,180
you will not be able to retain your life as well.

78
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,640
Until the Grand Prince rises to the throne,

79
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,900
you also cannot reveal what happened in Byeokcheon.

80
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,970
You cannot have the Grand Prince rise to the throne as a son of Song.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,740
I know where the people of Byeokcheon are living together.

82
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,400
They are at Naean Village in Mt. Songak.

83
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,210
I will catch and kill them all.

84
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,330
Just like ten years ago,

85
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,940
once I come back after shutting up those animals,

86
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,090
I will consider what I should do about you and that child of Song.

87
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,310
Before you do that, I will end your life!

88
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,740
You!

89
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,670
Court Lady Kwon, Court Lady Kwon!

90
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,260
Do you think I let Court Lady Kwon alone?

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,410
She deceived me all these years

92
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,260
 and had delivered my words to you... 

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,380
I am not the only one who found out about Naean Village.

94
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,260
Since the deposed Crown Prince went to Naean Village, I cannot let him live.

95
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,870
If the deposed Crown Prince comes back to the Palace alive,

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,870
not only would you and the Grand Prince's life be at risk,

97
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,410
it would be difficult to retain my own life.

98
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,770
You know what this uncle has desired for so long.

99
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,020
It does not matter if it is the child of Song.

100
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,750
The Grand Prince must become the Foundation of the Nation

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,100
and rise to the throne.

102
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,880
You must become the Queen Mother and the Great Queen Dowager.

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
That is how...

104
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
I would become the king who is above the king.

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:12,000


106
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,060
It was true what the Governor of Gaeseong wrote in his coded message.

107
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,140
This is an anonymous letter that the Queen gave to my son.

108
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,140
   

109
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,820
Also, this is a treaty document that my son received from the Right State Minister.

110
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,950
It is corroborative evidence of Right State Minister Jo Won Bo

111
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,200
asked the Sergeant to assassinate the Crown Prince.

112
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,350
 I, Jo Won Bo of Buwon-gun in Seongju, promise the Sergeant Han Seong On 

113
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,250
 the reinstatement of Left State Minister Han Joong Eon in return for 

114
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,990
 killing the deposed Crown Prince Yi Hwan and eliminating future trouble. 

115
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,130
Immediately go out and gather useful people.

116
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,460
Anyone who is good with a bow and sword.

117
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,590
Anyone who does not hesitate to slaughter an animal that gets in the way.

118
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,380
I will capture all those lowly creatures

119
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,780
- and butcher them! 
  - Yes! 

120
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,620
Jo Dae Cheon and Jo Jeong Soo, who went out with me to Byeokcheon ten years ago

121
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,270
will be at the Capital Defense Unit and the Royal Defense Unit.

122
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,380
Go and tell them that I am looking for them.

123
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,040
Yes, Sir.

124
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,930
Since we are doing this without the King's command,

125
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,910
they will have to put their life on the line.

126
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,770
Tell them I will compensate them generously.

127
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,080
- Your Highness... 
 - Do not speak.

128
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,690
Your Highness, you must not abandon your people.

129
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,640
You must not abandon them.

130
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,570
Hyun...

131
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,660
My Hyun... is in the hand of that man Jo Won Bo...

132
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,470
You must stop the Right State Minister.

133
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,030
Do not become like him.

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,190
We came so far away...

135
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,710
that it is too late...

136
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,170
to go back to our hometown.

137
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,810
Court Lady Kwon...

138
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,650
Court Lady Kwon!

139
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,430
Court Lady Kwon...

140
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,650
Court Lady Kwon...

141
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,940
There was so much water in Byeokcheon that all you had to do was dig for a well.

142
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,330
I know.

143
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,420
But the people of Naean Village lived like this for ten years.

144
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,080
It's the pretty scholars!

145
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,580
They must have seen the pinwheel letter.

146
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,540
Hey, hurry! Come over here!

147
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,190
Seeing the traces of people, we must almost be at Naean Village.

148
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,160
Your Highness, how about we wait until the full moon, as Tae Kang's twin said?

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,200
There are still three days left before the full moon.

150
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,150
How could we wait until then?

151
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,350
Every second is important right now.

152
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,080
Stop! Who are you lot?

153
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,530
Have you betrayed your hometown people?

154
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,280
You are putting your hometown people in danger in the end!

155
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,320
Hyungnim, you are trying to do it your way,

156
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,650
and I am trying to do it my way to protect our hometown people.

157
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
Throw away your swords.

158
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,350
I cannot do that.

159
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,190
Make them throw their swords away first.

160
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,020
It is my command.

161
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,250
Throw away your swords.

162
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,270
I came to save you all.

163
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,120
I know you are not bandits

164
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,070
and you are not rebels who set up a new country.

165
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,470
I am...

166
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,800
the Crown Prince of Joseon.

167
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,730
You should speak more accurately.

168
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,810
You are not the Crown Prince but a deposed Crown Prince.

169
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,560
- Crown Prince? 
 - You've already been deposed.

170
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,400
Take them away.

171
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,870
What do you mean by that?

172
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,910
A pinwheel letter?

173
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,700
Besides that, what does it mean that the tall, handsome scholar was the Crown Prince?

174
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,040
An invader has appeared!

175
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,970
An invader has appeared!

176
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,460
Wait, he is...

177
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,720
 Although Byeokcheon is my hometown, I know nothing about that place. 

178
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,280
Your Highness.

179
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,940
Put down your sickles and hoes. He is the Crown Prince.

180
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,530
- How could the Crown Prince... 
 - They are invaders.

181
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,060
We cannot let anyone who knows about Naean Village live.

182
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,630
We will not let a single person survive.

183
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,410
Before the rooster crows in the morning, we will cut their throats.

184
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,670
Stop!

185
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,650
Stop right there!

186
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,290
They walked in on their own accord.

187
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,720
I am sure they did not come to harm us. They even threw away their swords.

188
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,560
That is right. We saw them throw away their swords.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,680
I heard him saying in the mountain that they came to save us.

190
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,220
For the people of Byeokcheon to go home, that man must disappear.

191
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,620
That man must disappear, and a new Crown Prince must rise to the throne

192
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,770
for the people of Byeokcheon to return home.

193
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,400
I came to hear the stories of injustice you faced.

194
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,810
Please tell me what happened ten years ago in Byeokcheon.

195
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,050
If we tell you, will you believe us?

196
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,840
I know you were not bandits.

197
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,240
I also know that you are not rebels.

198
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

199
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,410
I used to work in the palace.

200
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,140
Let us at least have a conversation. While I was a eunuch,

201
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,030
the Crown Prince brought in Byeokcheon people to find out about what happened ten years ago.

202
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,780
That is true. I heard he opposed the King when we got kicked out.

203
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,090
However, did he not kick you out in the end?

204
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,670
But he still did not discriminate against and hate us for coming from Byeokcheon.

205
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,950
That is right. He knew we were orphans from Byeokcheon,

206
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,370
and yet he paid for my sister's medicine and gave us money.

207
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,170
If it were not for him, we would already be dead.

208
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,930
If you will confine them, then cut their throats in the morning,

209
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,320
at least let us hear why they came here.

210
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,410
If they really did not come to save us, we can cut their throats then!

211
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,230
Since we already took away their swords, we have numbers on our side.

212
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,650
Then let us do that.

213
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,370
There is no way your twin, Kang, would have come to harm us.

214
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,490
Please untie us. We will not run away.

215
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,370
Thank you.

216
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,400
Much better...

217
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,860
Now, please lay down your hoes and sickles.

218
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,910
His Highness came to reveal what really happened ten years ago

219
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,630
and give you what you all want.

220
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,910
Please tell me. I will believe you.

221
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,290
Do you really know...

222
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,720
that we are not bandits?

223
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,060
- I know it. 
 - That is right!

224
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,300
We were not thieves.

225
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,740
We just wanted to live as people of Joseon.

226
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,580
All we wanted to do was

227
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,590
 to ask the King for help by writing a letter of complaint. 

228
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,530
I got a sheet of paper weather stripping from the courtesan house.

229
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,110
I borrowed this from a neighboring village school.

230
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,660
If we write a letter of complaint and take it to the King,

231
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,820
will he really listen to our plea?

232
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,970
It has been so long since I wrote letters.

233
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,870
You are the only person who knows how to write, Oh Wol's Father.

234
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,520
Please ask that they not demand military exemption tax for my dead husband.

235
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,750
I am a criminal for giving birth to a son.

236
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,130
How could I have this baby serve in the military?

237
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,670
Not only that, they confiscated all the deeds to our houses and land.

238
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,420
Gosh, they even took away our cauldron!

239
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,170
The people are abandoning their children or running away to survive.

240
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,310
How could you not run away? If you do not pay, it means 50 beatings.

241
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,500
How could anyone live like a person after all that beating?

242
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,010
Did you not see Sam Shik's father walk with a limp?

243
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,560
Supposedly, the King is the parent of the people.

244
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,090
How could a parent turn a blind eye when his children are like this?

245
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,450
Now everyone should write their names here.

246
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,260
 My name? 

247
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
Who knows what will happen to us?

248
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,410
- I just remembered something urgent. 
 - Look.

249
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,670
It is time for me to breastfeed Soon.

250
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,270
I mean, my Soon...

251
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,890
Is it all right, even if it is the name of a butcher?

252
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,750
If it is all right to put a girl's name, put my name down, too.

253
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,780
My name is...

254
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,960
Yeon Hee.

255
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,100
You should write it in Chinese characters, but formalities are not important right now.

256
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
My name is Ssang Gae.

257
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Ssang Gae, who here does not know your name?

258
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,580
- My name is Jo Sang Won. 
 - Put my name down, too. It is Seok Gap.

259
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,830
My name is Deok Shim.

260
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,110
Even if they take me away, please raise our Dal Rae and Meo Roo well.

261
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,750
   

262
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,700
I was getting medicinal herbs...

263
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,250
Thirty-eight!

264
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,630
Thirty-nine!

265
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,090
Forty!

266
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,220
Du Guk Byung Min!

267
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,860
Look.

268
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,990
Du for eating away.

269
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,620
Are you trying to say that I am a bug?

270
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,790
How dare you, you lowly scum!

271
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,210
You are less than dogs and pigs, yet I considered you people of Joseon.

272
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,810
I made you participate in the military and labor for the nation

273
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,490
so you can participate in all the duties of a people.

274
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,020
And now you are saying that I, your governor,

275
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,960
did wrong?

276
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,370
You bastards really want to die...

277
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,200
Are you sure you brought in all the bastards who signed this?

278
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,450
Does it not say that Hong Je Yong makes the plea?

279
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,170
I am Hong Je Yong. I am the one who spearheaded this,

280
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,610
so just kill me!

281
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,930
He asks to be killed! Beat him!

282
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,360
Hurry up and beat him. Hurry up and beat him!

283
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,370
- Forty-one! 
 - Harder!

284
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,080
Forty-two!

285
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
   

286
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,400
Please deliver this to His Majesty.

287
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,790
If you do, the Crown Prince will be able to return.

288
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,350
What is this?

289
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,420
Princess,

290
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,620
please take good care of the Grand Prince.

291
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,120
You will not be able to protect the Grand Prince,

292
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,110
but the only person I can ask is you, Princess.

293
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,170
Why are you saying such things all of a sudden?

294
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,320
 Hyun, your father was innocent. 

295
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,180
 All your father did was open the doors 

296
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,020
 of the forge. 

297
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,420
 Your father was not the leader of a group of bandits. 

298
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,670
 There was no such thing as a leader among us. 

299
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,000
Look, Soo Cheon, are you just going to stand around and watch?

300
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,900
Let us just rescue the people.

301
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,760
How could we watch while our village people are dying in there?

302
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,980
The people who are in the jails are dying.

303
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,960
They may even already be dead. Please...

304
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,740
What is this?

305
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,140
 By the time the people went to the government office, no one was there. 

306
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,430
 Those wicked men had already fled when they heard we were coming. 

307
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,930
Oh Wol's Father!

308
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,500
Gosh... Oh, no...

309
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,760
Aigoo...

310
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,350
That is the seal of the government office.

311
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,950
It would be best to leave this behind.

312
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,170
The one who fled, leaving the people behind, was that bastard, Jo Won Oh.

313
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,500
How could we slash someone who had already fled?

314
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,310
 He himself stabbed his own stomach. 

315
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,560
Open the door, open the door!

316
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,610
There are rebels!

317
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,220
We waited with white flags raised up.

318
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,870
We believed that if we put up white flags, the people who come from the court

319
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,390
would know that we did not do anything.

320
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,810
Everyone, get to cover!

321
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,540
Hurry, run!

322
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,620
Hurry up and go!

323
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,880
Hurry!

324
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,780
- No, do not go! 
 - We must go!

325
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,410
They are bandits who invaded the government office, wielding sickles and hoes.

326
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,500
Did you think you could avoid punishment by putting up white flags like this?

327
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,840
He must be the leader. Did you say that he is a blacksmith named Song?

328
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,330
He set fire to the whole village and cut down anyone they came across.

329
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,400
Whether they were elderly or young, they did not discriminate. They...

330
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,780
just killed anyone they caught.

331
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,270
My daughter died then as well.

332
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,140
Since you are the Crown Prince, answer me.

333
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,670
If she was a bandit, what would she have stolen?

334
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,830
As a five-year-old child who was so small

335
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,600
because she did not even have a millet porridge to eat,

336
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,310
what wrong could she have done?

337
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,220
We should have buried this with her...

338
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,670
She would need this to fall asleep.

339
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,840
We should go.

340
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,600
We have a long way to go.

341
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,590
We will return soon, Oh Wol.

342
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,790
Even though you miss your mommy, just hold it in for a little bit, okay?

343
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,920
Oh Wol...

344
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,810
All of this was my fault.

345
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,810
I will pay for this crime for the rest of my life,

346
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,450
so everyone,

347
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,700
please go far away

348
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,970
and go on forgetting all of this.

349
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,780
Forget?

350
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,880
How could we forget this?

351
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,700
Do not say stuff like that to us, Monk.

352
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,450
I will get revenge on the ones who did this to us!

353
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,460
Oh Wol...

354
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,750
Oh Wol...

355
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,590
How would you help us now with our situation after all these years?

356
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,360
How can you relieve the feelings of anguish and sorrow that we have stored up for ten years!

357
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,630
There is no way to repay you for the past ten years of suffering.

358
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,860
But I will make sure to send you all back to your hometown.

359
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,530
Do you mean that? Will you really send us back to our hometown?

360
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,880
I am the Guardian Warrior of the Royal Bodyguard Unit. I will protect you on your journey back to your hometown.

361
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,820
And I am the Sergeant Han Seong On.

362
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,750
I will go with you as the governor of Byeokcheon.

363
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,950
All of this has been granted to you by the King.

364
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,300
I will reinvestigate what happened ten years ago in Byeokcheon

365
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,430
and punish the crimes of Right State Minister Jo Won Bo and Minister of Justice Jon Won Oh, who fabricated everything.

366
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,760
At the same time, if you return with me to Byeokcheon,

367
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,060
I will request five years of tax exemption.

368
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,680
Even after five years, inspectors will be sent out periodically

369
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,590
to watch the activities of the new governor of Byeokcheon.

370
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,250
Then, how about the ban on Byeokcheon people from taking state exams?

371
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,860
The ban on taking state exams for them will be repealed,

372
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,660
so government workers who were unjustly kicked out will be brought back.

373
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,890
Also, I will set up a special state exam for Byeokcheon and select talented people from that region.

374
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,260
I will make it so that no one will ever be discriminated against

375
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,300
just because they were from Byeokcheon.

376
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,880
All of this is my will as the Crown Prince of Joseon,

377
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,610
and the King's will.

378
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,490
The fact that I still hold this identity tag of the Crown Prince

379
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,230
shows that I still have authority as the Foundation of this Nation,

380
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,100
and the fact that the position of the Crown Prince is still vacant

381
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,240
shows that I will return to my position as the only Crown Prince of this nation.

382
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,580
Thus, please believe me.

383
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,430
I will make sure

384
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,940
to save you.

385
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Well, since His Highness and the future governor of Byeokcheon said their piece,

386
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,980
I, too, have something to say.

387
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,280
Are we not going to eat?

388
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,470
I mean, it is already time to eat.

389
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,110
Gosh!

390
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,770
If you will cut our throats tomorrow, let us eat before we die, at least.

391
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,680
I heard the people of Byeokcheon were so hospitable.

392
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,320
- So please share some food with us! 
 - Please share some food with us!

393
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,230
- Gosh... 
 - Don't be like that.

394
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,700
Let us eat first!

395
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,500
Gosh, seriously.

396
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,550
If we eat, things will be better.

397
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,670
As you have ordered, the soldiers are ready.

398
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,990
They will risk their lives at your command, just like ten years ago.

399
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,980
   

400
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,580
Your Majesty, it appears the Right State Minister is gathering his own soldiers.

401
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,610
I believe the time you had mentioned has come, Your Majesty.

402
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,460
I will go to the Left State Minister with the milbu* and milji*.
(Milbu: A badge to approve a military action / Milji: Secret order)

403
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,630
 No, Your Highness. 

404
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,700
 The King has commanded us not to let anyone inside. 

405
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,880
 What is going on outside? 

406
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
 The Princess requests to see you and refuses to leave. 

407
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,550
Father, I have something to give you.

408
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,180
You must see it right now.

409
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,820
Come in.

410
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
Is this not the...

411
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,180
letter of complaint by the people of Byeokcheon?

412
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,360
It is clear that this is a map that leads to Naean Village!

413
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,820
Did the Queen really give you this?

414
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,130
 The King is here. 

415
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,930
Queen!

416
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,050
What did you drink? Is it poison?

417
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,010
I will...

418
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,000
receive my punishment

419
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,180
by wandering the earth.

420
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
 First, eat up. 

421
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,800
So, you would farm together and eat meals together as well?

422
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,110
I feel like it tastes better eating together like this.

423
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,240
But what is with all that dirt...

424
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,750
Are there no wells here?

425
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,720
I saw water buckets. Are you traveling far away to bring back water?

426
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,410
There is no water in this area, no matter how much you dig, I see.

427
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:07,970
How did you manage to live here all this time without water?

428
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,060
All right. I made some red bean porridge.

429
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,670
Gosh, how did you know my bowl was empty?

430
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,650
Thank you.

431
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,090
Well, did His Highness go somewhere?

432
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,090
He was here just a moment ago. Where did he go?

433
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,410
He probably went to the outhouse or something.

434
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,180
What is the matter?

435
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,860
Where is the Crown Prince?

436
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,680
- Crown Prince ran away! 
 - No.

437
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,290
Oh, no.

438
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,130
Crown Prince did not run away.

439
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,120
I just went to pick up this shovel.

440
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,930
I am thinking of doing some shoveling.

441
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,820
Why would you shovel all of a sudden-

442
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,780
I know a thing or two about shoveling. So...

443
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,560
I am thinking of digging a well.

444
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,390
Try digging for a hundred days and see if you get a single drop of water.

445
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,740
He probably never shoveled before.

446
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,970
Who do you think taught him?

447
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,730
Come on. His Highness is shoveling.

448
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,120
How come you are just watching?

449
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,720
The impressive people can shovel.

450
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,650
I, Myung Jin, will have red bean porridge-

451
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,370
Should I dig, too?

452
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,080
I will show you how shoveling is done, then!

453
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,320
Move!

454
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,490
I cannot waste any more time. Move quickly.

455
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,990
Search everywhere! We must find them!

456
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,510
 Yes! 

457
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,370
Move quickly!

458
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,910
Gosh! I do not want to do it. But I have to.

459
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,470
Would you like to switch with me?

460
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,340
You should stay put. This is your master's specialty.

461
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,810
You improved a lot.

462
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,930
My friend is doing it. Then I should, too.

463
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,960
- A lot more. 
 - Okay!

464
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,320
Not yet, one more time.

465
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,010
Move it!

466
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,550
We did not get any water for 10 years. Digging now will not do anything.

467
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,100
Please stop.

468
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:51,670
I could not do anything for you, but I could at least let you drink water.

469
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,610
I will do as much as I can.

470
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,930
Your Highness, stop! You might pass out at this rate!

471
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,890
Your Highness, you should try to renegotiate instead.

472
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,800
No matter how many promises I make, I would not be able to change their minds.

473
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,970
To change their minds, I need to prove my intention first.

474
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,130
So i just need to keep trying until water comes out.

475
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,040
You are right. You show your heart with your actions,

476
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,750
not with words.

477
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,010
Your Highness!

478
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,790
You have to chop up that big clump first. You cannot just keep digging.

479
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,400
You will end up hurting yourself.

480
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,510
We will finish the rest. You should stop now.

481
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,380
Everyone, come over here!

482
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,540
Yes, we should do it.

483
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,770
Here.

484
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,320
Move quickly!

485
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,120
Let's go.

486
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,580
That is the kind of person he is. Maybe we should trust him.

487
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,450
We are invaded!

488
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,190
Did you think I could not find you if you hid like little mice?

489
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:52,480
Right State Minister! Did you bring an army without the King's order?

490
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,950
Well, look who is here! It is the deposed Crown Prince.

491
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,840
I was very worried because I heard you had disappeared on the way to Ganghwa Island.

492
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,600
What are you doing here with these bandits?

493
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,540
Are you not the bandit yourself?

494
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,510
You slaughtered powerless people because you were blinded by authority.

495
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,690
You became a fake meritorious subject by framing the people as traitors.

496
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,260
I came here to prove all of your sins.

497
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,170
You committed a lot of sins. You committed murder by slaughtering innocent people.

498
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,810
You lied to the Royal Court and the people for personal interest.

499
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,160
You instigated the murder of the Crown Prince, and you are breaking the law by using the army

500
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,390
and trying to kill the people of this country again, which is treason.

501
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,030
You will not be able to pay for your sins by just dying.

502
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,580
So what do you want me to do?

503
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,980
All of you will die here today, anyway.

504
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,560
Who will be able to talk about what happened here?

505
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,500
Do you think things will go the way you want?

506
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,300
The King ordered me to arrest the rebel who scorned the royalty and the nation

507
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,550
and slaughtered innocent people!

508
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,160
The King's order! It is the King's order!

509
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,210
Jo Won Bo, the ringleader of the rebels, must put the sword down!

510
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:47,450
You will be punished for your sins here today.

511
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,480
Attack!

512
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,500
Run away with the women and children.

513
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,140
Let us go this way. This way!

514
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,520
Women and children should come this way! Be careful, be careful!

515
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,230
Careful!

516
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,990
Go, go!

517
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,730
Do not let a single person from Byeokcheon live!

518
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,880
You should go without me. I need to go back.

519
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,340
What will you do?

520
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,310
Let us hide for now.

521
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,380
This way.

522
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,540
This way. Go!

523
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,300
Gosh!

524
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,340
Yi Hwan!

525
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,190
Jo Won Bo!

526
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,420
Everyone, drop the swords!

527
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,120
I will let you live if you drop the sword now!

528
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:33,040
Tie him up. We will take him to the capital and let him pay for his sins properly.

529
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,150
Your Highness!

530
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,530
Hyungnim!

531
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,320
The people of Naean Village do not know anything.

532
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,340
They did not do anything wrong.

533
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,760
They just believed that they would be sent...

534
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,600
to their hometown. So...

535
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,610
Please take them... to hometown...

536
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,430
I promise you.

537
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:29,980
Everyone here will...return to their hometown.

538
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,090
Kang.

539
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,290
When I lived as you,

540
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,270
I was able to...

541
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,170
be human and laugh a lot.

542
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,430
 His Highness told you to take your medicine. 

543
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,080
 - You can leave now— 
 - If so, I will see myself out. 

544
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,240
Hyungnim! Hyungnim! Hyungnim! No, Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

545
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,600
Hyungnim! Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

546
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,780
Hyungnim!

547
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,720
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

548
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,950
No! Hyungnim!

549
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,430
Hyungnim!

550
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,150
Hyungnim...

551
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,340
Hyungnim!

552
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,910
Hyungnim...

553
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,580
Take this traitor with you immediately!

554
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,980
Since I met you...

555
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:33,330
I was given a great deal of comfort and peace in this precarious and desolate palace.

556
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,170
I was always grateful to Grand Prince and you

557
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,630
for that reason.

558
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,540
I am no longer a courtesan who smiles for money.

559
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,390
Blacksmith Song paid the ransom money.

560
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:57,880
So... please let me go.

561
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,640
Please?

562
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,540
He is waiting for me.

563
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,030
Who are you?

564
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,860
Leave her alone.

565
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:27,750
 🌸 Thank you to our Channel Manager: sheli 🌸

568
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:44,190


569
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,660

570
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:57,470

571
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:01,040
The uprising in Byeokcheon 10 years ago was

572
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,820
an incident that was fabricated by Right State Minister

573
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,790
Jo Won Bo and Minister of Justice Jo Won Oh!

574
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,370
That is what they say!

575
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,140
The people of Byeokcheon were just innocent people

576
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,060
who were victimized by the tyranny of government officials.

577
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,430
They were neither bandits nor rebels!

578
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,920
That is what they say!

579
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,360
For finding out the truth of this case,

580
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,080
the deposed Crown Prince will be reinstated, and then...

581
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,480
become the next in line for the throne again!

582
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,150
That is what they say!

583
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,850
Right State Minister Jo Won Bo and Minister of Justice Jo Won Oh

584
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,880
- will be torn into five pieces! 
 - Of course, of course!

585
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,610
They deserve to be torn apart!

586
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,240
Die!

587
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,570
Both of you, die!

588
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:08,810
 Also, for being involved in corruption and abuse of power, 

589
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,740
 Minister of Rites Jo Ong Yoon and Minister of General Affairs 

590
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,500
 Ahn Il Nam will be stripped from their positions 

591
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,570
 and will be exiled outside the capital. 

592
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:19,950
The Queen Jo will be stripped from her position

593
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,560
and Grand Prince Myung Ahn will be removed from the palace

594
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,470
and be exiled to Pyeongan Province!

595
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,120
That is what they say!

596
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,480
Also, the king ordered the Crown Prince to manage national affairs due to his illness.

597
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,600
He also ordered him to find a way to compensate

598
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,470
the people of Byeokcheon for being persecuted and discriminated against.

599
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,890
He ordered him to work hard to

600
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,220
calm down the current state of the country!

601
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,980
That is what they say!

602
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,460
Also, while finding out about the crimes committed by the Jo family of Seongju,

603
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,800
they arrested the real culprit who murdered the governor of Gaeseong's family!

604
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,720
Therefore,

605
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,760
   

606
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,910
I announce that Min Jae Yi, the daughter of the governor of Gaeseong, is innocent

607
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,630
and the female servant Jang Ga Ram, who stood by her innocent owner

608
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,950
will be emancipated!

609
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:21,550
Goodness! That is great!

610
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,570
By the way, My Lady.

611
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,650
Can you forgive that woman?

612
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,070
She went insane and was roaming around.

613
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:54,160
I gave birth to a baby!

614
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,410
You are bringing bad luck to my first sale!

615
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,560
- Leave! Leave! 
 - Have you seen my husband?

616
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,100
Have you seen my husband?

617
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,910
Look! A crazy lady!

618
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,770
I gave birth to an impressive son!

619
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,240
How come my husband will not come?

620
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,770
My husband is a blacksmith.

621
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,800
Have you not seen him?

622
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,250
Have you seen my husband?

623
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,470
My husband is a blacksmith from the Song family.

624
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:40,850
If you see him, please tell him that I gave birth to a boy!

625
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,950
You crazy wench!

626
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,560
- How annoying! 
 - No, my baby!

627
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,310
No, my baby!

628
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,630
 She went insane and even forgot about her only son, too. 

629
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:57,190
She has already been punished for all of her sins.

630
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:01,650
But Young Master Shim Young put poison in the soup because he was hypnotized.

631
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,180
And the monk who hypnotized him died.

632
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,790
Is she not the one who was behind all this?

633
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,850
At first,

634
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:17,210
I did not understand why His Highness wanted to save the people of Byeokcheon

635
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,590
 by going to Naean Village. 

636
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:42,460
Can you... forgive them?

637
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,120
You lost your brother because of Jo Won Bo,

638
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,160
but they tried to put a curse on you and kill you.

639
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,740
Are you okay?

640
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,170
I have been worried about you.

641
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,030
I am not okay.

642
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:06,710
I found out the truth from 10 years ago by hearing their story,

643
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,460
but I lost my family because of them.

644
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,050
It is hard for me to feel compassionate toward them.

645
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,350
I understand... how you feel.

646
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,200
You understand how I feel, too.

647
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,390
But Jae Yi, where did things start going wrong?

648
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,070
Who is the one who started it?

649
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,940
They were persecuted and kicked out of their own

650
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,830
hometown, and they were homeless for ten years.

651
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:49,350
There are people who made them desire to return home and nothing else.

652
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,010
Jo Won Bo is the one who gave a peach to Grand Prince.

653
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:57,470
But how could you blame the Grand Prince for delivering the peach without knowing anything?

654
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:00,680
The truly bad people are out there.

655
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,470
A vicious circle in which people who were hurt and robbed blame each other.

656
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:09,620
That is what the bad men truly want.

657
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,810
I just want to cut that vicious circle.

658
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,930
I understand.

659
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,790
I will try to forgive them while promising myself

660
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,150
I will not be defeated by the bad men.

661
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,200
So you will not get defeated by the bad men.

662
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:54,820
   

663
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,710
Your Majesty,

664
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,760
Han Seong Ohn, the governor of Byeokcheon, sent you this letter.

665
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,480
 Your Majesty, are you doing well? 

666
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,470
 Everyone is doing well here. 

667
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:22,880
 Byeokcheon looks a lot as it used to since we have been working hard rebuilding it. 

668
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,650
- Have you been well? 
  - Yes. 

669
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:31,170
His Majesty gifted us with this rice.

670
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,870
Did he really mention me in his letter?

671
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,510
Start at the fifth line.

672
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:44,520
 By the way, Princess sends me letters often. 

673
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:50,500
Why send personal letters to a man who is busy working for the country?

674
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,190
 She keeps insisting on visiting Mt. Jaeryong. 

675
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,610
 Please make sure to tell her this. 

676
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,260
 Mt. Jaeryong is shorter than Mt. Inwang, and it is less impressive than Mt. Bookak. 

677
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,240
 If you just want to see mountains, you would be better off going to Namsan- 

678
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,820
Why are you laughing, Royal Bodyguard?

679
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,980
I just laughed because I could not help it.

680
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:20,380
This tea is good for anger.

681
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,220
Drink it.

682
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,720
Let me get married!

683
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,190
It will have to be someone who qualifies.

684
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,330
He used to be the sergeant, and now he is the governor of Byeokcheon.

685
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,980
He is the eldest son of the Han family of Yeongsan.

686
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,710
He is kind and exceptionally loyal.

687
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,820
If he has a flaw, he does not understand women at all.

688
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:53,550
If he married me, I would be willing to forgive his flaw.

689
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,740
Please tell him that.

690
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:59,200
But I wonder if he would like Princess...

691
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,270
He should be honored!

692
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,210
He certainly should be.

693
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,450
By the way, what does this mean?

694
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,460
 The child you sent me is doing well. 

695
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,380
 However, something strange happened recently. 

696
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,140
 That woman came to Byeokcheon. 

697
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,140
Mother!

698
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,080
 Who are the child and the woman? 

699
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:45,500
Could the child you sent the governor of Byeokcheon be my brother?

700
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:49,980
As long as he is alive...

701
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,140
If he is alive with his mother, even though she may be insane,

702
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,660
I am satisfied with that.

703
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,130
   

704
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:15,350
 Your Majesty, you did not leave Maiden Jae Yi alone, did you? 

705
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:18,090
 Your hearts are already one. 

706
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,950
 What are you waiting for? 

707
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,970
 Joseon is in peace under your reign. 

708
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:30,070
 Now you should look after your heart. 

709
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:34,750
 Do not let her feel lonely anymore. 

710
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,940
Are you looking for Teacher?

711
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,320
He went to Hanseong-bu to check the body that just came in.

712
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,970
The flies keep going into my earthenware pots.

713
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,750
I am so worried that it would ruin the fermented goods.

714
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:01,970
Can you take care of something like that, too?

715
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:03,600
Of course, My Lady.

716
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:09,370
You just need to plant balsams or celosias around the pots.

717
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,790
Flies love flowers as much as bees.

718
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,170
They will prevent them from going into the pots.

719
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:16,890
How do you know stuff like that, too?

720
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,090
I learned from my teacher.

721
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,460
He knows about everything in this world.

722
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:31,330
He always tells me not to disregard even small things and learn about everything useful to people.

723
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,930
Looks like your teacher treats you well.

724
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:39,200
- Are you in love with him, by chance? 
 - Pardon?

725
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,770
Goodness! I could never dare...

726
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,560
My teacher is from an aristocratic family.

727
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,130
He is not someone I can have feelings like that for.

728
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:55,100
Also, his mother has a horrible personality!

729
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,650
Gosh! If she found out about me, I would be dead immediately!

730
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,910
- Did he speak badly of his mother? 
 - Have you not heard?

731
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:11,000
Everyone in the market knows how awful the Honorable Lady of Chief State Minister is!

732
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,490
Come inside quickly!

733
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:16,700
- My ear will fall off! 
 - You...

734
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,190
- Mother? 
 - Moth—

735
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,110
Mother!

736
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,770
It hurts! It hurts...

737
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,710
How long are you planning to do this for?

738
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:36,630
Is working as some silly troubleshooter in the market your great ambition?

739
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:41,060
A small help can change the lives of people who do not know how to read or understand the law.

740
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,810
So will you continue to do this with this girl?

741
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,350
I cannot allow this anymore!

742
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,890
You are no longer our son!

743
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,110
I will remove you from the family registry!

744
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,580
Do not tell anyone that you are my son from now on!

745
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,500
Then, whose son am I, Kim Myung Jin?

746
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,030
How dare you try to use that name?

747
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,350
Give up your name and live as you would like.

748
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,870
We came here to abandon you today.

749
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,300
Let us go!

750
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:33,640
Remove his name from the family registry?

751
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,570
How could he say something so harsh like that?

752
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,880
It is okay.

753
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,500
I have a separate name.

754
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,960
Pardon?

755
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,620
My name is...

756
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,950
Kom Mung Jin!

757
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:10,440
Does it not... go well with Jang Ga Ram?

758
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,150
I think they do go well together.

759
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,940
 According to Royal Physician Kim Ji Soo, 

760
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:28,700
 His Majesty cannot eat properly because he cannot digest. 

761
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:34,600
 It has been already over a year since he has been having sleepless nights. 

762
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,750
My apologies, Your Majesty.

763
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:41,360
I have been trying acupuncture and prescribing you various medicines,

764
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,360
but nothing has worked.

765
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,510
Is my illness serious?

766
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,910
I deserve to die, Your Majesty!

767
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:51,340
- I diagnosed you with the wrong disease! 
 - What?

768
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,030
I finally figured out what it was.

769
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:57,560
- The condition is called Eum Heo Hwa Dong. 
 - Eum Heo Hwa Dong?

770
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,100
Your body lacks yin energy.

771
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,820
Therefore you are hot and sweaty, have no appetite, and you lack energy.

772
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:09,610
That is... presumed to be lovesickness.

773
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,690
Scribe, you do not have to write that down.

774
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:22,610
 His Majesty looked around, looking very embarrassed 

775
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:26,090
 and told him not to write down "lovesickness." 

776
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:27,910
Come now. I told you not to write it down!

777
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:31,810
 He kept saying not to write it down. 

778
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,520
It makes perfect sense considering the timing.

779
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,870
It started when Eunuch Go moved to a private residence.

780
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,840
Be quiet!

781
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,620
Lovesickness?

782
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,810
It is not. I said it is not!

783
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:50,220
 Your Majesty, there is no way it is not! 

784
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,520
I told you it is not, how could you...

785
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,050
Your Majesty, there is no way it is not.

786
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,410
No. Look, stop writing it down.

787
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,880
I do not know why you are all doing this.

788
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,810
- Your Majesty... 
  - There is no way it is not! 

789
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,020
Your Majesty, that is certainly it.

790
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,890
You should all leave now.

791
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,760
 Come and open the gate! 

792
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:56,610
 Yang! 

793
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:58,300
- Dak! 
 - Dak! 

794
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,190
- Nab! 
  - Nab! 

795
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:02,250
- Bam! 
  - Bam! 

796
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,350
That is the end of the language lesson for today.

797
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,640
 Thank you, Ma'am! 

798
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,750
   

799
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,940
Who is this?

800
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,020
What brings you all the way here...

801
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,210
Have you been well?

802
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,480
Your face looks good. You must have been doing very well.

803
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,960
- Have you— 
 - I have not been well.

804
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,530
The palace is so quiet without you.

805
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,660
It does not feel like where people live.

806
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,670
Come with me.

807
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:07,110
Will you really keep your promise?

808
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:11,110
You said you would make me the head eunuch.

809
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:15,180
What kind of eunuch rides something like that?

810
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,750
I know it is late,

811
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:30,040
but this is my answer to your confession from that day.

812
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,250
You took too long, do you not think?

813
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,160
You always talk too much.

814
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,960
So do you not like it?

815
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,550
Well...

816
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,970
I do not dislike it.

817
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:49,080
Stop beating around the bush and speak properly.

818
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:54,010
I must hear your answer properly since you took so long.

819
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:58,950
I confessed my love alone, and you took this long.

820
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,160
Without hearing a proper answer, I will never-

821
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,320
I love you.

822
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:16,800
I also... love you, Jae Yi.

823
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:24,610
♫  Doo-doon, doo-doon. I can hear that sound  ♫

824
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:31,330
♫  Looks like you are about to blossom in me  ♫

825
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:37,800
♫  You already grew so much in my heart  ♫

826
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,000
♫  Your buds are about to blossom in my heart  ♫

827
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:50,960
♫  On that beautiful day, even the clouds parted  ♫

828
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,750
♫  You were the only one who appeared in my heart  ♫

829
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:05,170
♫  While spending countless days with you  ♫

830
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:11,780
♫  I shared everything I can share with you  ♫

831
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:18,260
♫  The only thing that makes me happy is being with you  ♫

832
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:23,650
♫  There will be no tomorrow without you  ♫

833
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:27,020
♫  The words that are way too sweet  ♫

834
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,240
♫  The words that seem so unfamiliar  ♫

835
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,590
♫  None of that is necessary  ♫

836
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:38,270
♫  It is not necessary between us  ♫

837
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:43,560
♫  I can tell even when we are apart  ♫

838
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,980
   

839
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:48,220
   

840
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:55,110
♫  I cannot like you more than I already do  ♫

841
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:02,880
♫  While spending countless days with you  ♫

842
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,250
♫  I shared everything I can share with you  ♫

843
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:15,820
♫  The only thing that makes me happy is being with you  ♫

844
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:21,030
♫  There will be no tomorrow without you  ♫

845
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:29,090
