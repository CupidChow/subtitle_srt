1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,570
   

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,480
   

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,320
   

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,950
   

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,510
   

6
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:25,086
   

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,160
   

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,000
   

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,030


10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,550
   

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,150
Your Highness.

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,520
It is merely a hawk.

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
Why am I not able to see the deer?

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,940
What is wrong, Your Highness?

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,210
Are you feeling unwell in any way?

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,930
No.

17
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,840
I am fine.

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,060
You go that way.

19
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,300
That was not mine.

20
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,910
I did not shoot an arrow at Your Highness!

21
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,960
It was not me. I did not do it!

22
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,310
If it was not you,

23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,380
then was it the deed of a ghost?

24
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,140
Your Highness,

25
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,690
I am...

26
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,570
here because of the secret letter that you sent, Your Highness.

27
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,730
What did you say?

28
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,160
Your Highness... sent a secret letter to my father–

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,390
Who is your father?

30
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,200
The governor of Gaeseong...

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,560
Sir Min Ho Seung.

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,300
His son, Min Yoon Jae, died along with his father.

33
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,150
Who are you?

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,150
Then that would mean you are his daughter,

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,650
Min Jae Yi.

36
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,420
Was it not enough for the murderer Min Jae Yi

37
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,850
to murder her family through poison?

38
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,190
She would also shoot an arrow at the Crown Prince of Joseon?

39
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,500
No. It was absolutely not me!

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,280
Also,

41
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,930
I never sent anything like a secret letter

42
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,750
to your father.

43
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,140
Why would I lie to someone like you?

44
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,840
You sent a secret letter along with the wedding gifts,

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,950
and I definitely saw your secret letter, Your Highness.

46
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,110
Your Highness.

47
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,870
I see that your fiance, whom you betrayed,

48
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,810
Sergeant Han Seong On, is coming.

49
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,610
Was this man the one who shot an arrow at you, Your Highness?

50
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,730
Your Highness, it was not me.

51
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm just here to drive the animals into the hunting path.

52
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,050
I did not bring anything like arrows when I entered the hunting grounds.

53
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,470
I am telling the truth.

54
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,330
Sergeant, take that bow and quiver and inspect it.

55
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,570
I have more things to ask this person.

56
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
What is your group, and what is your name?

57
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,570
I am Jang Chi Soo of the group Choongmuhoe.

58
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,570
   

59
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,730
Jang Chi Soo.

60
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,870
A Choongmuhoe artillery soldier born in the year of the white rabbit.

61
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,280
Six feet tall...

62
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,010
How are you six feet tall?

63
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,290
His Highness has the entire list of enlisted men memorized!

64
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,010
I have committed a grave sin against you, Your Highness.

65
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,740
I heard that, if you get selected as a soldier of the fifth degree,

66
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,090
you receive 18 liters of barley every month, so I lied about my height.

67
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,630
It appears that he exaggerated his height to get a job.

68
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,580
Yes, since I am the only male in my household who is physically capable.

69
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,860
Then take off your uniform.

70
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,410
Pardon?

71
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,650
You must have hurt your arm falling over because of me.

72
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,730
If the injury is severe, should we not call the physician?

73
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,500
Your Highness, it is such a mild bruise that I would be embarrassed to receive such grace from you.

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,140
I shall check for myself, so bring him to my tent.

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,890
Follow me.

76
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,030
   

77
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,040
Did His Highness really catch all of these?

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,140
It appears that it was not that His Highness could not quash the rumors,

79
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,470
but that he was letting it grow.

80
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,240
Since he managed to quash the rumors in front of everyone's eyes,

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,140
it appears that all of the bad rumors surrounding His Highness will come to an end today.

82
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,780
Your Highness, since we now have the sacrifices to offer up,

83
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,620
please write a celebratory message that is fitting for the sacrifice.

84
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,590
This is the pure water that I received for the sacrifice to the celestial beings.

85
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,790
   

86
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,320
Do I only have to write this message?

87
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,410
What do you mean by that?

88
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,590
I am asking because I feel that I need to pass your test

89
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,430
in order to preserve my position as Crown Prince.

90
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,990
Your Highness, that makes no sense.

91
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,470
How could we dare test the Crown Prince?

92
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,860
Right.

93
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,140
They say that the Crown Prince is the blessing of all,

94
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,810
but to think that people would discuss my worth as Crown Prince just because I got hit by an arrow...

95
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,120
That was really upsetting.

96
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,960
Therefore, today needs to be the last time

97
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,870
I have to prove myself

98
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,580
as the Crown Prince.

99
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,770
   

100
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,370
You are an excellent scribe, as always, Your Highness.

101
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,550
Did you only lie about your height?

102
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,710
If so, then do not worry too much.

103
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,240
He will not punish you too harshly.

104
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,790
   

105
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,900
What in the world is this?

106
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,320
Blood...

107
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,310
You are bleeding, Your Highness!

108
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,350
Your Highness!

109
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,540
- Did you get hurt, Your Highness? 
 - I did not get hurt.

110
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,810
Bring some water for me to wash with.

111
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,150
Bring some water!

112
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,700
How could such a strange thing happen, unless it is a trick played by a ghost?

113
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,140
Do not speak such profane words.

114
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,420
A trick played by a ghost?

115
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,290
There is no wound.

116
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,450
Where did the blood come from...?

117
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,200
 Is it one of you? 

118
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,530
 The one who dares toying with the Crown Prince? 

119
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,400
Sergeant Han Seong On!

120
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,320
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,660
Inspect all the men and soldiers under the ranking of cabinet members.

122
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,370
If you spot anything suspicious, report it to me immediately.

123
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,250
Yes, Your Highness.

124
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,200
As soon as you finish inspecting the garments of the first row,

125
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,140
you are to inspect the second row's garments then.

126
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,040
Yes, Sir.

127
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,650
From now, we will inspect men who are below cabinet member ranking!

128
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,900
What are you doing here?

129
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,820
Inspection.

130
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,170
Inspection.

131
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,380
 Sergeant Han Seong On. 

132
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,310
 - What's wrong? 
 - We are in big trouble. 

133
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,120
 Is he ugly? 

134
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,400
 I will look at him once more and tell you. 

135
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,170
 What do we do...? 

136
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,720
 My Lady cares a lot about a man's face... 

137
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,910
 His shoulders are also important. 

138
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,480
 Of course, it is important. 

139
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,770
 I would hope that his shoulders are broad. 

140
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,040
 But even if his nose 

141
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,540
 is slightly crooked, it is fine, right? 

142
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,820
 Is it crooked? 

143
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,940
 Yes. I mean, he has two nostrils, but that is about it. 

144
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,130
 What do we do...? 

145
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,170
 Gosh... what are we to do...? 

146
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,680
 He is such a manly man. 

147
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
 Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my! 

148
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,670
 His shoulders are so broad... 

149
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,340
 His picturesque eyebrows... 

150
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,950
 The perfect collaboration of nose and cheekbone... 

151
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,500
 Look at how full his lower lip is. 

152
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,380
 Oh, yes. 

153
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,100
 I have not seen a more handsome man 

154
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,240
 while growing up in Joseon. 

155
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,450
 Oh, but Lady, the love based on a man's face only lasts at most three years. 

156
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,140
 Did not Father guarantee his character? 

157
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,790
 What do you think? 

158
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,080
 Do you think we look good together? 

159
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,210
 Well, I mean, a bit... 

160
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,770
 You look so good together! 

161
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,370
 He's handsome, right? 

162
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,240
 Yes. 

163
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,940
 What do I do...? 

164
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,020
 I do not care who it is, 

165
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,070
 so someone, please... 

166
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,170
You are coming with me.

167
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,930
- Are you there, Guardian Warrior? 
 - Yes, Your Highness.

168
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,490
Guard my tent along with the soldiers who have completed their inspection.

169
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,670
Make sure to prevent anyone from entering.

170
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,610
Yes, Your Highness.

171
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,380
You guys will follow me.

172
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,050
 Yes, Sir! 

173
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,930
Seeing how I have become bloodied in front of everyone,

174
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,320
I would not be surprise if this water also has poison.

175
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,160
Will you drink this?

176
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,460
I will do so, Your Highness.

177
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,540
It is refreshing.

178
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,710
Wicked things have occurred nonstop from the moment I met you.

179
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,600
It was not enough for you to poison your family to death,

180
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,460
but you would even try to kill the nation's Crown Prince?

181
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,280
No.

182
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,400
You would dare shoot an arrow at me

183
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,980
and make a fool out of the Crown Prince in front of high officials

184
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,860
by tarnishing the celebratory message for the celestial sacrifice?

185
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,230
I did not do anything, Your Highness.

186
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,350
Your Highness, please listen to me just once–

187
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,690
Tae Kang, are you outside?

188
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,000
Tie him up immediately.

189
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Yes, Your Highness.

190
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,080
- You, over there! 
  - Yes! 

191
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,890
Is this the one who tarnished the celebratory message?

192
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,770
He is a prime suspect.

193
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,910
I will take him to the palace and interrogate him personally.

194
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,110
It was not me, Your Highness.

195
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,250
I am not the one. How could I do such a bad thing to the celebratory message?

196
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,520
Shut your mouth!

197
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,620
Whom do you think is standing before you that you would dare speak?

198
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,590
Please believe me, Your Highness.

199
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,210
I did not do any of the things you are suspicious of.

200
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,020
I never did such a thing, Your Highness!

201
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,710
How dare you!

202
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,630
Stop.

203
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,610
You would not gain anything from attracting attention

204
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,330
at the military training hunting grounds.

205
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,370
If you want to preserve your life for a bit longer,

206
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,940
it would be best for you to go without making a fuss.

207
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,840
Just what... was the Lady thinking?

208
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,530
Where did she go?

209
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,180
I am such an idiot!

210
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,580
I should have said I would follow her, no matter what!

211
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,370
Would your head break like that?

212
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,860
Gosh, worrying will not help you now.

213
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,480
I mean, is our Lady just any maiden from a random family?

214
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,060
Geez.

215
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,430
You should worry about yourself.

216
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,350
I know.

217
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,620
What was that?

218
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,210
Did something happen?

219
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,470
They say that there is a Crown Prince's procession.

220
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,920
Really?

221
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,210
A Crown Prince's procession?

222
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,610
It looks like there is a Crown Prince's procession.

223
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,600
Let us go and see.

224
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,780
Oh, Chi Soo, why are you here?

225
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,040
Did you not go to the military training hunting grounds?

226
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,360
What? The military training hunting grounds? Why would I go there?

227
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,340
I heard that the soldiers were chosen to drive animals toward the hunting route.

228
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,900
What?

229
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,950
Is that true?

230
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,670
Yeah, that is what I heard...

231
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,880
Hey, Ga Ram!

232
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,390
 So exciting! 

233
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,150
 Goodness. Wow. 

234
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,950
Wow, the Crown Prince caught all of these?

235
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,150
No way, they said that the arm he injured last time had not recovered fully yet.

236
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,410
 Move out of the way! 

237
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,980
 Make way. 

238
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,930
 Make way for the Crown Prince. 

239
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,510
 Move out of the way. 

240
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,210
 Make way for the Crown Prince. 

241
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,210
Stop.

242
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,580
Stop the procession.

243
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,020
Your Highness, what is the matter?

244
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,920
Did you not bring that to give to me?

245
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
Yes, Sir.

246
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,300
I brought it to give it to you, Crown Prince.

247
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,170
His right arm is perfectly fine.

248
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,030
- Yeah, it appears so. 
 - I guess he has fully recovered.

249
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,130
Our Crown Prince...

250
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,630
It is pretty.

251
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,290
Thank you.

252
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,280
Our Crown Prince

253
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,300
also seems to know how to manipulate people's hearts.

254
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,900
As his servant,

255
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,070
I feel he is very reliable.

256
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,190
Hey, Ga Ram!

257
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,070
What do we do, Orabeoni!

258
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,780
I do not see our Lady!

259
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,000
She must to be among the soldiers...

260
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,340
Did something happen to her?

261
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,480
Why isn't she here?

262
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,580
Please... protect our Lady,

263
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,130
who did nothing wrong.

264
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,500
Wherever she may be,

265
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,410
please let her be able to have a warm meal,

266
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,560
and please give her at least a straw mat to sleep on.

267
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,500
Please.

268
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,240
Hey!

269
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,500
A clean piece of paper became tarnished with blood

270
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,820
as soon as he started writing the celebratory message.

271
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,760
Isn't this such a strange occurrence?

272
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,190
Your Majesty, what a relief it is that the Crown Prince is perfectly fine, right?

273
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,900
We were not able to catch the person who shot the arrow at the Crown Prince a year ago.

274
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,750
Are you not aware that treacherous men are trying to kill the Crown Prince?

275
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,440
Your Majesty, since the Crown Prince demonstrated that he is in no way lacking

276
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,610
as the Crown Prince during the military training hunt,

277
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,630
have we not achieved our purposes?

278
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,630
That will not be enough.

279
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,600
You must not forget what I have told you many times before.

280
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,580
You must not forget

281
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,960
the Crown Prince Ui Hyeon's death.

282
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,600
Your Majesty.

283
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,680
I am... constantly thinking about what you are concerned,

284
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,000
so do not worry, Father.

285
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,720
Goodness! Oh, my.

286
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,110
Why did you follow me here instead of going home?

287
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,610
Are you not even going to offer me some tea?

288
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:51,430
If you do not have anything to say to me, go home.

289
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,040
Hyungnim.

290
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,190
Did you do that, Hyungnim?

291
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,270
Blood was dripping from his hands...

292
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,210
You know, making it bleed from the Crown Prince's hand while he was writing the celebratory message.

293
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,230
 The Crown Prince must be disabled, as the rumors say. 

294
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,360
 For the sake of Your Highness and Grand Prince. 

295
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,610
Your Highness, what are you thinking about?

296
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,300
I am not thinking about anything.

297
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,120
Since my uncle has told me not to think about anything.

298
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,100
Hyungnim.

299
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,500
Do you think I did that?

300
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,960
All I wanted

301
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,770
was for that arrogant Crown Prince to get a bit frightened!

302
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,330
I feel like it was you, Hyungnim.

303
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,970
As you commanded, I locked him in the warehouse.

304
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,630
 You sent a secret letter along with the wedding gifts, 

305
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,850
 and I definitely saw your secret letter, Your Highness. 

306
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,940
   

307
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,460
 I have burned every single letter I had written, 

308
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,620
 and even Tae Kang does not know about its contents. 

309
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,660
 How is she saying that she got a secret letter that I never sent? 

310
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,780
Prepare to go out. I must see him.

311
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,600
Untie him.

312
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,100
It is already untied.

313
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,900
How dare you! Where do you think this is?

314
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,120
Look at this guy!

315
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
Are you not going to lift your butt?

316
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,840
Are you not going to lift your butt?

317
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,060
Were you going to try to run away?

318
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,670
I untied it because my arms hurt.

319
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,990
If I wanted to run away, I would have done so in the fields, earlier.

320
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,660
How would you have done that?

321
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,710
I was there, so how would you have been able to escape?

322
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,780
Forgive me, Your Highness.

323
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,510
I do not carry it around to attack anyone.

324
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:43,110
It is just a dagger I keep on me to protect myself.

325
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,700
Kang, go outside and stay there.

326
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,130
Are you not quite amazing that as a woman,

327
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,990
you managed to come all the way here from Gaeseong

328
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,790
despite being wanted and even carrying a dagger.

329
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,780
I heard you managed to defeat over ten soldiers while on the run.

330
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,600
Is that not just fitting

331
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,720
of a suspect who has managed to escape on the run despite betraying her family?

332
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,050
I cannot die like this.

333
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,960
I must find the real culprit so that I can obtain justice for my family's death!

334
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,520
Why did you come to me instead of going to the Sergeant?

335
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,550
It would be much safer for you to go to the Sergeant.

336
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,630
My very existence has become hell for him.

337
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,710
How could I ask him to be swept away in additional rumors?

338
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,770
Your Highness.

339
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,530
My family's death might be connected to the secret letter that you sent–

340
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,210
I told you I've never sent any secret letter.

341
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,060
You should go to the Sergeant instead.

342
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,960
- If it is the Sergeant, he will– 
 - The letter from a ghost...

343
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,950
What did you just say?

344
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,690
Your Highness said that you received a letter from a ghost, three years ago.

345
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,030
You dare try to threaten me with rumors you heard on the streets?

346
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,320
"A ghost dares to say to Yi Hwan.

347
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,130
You should take heed to these words. You became Crown Prince by killing your brother..."

348
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,940
I did not kill my brother.

349
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,910
"but you will never become king."

350
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,690
You wretch! Shut your mouth!

351
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,720
It was written in your secret letter, Your Highness.

352
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,790
You said you received a curse through a letter from a ghost, three years ago.

353
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,400
On the day that Crown Prince Ui Hyeon passed away,

354
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,910
on the day that you were installed as the Crown Prince,

355
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,160
on the day you first entered the palace of the Crown Prince.

356
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,210
 I want to be alone, so stop following me. 

357
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,130
 Yes, Your Highness. 

358
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,870
   

359
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,710
 Your Highness said that you could not tell anyone about the letter. 

360
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,980
 Because it had said that you killed Crown Prince Ui Hyeon 

361
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,240
 and became the crown prince. 

362
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,710
I did not kill my brother.

363
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,500
It was not me.

364
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,780
I did not serve peaches to him.

365
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,210
Why would I kill my own blood, born of the same mother?

366
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,930
To me, my brother was...

367
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,820
someone I could never measure up to,

368
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,650
he was my friend,

369
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,430
and my teacher.

370
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,210
So why would I desire his position...

371
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,440
I have never coveted the position of the crown prince.

372
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,810
 You had said that was how you burned the first cursed letter that was sent to you. 

373
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,580
 However, two years later, the letter from the ghost reappeared. 

374
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,890
 Another line was written in red then. 

375
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,250
 "Yoo Gang Gul Jo." 

376
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,180
 "Yoo Go Bul Yong." 

377
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,110
 "Despite having arms, you will not be able to use them. 

378
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,970
 "And, despite having legs, you will not be able to walk." 

379
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:58,720
And Your Highness... was shot by an arrow according to the ghost's curse.

380
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,480
 Master Min, 

381
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,280
 I have learned not to trust anyone ever since then. 

382
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,420
 And I do not tell anyone my true feelings .

383
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,320
 I have become an ill-tempered and small-minded man. 

384
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,760
 My life is... 

385
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,470
 pitch dark without any light. 

386
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,650
 As I spend those pitch dark nights alone, 

387
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,530
 I am destroying myself as I become more twisted inside. 

388
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,010
 That is why you said you needed the help of your master, my father. 

389
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,600
I told you, I never sent him a secret letter.

390
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,970
I clearly saw it.

391
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,930
He sent my brother Min Yoon Jae, who had solved many cases in Gaeseong, to the palace secretively

392
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,220
and asked him to investigate the cursed letter from the ghost.

393
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,910
Even if

394
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,740
Master Min had received that letter, he would have never shown it to you.

395
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,940
How could a master show a letter from his student to his daughter-

396
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,470
The person Your Highness was looking for was not my orabeoni.

397
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,430
His Highness is summoning Yoon Jae, but

398
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,820
you are actually the person His Highness needs.

399
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,690
Even so, I cannot send you to meet Crown Prince since you are about to be wed.

400
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,080
The one who resolved many cases in the Gaeseong County

401
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,350
was not my orabeoni. It was me.

402
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,920
After Master Min became the governor of Gaeseong,

403
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,320
numerous cases were resolved under his son's name Min Yoon Jae.

404
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,040
The praise for him was all throughout, even Hanyang. But then...

405
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,590
you are now saying all of that was your achievement?

406
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,250
Do you expect me to believe that?

407
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,680
If you give me a chance, I will prove myself!

408
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,920
I picked up the wanted poster on my way into the capital.

409
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,600
They were looking for eyewitnesses to murders that had occurred inside the capital.

410
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,110
I will resolve these cases and prove myself.

411
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,470
How can I trust you enough to give you such a chance?

412
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,440
Do you even have one piece of evidence that could prove that you're not the wicked murderer

413
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,010
who poisoned your own parents and sibling?

414
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,830
You had written in the letter, Your Highness!

415
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,770
To burn the letter after I read it!

416
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,560
Your Highness, are you truly saying you never received a letter from a ghost?

417
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,340
You truly never wrote a secret letter to my father?

418
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,150
I am not testing you based on the rumors that are out in the streets, Your Highness.

419
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,810
Without a secret letter from you,

420
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,010
how could I know what was written in that letter from a ghost?

421
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,830
Rather than believing what you say,

422
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,080
what happened with the celebratory message at the hunting grounds would be more believable.

423
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,730
That is correct. The celebratory message at the hunting grounds was trickery.

424
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,550
There is no such thing as a ghost in this world.

425
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,820
Only deceptive appearance by human

426
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,000
that is scarier than ghosts.

427
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,160
If you wish to see the truth, Your Highness,

428
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,980
you will be able to believe me.

429
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,670
And you will be able to find human deception hiding behind a ghost alongside me.

430
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,930
If sappan wood and melted alum touch each other, 
  (T/N: Medicinal herb, used for its red color) 

431
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,650
it has the property of changing into red liquid like blood.

432
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,500
Your Highness washed your hands before writing the celebratory message

433
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,510
and I'm sure that water was probably had melted alum, not purely water.

434
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,600
 It was chaotic throughout the hunt. 

435
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:06,100
 It could not have been difficult to put sappan wood dust on the brush handle and put melted alum in the water. 

436
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,490
That is how it happened.

437
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,450
The culprit knew the custom surrounding writing the celebratory message.

438
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,570
It is someone who could easily approach the brush and water.

439
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,560
It was not the work of a ghost, Your Highness.

440
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,500
It's a method that shamans commonly use to rip money off of people in private homes.

441
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,870
I have worked on a case that had something to do with such a method.

442
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,570
The method used by shamans?

443
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,520
Good, good.

444
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,000
Goodness, did I eat something wrong...

445
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,450
- Look how ridiculous you look! 
 - Should I just do chores around here?

446
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,370
I should do something to help My Lady's cause during that time.

447
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,650
I mean, what will you do?

448
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,340
Gosh, why am I so scared?

449
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,950
Look how ridiculous you look!

450
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,650
I'll be back!

451
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,120
Where are you going? Where? Hey, Ga Ram!

452
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,690
I'm sure they said this is the Chief State Minister's residence.

453
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,130
If that's the case,

454
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,680
that crazy man must live here, too.

455
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,400
What kind of things will unfold today?

456
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,360
The weather is so bright.

457
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,490
Myung Jin, it is as though I am looking at your bright future.

458
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,070
Let us give it all once again today.

459
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,500
Young Master.

460
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,850
What is this about?

461
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,180
I have something to say to you, Young Master...

462
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,350
Well, I did have it...

463
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,880
And?

464
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,100
I will just take my leave.

465
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,910
What are you doing?

466
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,000
How can you just leave after startling someone so hard like that?

467
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,100
It is nothing.

468
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,280
Come on now. You said you had something to say.

469
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,850
I heard that you are so amazing and could tell the cause of death as soon as you see a corpse, so...

470
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,930
Is that so? Is there such a rumor?

471
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,780
A rumor like that is going around?

472
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,720
That's right! That is who I am.

473
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,230
So...

474
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,660
- I thought I'd become your student... 
 - You want to become my student?

475
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,450
Gosh, no! No!

476
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,250
I did want to become your student, but... I think it's better if I don't.

477
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,430
- How come? 
 - With your small nerve like that, how could I serve you as my master?

478
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,630
I cannot bring myself to have respect for you.

479
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,160
- I will find another teacher. 
 - Come now!

480
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,400
You sure are quite offensive.

481
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,420
So, you wanted to make me your teacher all on your own

482
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,660
and you just rejected me on your own?

483
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,220
My heart belongs to me.

484
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,410
I do whatever I want to do. Why would you care?

485
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,670
Thank you. Okay, I reject you.

486
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,310
All right, then.

487
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,720
You cannot!

488
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,440
You hurt my feelings.

489
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,020
So what? What do you want me to do?

490
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,840
You will be my student.

491
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,350
- Follow me. 
 - Right this minute?

492
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,240
You came to the front of my house early this morning.

493
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,820
Why postpone it much longer?

494
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,190
Gosh! Is it okay for me to believe that crazy man?

495
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,790
I wonder if he knows anything worth learning from.

496
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,930
Come on, come on, come on!

497
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,260
You are a slowpoke!

498
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,070
Hurry and follow me!

499
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,160
I wonder what His Highness is planning to do with me.

500
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,380
   

501
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,090
In order to demand more money and treasure from private homes,

502
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,810
shamans commonly use this method.

503
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,310
Shamans?

504
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,080
In all things, there is an objective.

505
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,350
It must have been an attempt to bruise Crown Prince's authority.

506
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:57,050
Wicked schemes against Crown Prince means it is also aiming at this nation.

507
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,860
He must be found out and be punished as a warning to others.

508
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,500
 Yes, Your Majesty! 

509
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,530
My apologies, Your Highness.

510
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,790
It was my fault for the flaw in managing the grounds.

511
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,130
I will find out who brought in water and the brush from the department of Taoism.

512
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,840
Did you look into the bow and quiver from the hunting grounds?

513
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,380
Yes, it is commonly used by the ministry of defense.

514
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,510
The one that hit the tree next to you was also the same kind and there was no poison on the arrow.

515
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,040
So it was not a poisoned arrow. That is a relief.

516
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,010
How about bringing in all the men who were at the hunting grounds and investigating them separately?

517
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,310
It was a hunting ground.

518
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,940
Someone else's arrow aiming at an animal must have flown toward me by mistake.

519
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,570
Even so, how could one make such a mistake with you?

520
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,900
Do not be so sure.

521
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:20,380
There is no rule that says your arrow would not fly toward me by mistake, Sergeant Han.

522
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,000
How could you say this, Your Highness?

523
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,650
I swear to you that my arrow will never fly toward you at any given moment, Your Highness.

524
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,610
I was joking.

525
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,950
Tens of soldiers were summoned to the military training hunt.

526
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,950
Just because he used an arrow that is commonly used by the Defense Ministry,

527
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,820
what good would it do to investigate each and every one of them and make this matter into something bigger?

528
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,590
More importantly,

529
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,140
find who played around with the celebratory message.

530
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,050
Did he get to eat?

531
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,660
Whom are you talking about, Your Majesty?

532
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,860
By chance, are you talking about that bastard we locked up yesterday?

533
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,600
Well, I...

534
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,560
got kicked by him. Should I still have taken care of him?

535
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,840
He solved the mystery of the celebratory message.

536
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,790
It was chilly last night. Are you telling me you did not even give him a brazier?

537
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,990
I did not feel like–

538
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,090
I am sorry that I did not anticipate what you would have wanted.

539
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,880
Since when did Joseon's custom become so cold and harsh?

540
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,080
Who would dare... use shaman's method?

541
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,550
It is them! The Jo family of Seongju.

542
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,500
If it were not for Right State Minister,

543
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,900
who would dare plan and pull off such a horrible stunt?

544
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,660
Do you also think so?

545
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,190
Right State Minister...

546
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,180
might not have done that.

547
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:05,190
 None of us know 

548
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,590
 what His Majesty is thinking. 

549
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,610
 He was born as a son of a palace water maid. 

550
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,630
He used Right State Minister and his family to empower royal authority.

551
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,650
Why do you think he married the current Queen?

552
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,080
Queen is Right State Minister's niece

553
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,270
and Right State Minister is the best family of Joseon,

554
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,240
the center of the Jo family of Seongju.

555
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,160
 If he cannot prove himself, I will depose him. 

556
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,750
 There is one more grand prince remaining. 

557
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,750
 So what worry is there for this nation? 

558
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,010
You mean His Majesty is considering Prince Myung Ahn instead of His Highness?

559
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,400
How can you say such a horrible thing?

560
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,010
If His Majesty's goal is to strengthen royal authority,

561
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,220
it is indeed true that His Majesty is anxious at the moment.

562
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,150
It is not as though His Highness has a strong maternal family like Grand Prince Myung Ahn.

563
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,900
That he is cursed by a ghost...

564
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,460
and there is even a seditious rumor about Prince Ui Hyeon's death.

565
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,670
Even so, His Highness is flesh and blood of His Majesty.

566
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,970
To receive Jo family of Seongju's help, would His Majesty abandon his son?

567
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,440
Something like that

568
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,820
should not happen.

569
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,700
 Hello! 

570
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,250
 Look over here! 

571
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,100
- Gosh! 
 - You're out and about, Young Master!

572
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,890
- Is your stomach feeling better? 
 - Yes, yes.

573
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,210
- Good day. 
 - Oh, my!

574
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,940
All right.

575
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,170
It's rice cake!

576
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,580
Young Master, you're here. Aigoo!

577
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,900
You didn't even pay...

578
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,750
The best rice cakes is the one freshly steamed.

579
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Enjoy!

580
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,000
Try one.

581
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,340
- How much? 
 - Gosh, forget it.

582
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,850
Just go, please.

583
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:18,990
Thanks to the ointment you made last time,my son's boil has disappeared.

584
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,580
Giving you all this rice cake would not be enough.

585
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:26,170
Gosh, is that so? It is nice hearing good news this morning.

586
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,230
 Yes! 

587
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:35,330
Well, but... are you not curious about who this is?

588
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,380
Looks like it's my first time seeing you. Who are you?

589
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:48,110
My student.

590
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,500
He heard the rumor about me and came to me.

591
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,090
Oh, I see...

592
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,660
A lot?

593
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,430
- Slightly. 
 - Right?

594
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,780
What a relief.

595
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,980
Watch the fire.

596
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,170
Do it like that, okay?

597
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,690
- Gosh... 
 - There...

598
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,520
Did you sleep well?

599
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,400
Oh, my!

600
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,240
We slept well, thanks to you, Young Master.

601
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,880
For days, we thought we were dying because of fleas.

602
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,750
We sprayed the water you gave us and all the fleas were caught.

603
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,190
So we had a good night's sleep for the first time in a while.

604
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,660
So what did you use to make the solution?

605
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,840
Gosh, I cannot let you in on my top secret.

606
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,910
If you're that curious...

607
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,610
I'll let you know that there is cinnamon in it.

608
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,620
That's why the scent was...

609
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,670
So who is this person?

610
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,140
- He's my student. 
 - Your student?

611
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,920
Yes, nice to meet you. I'm his student.

612
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,930
Gosh. He left.

613
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,450
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes...

614
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,200
On top of making herb medicine, do you even make solutions to get rid of bugs?

615
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,340
It would be faster to find something I cannot make.

616
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,400
Do you understand now

617
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
that I may not be so gutsy

618
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,830
but my skills and character are so great that everyone knows about them.

619
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:42,740
Am I not perfect as a teacher?

620
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,090
Yes, well...

621
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:52,640
Be sure to serve me well. I will be good to you as well.

622
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,790
Here?

623
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,160
Where is this place?

624
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,470
It is my research lab.

625
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,360
Research lab?

626
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,760
Manyeondang.

627
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,440
Everything in this world.

628
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,550
It means it's a place that studies everything in the world.

629
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,870
It is a temporary pass that allows you to leave the palace.

630
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,050
I cannot let a treacherous felon stay by my side.

631
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,960
Take that and leave the palace.

632
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,540
Your Highness! Are you really going to kick me out?

633
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,780
Take your time looking around.

634
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,770
What's this...

635
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:05,180
Where did you find all these?

636
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,000
 Wait, this is... 
   

637
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,900
Do you know her?

638
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,270
Isn't she the murderer from Gaeseong—

639
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,830
My student, she is not like that.

640
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,170
Say hello.

641
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:31,140
The best investigator in Joseon.

642
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,130
The woman your teacher is in love with...

643
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,610
Maiden Min Jae Yi!

644
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,430
Pardon?

645
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,640
You... love this woman?

646
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,910
Yeah.

647
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,790
I love this woman.

648
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,880
Very, very much...

649
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,370
My gosh.

650
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,200
   

651
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,880
Whether you go to the Royal Investigation Bureau or Gaeseong County after you leave the palace,

652
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,950
you prove your innocence on your own.

653
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,850
Bastard.

654
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:20,410
You will... never be a good king.

655
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,070
You are a terrible bastard!

656
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,100
- Are you– 
 - Yes, I'm talking to you!

657
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,850
Why? Are you shocked to hear a girl curse?

658
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,220
You must be insane.

659
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,530
Right? You are crazy, are you not?

660
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,150
That's correct! I am insane.

661
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,140
How can I afford not to go mad and throw a fuss right now?

662
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,600
Did you tell me to go to Royal Investigation Bureau?

663
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,420
Did you tell me to go to Gaeseong County?

664
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,470
The wanted poster with my face is posted all over the country.

665
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,460
What could I possibly fear?

666
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,910
I will probably... go through a hard time without a chance to clear my name,

667
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:57,400
confess the crime I did not commit and die by beheading.

668
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,430
Whether I die by arguing with you jerk

669
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,500
or get my limbs torn apart. It would be all the same.

670
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,710
How dare you call the Crown Prince of Joseon a "bastard, jerk"?

671
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:07,970
You were just lucky enough to be born into a royal family and became a crown prince.

672
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,860
What is so great about you?

673
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,290
What?

674
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,330
- How dare you say that to... 
 - That is right!

675
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,580
A girl dares to...

676
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,370
I am only a woman who was framed and is being chased. What could I possibly do?

677
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,820
No...

678
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,220
From the moment I was born as a girl in Joseon, what was I permitted to do?

679
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:32,320
Did Joseon ever tell a girl, "Yes, you can. Do it. Try it"?

680
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,820
So... it looks like you have more to say.

681
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,300
Continue.

682
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,030
I got unlucky, got framed, and became a murderer.

683
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:53,550
I was a precious daughter to my father and mother.

684
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:57,130
And I was a lovely younger sister to my older brother.

685
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,730
You and I are no different under heaven!

686
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,460
My father, who was your master...

687
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,660
was genuinely happy when you became the

688
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,210
Crown Prince taking after Prince Ui Hyeon.

689
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,330
You, who are so cold and arrogant...

690
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,780
He believed that you would be a good king. As for me...

691
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,370
As for me,

692
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:28,830
I held onto my father's faith in you

693
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:33,300
and in hopes of becoming your very first people bowing under your feet,

694
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,370
I thought I would get to find out

695
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:40,570
the reason my family died if I could meet you. So I came all the way here, risking my life!

696
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,590
I thought you would not ignore me.

697
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,240
I am your master's daughter

698
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,630
and your master died because of you.

699
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,730
It is all your fault!

700
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:57,650
My family died because of you! It is your fault, you bastard!

701
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,600
If you are someone who would look away from my desperate plea,

702
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,470
I would rather die in front of you.

703
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,960
I will end up dying anyway.

704
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:26,260
Look over here! Here is a woman who committed a treacherous crime!

705
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,600
Please take me away!

706
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,590
But please listen to what I have to say.

707
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:34,760
The Crown Prince of Joseon received a cursed letter from a ghost.

708
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,680
The rumor on the streets is true!

709
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:08,880


710
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,320
   

711
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,030
 Your Highness, please help me. 

712
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,010
 Are you making a deal with me? 

713
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,240
 Where is this place? 

714
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,440
 Did you do everything? 

715
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,370
 Crown Prince is not King yet. 

716
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,740
 What is your intention in dressing up as a man? 

717
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,970
 I have to be a man, so my voice can reach the world. 

718
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:42,560
 I only wish to relieve my family's resentment and return to my fiance. 

719
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,720
 Are you certain? 

720
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,870
 Do you not realize that Crown Prince does not trust you, either? 

721
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,760
 - I will give you a chance. 
 - I shall find out for sure.
