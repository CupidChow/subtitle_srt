1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,610
   

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,400
   

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,000
   

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,460
   

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,000
   

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,300
   

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,960
   

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,790
   

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,650


10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,720
 Have you been healthy and well? 

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,660
 There was a landslide here due to heavy rain, 

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,510
 and officials discovered a tombstone that has nothing to do with my family 

13
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,610
 that had ended up in my family gravesite. 

14
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,020
A tombstone?

15
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,380
Does that not refer to a stone used to mark a grave?

16
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,570
Why would another family's tombstone end up in my master's family gravesite?

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
   

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,730
   

19
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,100
It appears the location where the tombstone was buried was suspicious.

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,470
According to the feng shui expert, that land was where a king was to be born,

21
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,150
so it was already devoted to His Majesty.

22
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,430
Someone used such precious land secretly as a family shrine?

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,740
If they used the land where the king was to be born as a family shrine,

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,370
does that not show they were trying to make their child the king?

25
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,360
Who would dare... to do such a thing...

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,520
 Surprisingly, the owner of the tombstone 

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,360
 was a man named Song Soo Cheon who died June 25th in the year of the Red Dragon. 

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,150
 Do you remember that name? 

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,530
 Is that not the name of Song, who was hung in front of Sungnyemun Gate? 

30
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,230
This is... unbelievable.

31
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,660
Your Highness, did you know what happened

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,120
to the Governor of Gaeseong had to do with the remnant of Byeokcheon?

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,220
   

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,040
 Just as it is written in this tombstone, 

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,320
 there will be a son of Song who is alive by the name of Song Hyun, 

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,600
 who was born on March 9th in the year of the Red Snake. 

37
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,750
How could this be...

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,460
This is unbelievable.

39
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,270
- What is the matter? 
 - March 9...

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,790
in the year of the Red Snake,

41
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,120
the son of Song...

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,670
Is it the birthday of someone you know—

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,570
If this is really true, then what do we do?

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,900
    
 A long time ago,

45
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,780
a child named Hyun was born.

46
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,580
Hyun's father was a blacksmith,

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,500
 and Hyun's mother was a courtesan. 

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,640
What is this?

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,950
Did I not ask you to sharpen this into a blade?

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,740
Whom are you trying to slash with such a small blade?

51
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,500
You do not need to know, so take this back and sharpen it for me.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,090
If you are thinking of killing yourself, forget it.

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,110
Mind your own business.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,680
You must live.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,140
No matter how much I entertain guests, I cannot decrease my debt.

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,350
So what is the point of living?

57
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,390
How much is your debt?

58
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,510
I heard your family managed to increase your wealth severalfold,

59
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,540
but do you really want to waste the wealth your ancestors passed down to you to have a mere courtesan?

60
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,060
I have no plans of doing that.

61
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,110
I will pay for your debts, so keep living and leave this place.

62
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,560
I just want to see someone as beautiful as you leave this place.

63
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,160
This is how I truly feel.

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,480
I am not... someone that precious.

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,400
Even my father sold me at six for just 8kg of barley.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,190
Do not do something so foolish being intoxicated by a woman's beauty.

67
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,700
I know you are a kind person.

68
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,400
I do not want to see a world where a kind person kills herself.

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,310
I want to save a kind person.

70
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,970
Hurry! Catch it!

71
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,930
Hurry up and catch that thing!

72
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,200
Whose house is this?

73
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,840
It has been a while since we had something to celebrate like this,

74
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,800
so how could you try to just gloss over it?

75
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,870
These are chickens that have escaped from Scholar Park's house.

76
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,540
I need to sit them down safely here and return them safely.

77
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,550
Make sure you do not cause him any harm!

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,320
Gosh, why would a bride lack such effort?

79
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,550
Will you jump into your husband's arms without making yourself look pretty?

80
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,730
Today is the best day of your life.

81
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,990
You should dress up prettily and have a wonderful life being loved.

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,970
Goodness, you are so pretty.

83
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,960
Here.

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,010
Congratulations on your marriage.

85
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,300
If you look at these from far away, they look like chestnuts, too.

86
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,910
Gosh, you people...

87
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,470
You cannot have a wedding without alcohol.

88
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,760
I saw you fill that with water from the well.

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Be quiet!

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,470
Gosh, what are you guys doing?

91
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,430
The bridegroom must be getting impatient.

92
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,890
At this rate, when are they going to have their first night?

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,110
Here. Take this.

94
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,380
Then, the bridegroom and bride, bow to each other.

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,300
 The name "Hyun" was chosen by the child's father and mother 

96
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,530
 by putting their heads together on the day they found out he was in the womb. 

97
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,020
They chose his name to be "Hyun" as in kind, so that he would grow to be a kind person.

98
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,570
 That is your name. 

99
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,800
Why are you telling me about that child?

100
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,430
Is he a child that you know, Mother?

101
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,070
Next time, when the time comes,

102
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:46,670
I will tell you properly the story of that child and his parents one day.

103
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,660
For now, just know about it.

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,270
 If this is true, 

105
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,750
 would this not bring about another major bloodshed in the court? 

106
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,140
Could the son of Song really be him?

107
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,930
Was not the Grand Prince born after only eight months in the womb?

108
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,480
Your Highness, you must strengthen your resolve.

109
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,660
This is the last letter that Min Ho Seung left, so there is no way this is false.

110
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,070
You should think first of the nation, and abandon your personal feelings.

111
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,810
   

112
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,720
   

113
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,260
Supposedly, the Governor dug a hole under the furnace and hid the tombstone there.

114
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,470
If that stone comes to light,

115
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,960
everyone will know who the son of Song would be,

116
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,810
and that is why they killed the entire family of His Lordship.

117
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,850
Do you not think that Shim Young was looking for this

118
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,700
when he was searching through the whole house?

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Let us go to Gaeseong.

120
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,670
We must find and bring back that tombstone.

121
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,980
Yes, Your Highness.

122
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,890
Yes, Your Highness.

123
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,460
When you return from Gaeseong, inside and outside the Palace will be chaotic.

124
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,240
When you return with the tombstone that would be corroborative evidence, please give it to your father.

125
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,220
Yes, Your Highness.

126
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,350
 Eunuch Go, of the Eastern Palace, is Min Jae Yi, the daughter of Gaeseong's governor. 

127
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:43,800
 Why would the Queen give me this anonymous letter while saying it is merely the prank of court maids? 

128
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,000
Wait, this was a chest that opens?

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,380
- What was in it? 
  - Your Highness. 

130
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,410
Your Highness, you are here.

131
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,990
Why is this open? What happened to what was inside?

132
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,870
Was there something inside that?

133
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,950
Just a while ago, when Eunuch Go barged in looking for you, the chest was already open.

134
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,830
Soon Dol was looking for me?

135
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,940
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,750
For some unknown reason, he was in a rush looking for you.

137
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,230
He was in shock after seeing the chest open

138
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,190
and said a preposterous thing that the Crown Princess was in danger, then ran off.

139
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,530
So he went to the Royal Villa?

140
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,420
Your Highness!

141
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,190
Your Majesty.

142
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:32,240
I am sorry to tell you this, but the Crown Princess... has been assassinated.

143
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,960
What do you mean, assassinated?

144
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,300
Are you saying she died?

145
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,010
What are you doing!

146
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,970
Your Highness...

147
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,150
Let go of him.

148
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,010
Do you not know that he is a eunuch of the Eastern Palace?

149
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,520
How could you mistreat a servant of the Eastern Palace like this?

150
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,710
Tell me what is going on right now.

151
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,700
Your Highness, I was following the King's orders to arrest this man

152
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,480
and put him in the palace prison.

153
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,700
- What do you mean, arrest him? 
 - Your Highness,

154
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,980
the Crown Princess has been assassinated.

155
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,030
Also, he has already confessed to murdering the Crown Princess.

156
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,170
That cannot be.

157
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,490
What do you mean he confessed to it?

158
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,330
Tell me the truth.

159
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,210
What do you mean you assassinated the Crown Princess? Tell me the truth!

160
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,790
How could you give a false confession?

161
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,900
It is true, Your Highness.

162
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,990
I...

163
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,420
assassinated the Crown Princess.

164
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,550
All you who have ears, hear!

165
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,560
I am not Go Soon Dol!

166
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,890
Stop right there!

167
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,250
I am...

168
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,820
the murderer of Gaeseong, Min Jae Yi.

169
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,990
I poisoned my family

170
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,660
and entered the Eastern Palace under disguise to assassinate the Crown Prince,

171
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,040
and I assassinated the Crown Princess with the dagger I kept.

172
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,930
I am the murderer.

173
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,840
Show them the dagger.

174
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,660
They will be able to confirm that the dagger that was used to assassinate the Crown Princess was mine.

175
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,870
Show them the dagger that was used as the murder weapon.

176
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,130
It is this dagger.

177
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,280
It is his.

178
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,600
Your Highness, there are court maids who have witnessed the scene as well.

179
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,910
They said that this man suddenly barged into the Royal Villa, assassinated the Crown Princess,

180
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,870
and they saw her holding the dagger that was used to murder her.

181
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,920
I am sorry, but this person's arrest is the King's orders.

182
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,300
You cannot step in, Your Highness.

183
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,670
   

184
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,330
Bring me Court Lady Choi.

185
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,000
Since she was in charge of the Royal Villa to help the Crown Princess prepare for the ceremony,

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,030
tell Court Lady Choi to bring the court maids who witnessed what happened.

187
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,180
 Yes, Your Highness. 

188
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,200
 The only Foundation of the Nation for me is Crown Prince Ui Hyeon, 

189
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,140
 whom I served since his childhood. 

190
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,740
 The only thing I regret is dying before seeing Yi Hwan be dethroned 

191
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,900
 who caused his death. 

192
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,730
Gosh...

193
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,710
Have you changed her will?

194
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,390
Yes, I have done as you ordered.

195
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:54,310
 I will pay with my life for not protecting the Crown Princess from Go Soon Dol. 

196
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,650
Seeing the will that Court Lady Choi left behind,

197
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,680
is it not clear that Eunuch Go assassinated

198
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,500
the Crown Princess?

199
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,640
What did you say? Did I just mishear you?

200
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,260
She confessed to it herself, so the entire palace is in an uproar.

201
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,120
Did she really kill So Eun...

202
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,700
Then where is the Maiden right now?

203
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,140
She has been dragged to the palace prison.

204
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,510
- I will go to the palace prison. 
 - No, Sir!

205
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,570
Things may become dangerous for you as well, Sir.

206
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,950
She entered the palace under the disguise of a eunuch with plans to assassinate the Crown Prince,

207
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,490
and she is someone who assassinated the Crown Princess.

208
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,310
Right now, you must cut ties with this girl!

209
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,220
You are so wicked.

210
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,870
From a eunuch uniform to a woman's clothes...

211
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,910
Geez, how unlucky I am to see something like this.

212
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,840
 There is no way Jae Yi would have assassinated the Crown Princess. 

213
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,710
 Just a while ago, when Eunuch Go barged in looking for you, the chest was already open. 

214
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,390
 He was in shock after seeing the chest open 

215
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,750
 and said a preposterous thing that the Crown Princess was in danger, then ran off. 

216
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,370
 I am the murderer of Gaeseong, Min Jae Yi. 

217
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,970
 Jae Yi would have known that it was all a trap. 

218
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,450
 Also, if he came by here, 

219
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,930
 he would have known a long time ago that I was Min Jae Yi. 

220
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,760
 She realized that she could not hide it any longer, 

221
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,110
 so before my enemies could use this to attack me, 

222
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,880
 and before she ends up becoming my weakness, 

223
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,260
 she cut ties with me. 

224
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,930
 I entered the Eastern Palace under disguise to assassinate the Crown Prince, 

225
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,550
 and I assassinated the Crown Princess with the dagger I kept. 

226
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,810
 She confessed to entering the palace under disguise by herself 

227
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,510
 while everyone was watching. 

228
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,740
 So that... she could protect me. 

229
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,440
 Your Highness. 

230
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,130
 You must abandon me. 

231
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,700
 You must ignore me. 

232
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,360
 Please let me go, 

233
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,330
 and plan your future. 

234
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,520
 Min Jae Yi, 

235
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,140
 I will find a way 

236
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,940
 to save you, no matter what! 

237
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,440
Maiden Jae Yi is most likely not the murderer.

238
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,380
I have met her a few times while executing the orders of His Highness.

239
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,450
- She would not plan a risky and wicked thing– 
 - Yes.

240
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,460
That child... is not a murderer.

241
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,860
You already knew about

242
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,320
what happened with Maiden Jae Yi?

243
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,180
Your Majesty, please remove the Crown Prince from his position.

244
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,090
The Crown Prince, who should set an example to all the people as the Foundation of the Nation,

245
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,620
dared to bring in a woman, and

246
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,070
one who committed the crime of murdering her own family at that, into the palace where the King resides

247
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,400
and broke the law. Thus, how could you stay silent?

248
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,300
Your Majesty, she has already confessed to entering the palace to assassinate the Crown Prince.

249
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,630
Did she not confess falsely in order to protect the Crown Prince because she loves him?

250
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,560
Love? Are you saying that a girl who committed the crime of murdering her own family

251
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,270
dared to have such feelings for the Crown Prince?

252
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,990
That is not all, Your Majesty.

253
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,630
There is no one in the palace who does not know

254
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,770
that His Highness is especially partial to the Eunuch Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace.

255
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,060
Your Majesty, this is slander.

256
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,170
This is slander by those who want to misrepresent

257
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,550
the kindness and compassion shown by His Highness!

258
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,280
That is right, Your Majesty. This could never have happened.

259
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,460
That is right. This should never have happened.

260
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,020
To think that the Foundation of the Nation would be blinded by his love for a woman and break the laws of the palace!

261
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,580
Not only that,

262
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,620
- the woman has a fiance! 
 - Right State Minister!

263
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,170
How could you try to damage the authority and dignity of the royal family with your suspicions without any evidence?

264
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:20,590
Thus! Please interrogate her personally and reveal the truth for all to see, Your Majesty.

265
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,430
Since we cannot keep a serious criminal in the palace prison,

266
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,000
please transfer her to the Royal Investigation Bureau

267
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,850
to have her be flogged while you interrogate her,

268
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,040
so that she would never say anything false from her lips again.

269
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,700
Also, please expose and punish her for all of the crimes she has committed thus far,

270
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,180
so that everyone knows to fear and respect the laws of this land.

271
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,980
 Please listen to our plea. 

272
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,360
Your Majesty, that is not all.

273
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,600
For mocking the royal family by corrupting the crown princess selection, I wish to impeach

274
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,540
the Left State Minister, Han Joong Eon, for breaking the national laws.

275
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,260
Please listen to our plea.

276
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,690
 Please listen to our plea. 

277
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,650
Bring him in!

278
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,930
Your Majesty, he is a government slave of the Jangju Office, where the dead Crown Princess's family home is.

279
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,100
Tell him.

280
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,650
Please spare me.

281
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,790
All I did was secretly bury the dead body of the wife of His Lordship

282
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,350
about a month ago.

283
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,390
I just did so under orders by His Lordship

284
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,630
that no one must know about it.

285
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,000
Your Majesty,

286
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,200
Left State Minister Han Joong Eon and the Han family of Yeongsan fabricated the selection criteria

287
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,400
and tried to place a daughter who was ineligible to become Crown Princess.

288
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,800
 The Crown Princess has to come from the Han family of Yeongsan. 

289
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,590
 I cannot allow the Jo family of Seongju to become my in-law. 

290
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,520
 This is the Crown Prince's fortune reading. 

291
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,690
 Change the daughter of Han Joong Seop's fortune so it is compatible with this. 

292
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,060
Is this true, Left State Minister?

293
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,590
Your Majesty! Those who want to slander the Han family of Yeongsan and the Left State Minister are probably behind this!

294
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,370
It is true, Your Majesty.

295
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,250
Your Excellency!

296
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,310
It was the decision I made for the good of this court trying to stop the Jo family of Seongju

297
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,030
from amassing power as consort kin.

298
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,920
A decision for the good of the court? That is ridiculous!

299
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,320
Left State Minister Han Joong Eon showed contempt for the court and this nation.

300
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,790
Punish criminal Han Joong Eon for his crime!

301
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,470
 Punish criminal Han Joong Eon for his crime! 

302
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,500
Your Majesty, depose the Crown Prince, who broke the laws of the palace.

303
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,410
 Depose the Crown Prince. 

304
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,420
 Punish criminal Han Joong Eon for his crime! 

305
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,740
 Depose the Crown Prince. 

306
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,790
Your Highness, did you manage to solve the mystery of the coded message?

307
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,620
Is that what should be important for you right now?

308
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,240
When the interrogation is held soon, you will go through a torture

309
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,990
as terrible as the crime you have confessed to, with blood and flesh spattering, and your bones crushed.

310
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,850
How could you confess to a crime that you did not commit!

311
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,100
Do you really...not know the reason?

312
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,270
You have something you must do, Your Highness.

313
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,830
Another innocent person died.

314
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,710
Why do you think the Crown Princess died?

315
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,630
"Hwan Yi No Saeng. Dok Yi Woo Sa."

316
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,440
"You will grow old alone without a wife and will die lonely without any children."

317
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,560
It was so that they could fulfill the ghost's letter.

318
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,020
"The people will drag you down and depose you.

319
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,960
Everyone will turn their backs on you, and you will be alone."

320
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,140
They will not stop until they fulfill that curse.

321
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,180
You must stop them, Your Highness.

322
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,770
If you die,

323
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,670
if you are not by my side,

324
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,850
what meaning would all of this have for me?

325
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,220
You should expose everything, Your Highness.

326
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,870
The injustice that my family and I faced...Only you can do so, Your Highness.

327
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,310
Also, you should eventually rise to the throne,

328
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,410
and become a benevolent king to be remembered

329
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,480
just as my father had believed you would be.

330
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,670
Strengthen your resolve, Your Highness.

331
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,640
Do not look back on what is past,

332
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,780
and continue to forge forward.

333
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,400
That is all...

334
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,110
that I want for you.

335
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,640
I am sorry...that I am departing alone like this after giving you such a burden.

336
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,690
What do you mean, you will depart!

337
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,750
Do not say things like that.

338
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,660
I am not a bit afraid of dying.

339
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,730
My father, my mother, and my brother...

340
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,450
Since I am going to where those whom I miss are.

341
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,340
However, there is one thing...

342
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,630
that I would regret...

343
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,970
departing before I get to confess my love.

344
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,980
Were you not curious all this time

345
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,730
about who I was in love with?

346
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,540
I will only tell you, Your Highness.

347
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,730
The person I love is...

348
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,120
The one...

349
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,290
I keep... in my heart... is...

350
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,570
you, Your Highness.

351
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,300
How...

352
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,090
How could you tell me this only now?

353
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,150
I loved someone whom I should not love,

354
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,830
so I needed to keep my feelings to myself forever.

355
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,320
However,

356
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,810
I wanted to...

357
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:07,480
tell you... in the end, Your Highness.

358
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,690
I wanted to tell you

359
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,170
that while being able to meet and love you...

360
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,450
that my heart was full...and overwhelmingly happy.

361
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,470
I am sorry.

362
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,110
Do not forgive me... for being disrespectful...

363
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,870
and rude to the end.

364
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,360
Your Highness...

365
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,810
   

366
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,420
   

367
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,960
If Lady clears her name, do you think she will return here?

368
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
I do not know. Do you think she will want to return here?

369
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,090
What will you do?

370
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,830
You cannot return here.

371
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,260
- Why not? 
 - Did you not swear to me?

372
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,420
That you will be with your master forever?

373
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,680
 I, Myung Jin, will make Joseon even better. 

374
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,590
 I will accompany you. 

375
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,590
-  I will remain your student forever, Master.  
 -  Yes! 

376
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,690
Wait, how is that swearing an oath?

377
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,130
- That is swearing an oath! 
 - That was just...

378
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,980
If your master says it was a sworn oath, then it is!

379
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,290
- Gosh... 
 - Where is the kitchen?

380
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,530
We must find that tombstone first.

381
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,750
It is not on that side, but over there.

382
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,490
Oh, right. There is no way it is here. Let us go.

383
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,900
Come now. I was the one who received the secret mission from His Highness.

384
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,690
Pardon?

385
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,190
How dare you step in?

386
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,700
- I mean... 
 - All right, move aside.

387
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,410
Let us clear this out first... All right.

388
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,420
Okay, you just sit there

389
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,140
and watch while I carry out the secret mission.

390
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,950
My gosh! You have to push your hand in deeper.

391
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,120
Since it is something that he hid secretly, he would have hidden it deeper.

392
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,560
Gosh...

393
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,300
Push your hand in much deeper!

394
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,500
Think that you were going in all the way deep inside!

395
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,540
- It will be all the way deep inside. 
 - Geez...

396
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,900
I am sure I got it...

397
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,540
"The Yi family will perish, and a true man from the Song Family will soon appear

398
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,140
and start a new dynasty."

399
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,680
"Song Soo Cheon, Deceased June 25th in the year of the Red Dragon."

400
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,180
All right.

401
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,070
"Born on March 9th in the year of the Red Snake, Song Hyun."

402
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,120
Follow me.

403
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,510
Go to your private residence.

404
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,130
I will call for you again soon.

405
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,820
Kang,

406
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,980
if your twin has been frequenting the palace pretending to be you, he must know where you live, too.

407
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:43,080
If your twin visits you and you happen to hear something from him,

408
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,110
could you tell me what he said?

409
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,450
Yes, Your Highness. I will do that.

410
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,750
- Kang. 
 - I wish I could just tell you I am happy you are alive.

411
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,520
Is it true? Did you really shoot an arrow at His Highness,

412
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,400
kill the governor of Gaeseong's family, and release the red letter that curses the royal family, too?

413
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,700
You have been frequenting the palace looking just like me,

414
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,530
and did you really, Hyungnim...

415
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,480
Is it true that you did all that?

416
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I just followed the order to go back to my hometown.

417
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,800
The people you killed were innocent!

418
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,740
The people of Byeokcheon who died 10 years ago were innocent, too!

419
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,500
You have no idea... how the Byeokcheon people died that day.

420
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,640
Tell His Highness.

421
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,900
If you tell him what happened in Byeokcheon that day,

422
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,490
- he certainly will— 
 - I do not trust men in uniform.

423
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,080
Come to Gaeseong with me.

424
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,550
There is a place where the remaining people of our hometown live in.

425
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,050
I will go to Naean Village.

426
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,970
It is not easy to find that place since it is deep in the valley.

427
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,990
When the full moon rises,

428
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,470
come under the Zelkova tree halfway up Mt. Songak.

429
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,950
I will... be waiting for you.

430
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,480
- Hyungnim... 
 - You do not have to come right away.

431
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,550
Just remember that I will always be waiting for you there.

432
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,640
Your Majesty, Bureau of Archives, Office of Inspector General, and Office of Special Advisors jointly

433
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,400
sent you a letter to make an appeal to you. If you do not accept their appeal,

434
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,920
they are even considering protesting in front of the palace.

435
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,040
 Your Majesty, the Royal Secretaries are here! 

436
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,060
Let them in.

437
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,300
Your Majesty, these are public appeals from the Confucius scholars.

438
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,070
Your Majesty, Sungkyunkwan sent public appeals, too.

439
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,150
Naean Village?

440
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,970
They were living in Gaeseong, as I expected.

441
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,310
Were you not worried about your twin

442
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,990
when you were on your way to tell me about it?

443
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,560
You gave me an order.

444
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,470
I am just following your order.

445
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,490
The crime your twin committed

446
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,840
is quite serious.

447
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,950
He committed murders of innocent people.

448
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,620
He committed libel for framing an innocent person as a murderer.

449
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,380
He cursed the royal family and planned to start a rebellion. He even committed treason.

450
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,470
He deserves to...

451
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,890
pay for all of his crimes.

452
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,650
No matter what punishment Hyungnim receives,

453
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,670
it will be fair.

454
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,510
I have no doubt that you will judge fairly, Your Highness.

455
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,170
If so, would you trust me and

456
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,090
do as I say?

457
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,430
Of course, Your Highness.

458
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,400
How many people can you count on in Royal Bodyguard Unit?

459
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,710
Will you leave Maiden Jae Yi like that?

460
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,250
You know that she is innocent!

461
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,130
Will you really just sit and watch?

462
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,820
There are already tons of appeals asking to depose me.

463
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,250
I cannot even secure my position.

464
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,620
What power do I have?

465
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,950
Your Highness.

466
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,020
Do you not...

467
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,340
love Maiden Jae Yi?

468
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:59,690
Do you not know that she

469
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,890
loves you also?

470
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,610
Your Majesty.

471
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:18,910
I understand how disappointed you are as a father,

472
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,740
not to mention the leader of the country.

473
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,070
How could I not feel any pain telling you to

474
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,770
depose the Crown Prince?

475
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:34,000
However, this is not a matter of personal feelings.

476
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,010
The appeal letters... will keep flooding in.

477
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,660
I, Jo Won Bo, the Right State Minister

478
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,810
is asking you out of a strong sense of loyalty and desire to strengthen the country's future

479
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,140
by maintaining discipline and choosing

480
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,580
someone faultless as the crown prince.

481
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,590
Your Majesty!

482
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,600
Please...

483
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,630
depose the crown prince.

484
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,980
Please depose the crown prince

485
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,830
and choose the new crown prince

486
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,970
and strengthen the court and the nation!

487
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,930
Your Majesty.

488
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,800
 Father! 

489
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,520
 Please depose me! 

490
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,570
Father.

491
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,370
Please depose me.

492
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,130
I knew that Eunuch Go Soon Dol

493
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,270
was a woman.

494
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,280
My teacher's daughter asked me to let her prove her innocence.

495
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,350
So I kept her by my side.

496
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,880
However...

497
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:12,180
how could I not know that... it was a particularly disruptive crime to ethics and customs?

498
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,650
I already am...

499
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,360
disqualified as the crown prince.

500
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Father, please stop forgiving me

501
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,580
and depose me!

502
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,320
 Father! 

503
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,060
 Please depose me! 

504
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,510
 I am a sinner! 

505
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,040
Father!

506
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,990
Please depose me!

507
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,870
I am a sinner!

508
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,940
 He is trying to give up on being 

509
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,370
 the crown prince for a mere woman? 

510
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,780
 Does Crown Prince... truly love that woman? 

511
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,500
Father.

512
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,000
Please depose me.

513
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,630
Please depose me.

514
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:19,170
Father.

515
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,410
Please depose me!

516
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,410
 I made up my mind by listening to the people's voices 

517
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,540
 that is as important as Heaven's will. 

518
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,030
 I will depose Crown Prince Yi Hwan. 

519
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,120
How dare you try to stop us?

520
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,260
Move aside.

521
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,660
I will see my brother.

522
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,370
Hyungnim!

523
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,510
Hyungnim! Please do not leave the palace!

524
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,010
You cannot, Hyungnim!

525
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,560
Hyungnim!

526
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,950
His Highness the Crown Prince!

527
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,350
 His Highness! 

528
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,630
His Highness the Crown Prince!

529
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,590
 Crown Prince colluded with Min Jae Yi, the murderer 

530
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,270
 and committed a sin by making her enter the Eastern Palace 

531
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,940
 by disguising her as a eunuch. 

532
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,750
 Your Highness! 

533
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,810
 This disrupts the moral principles 

534
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,200
 and it is a sin that the Heavens and the country cannot forgive. 

535
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,780
 The deposed crown prince will leave the palace immediately 

536
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,630
 and live quietly on Ganghwa Island. 

537
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,930
 Left State Minister, Han Joong Eon 

538
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:39,050
 hid the fact that Han So Eun's mother passed 

539
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,530
 and applied for the selection, which is a major crime. 

540
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,600
 He deserves to be punished by exterminating his whole family, 

541
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,240
 but considering the fact that he recognizes his sin 

542
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,210
 and he did it for his loyalty to the court and the nation, 

543
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,310
 he will be removed from his position, 

544
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,090
 imprisoned in his house, not allowed to leave the house ,

545
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,490
 and soldiers will be assigned to keep him imprisoned. 

546
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,480
 Min Jae Yi confessed to killing her parents, 

547
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,450
 her brother, and the Crown Princess. 

548
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,300
 Since the evidence is clear, 

549
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,140
 she will be beheaded. 

550
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,800
If so, what will happen to his son, Sergeant?

551
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,780
It says right here.

552
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,290
His family is not implicated.

553
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,020
Implicated? So I am asking, what does that mean?

554
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,280
His son, the Sergeant, will not be punished and

555
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,590
the father is the only person to be punished for his crime. That is what it means.

556
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,410
I see! Rice and soup separated?

557
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,690
Rice and soup separated?

558
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:39,910
It is like the rice and soup are separated.

559
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,440
I think he means they will be punished individually.

560
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,590
My gosh...

561
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,720
Okay.

562
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,020
Crown Prince.

563
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,650
Now,

564
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,120
the whole world will turn its back on you

565
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,970
and you will be left alone.

566
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:16,050
 Soon, you will go crazy and roam around the eight provinces alone. 

567
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,380
You will roam around this chaotic world alone and disappear.

568
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,310
Nothing will fix this.

569
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,160
Do not try to do anything.

570
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,170
Your destiny has to end

571
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,210
with death only.

572
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,770
It was almost complete.

573
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,600
Why was Sergeant left out–

574
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,270
Why do I find this annoying?

575
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,500
It will not be bad for us.

576
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,430
You are right.

577
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,310
The sergeant is Min Jae Yi's betrothed.

578
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,000
His family was ruined because of Crown Prince, too.

579
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,480
How could he have a good feeling toward the Crown Prince?

580
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,520
None of that matters.

581
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,990
Before Crown Prince arrives on Ganghwa Island,

582
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,740
I will kill him.

583
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,900
I heard you would be taking Crown Prince to Ganghwa Island.

584
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,510
Yes.

585
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,670
Please give it to him when you get to Ganghwa Island.

586
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,240
What is this?

587
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,660
I prepared medicinal tea since I thought he would get thirsty during his travel.

588
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,830
I am hoping that as Crown Prince leaves here,

589
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:48,410
he forgets all of his pain

590
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,450
and finds peace.

591
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,610
It is a tea that reflects my heart.

592
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,720
Right State Minister wishes to see you.

593
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,040
I am so sorry about

594
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,730
what happened to your family.

595
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,770
But as someone who works for the country,

596
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,350
I know there is no one as good as your father.

597
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:32,910
So I am even considering reinstating Left State Minister.

598
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,400
You are not planning to stay as a sergeant, are you?

599
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,660
Is there something you want from me?

600
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,710
You...

601
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,680
will be escorting the deposed Crown Prince.

602
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,580
Before the deposed Crown Prince arrives on Ganghwa Island,

603
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,400
I want you to end his life.

604
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,040
As for my father, he is already getting punished by the King.

605
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,110
How could I turn that around?

606
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,120
The Crown Prince's seat is left empty.

607
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,320
Who will end up sitting there?

608
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,510
It will be Grand Prince Myeong Ahn.

609
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,050
As long as you follow my order,

610
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,780
I will make sure to keep the promise.

611
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,240
I will...

612
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,020
follow your order.

613
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:39,270
But how can we just verbally promise something so important?

614
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:43,490
Please write a statement that we are in this together

615
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,820
and sign it.

616
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,150
   

617
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,960
 Your Majesty! Chief Royal Secretary is here! 

618
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:50,110
Your Majesty, the deposed Crown Prince and his entourage just left the palace.

619
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:54,760
Father, will you really drive out Orabeoni like this?

620
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,930
You cannot!

621
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:23,420
 "Dong Ja Bae Do Woo Ja Hyang Gum." 

622
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,560
 "Your friend will turn his back and point a sword at your back." 

623
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,910
 "Man Ok Dang Ying Yeo Ji Hyo." 

624
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:58,220
 "Many will be killed 

625
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,820
 as a result of your foolishness." 

626
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,500
Protect the deposed Crown Prince!

627
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,760
Run!

628
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,840
Did you forget?

629
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,230
He left the life of the deposed Crown Prince, Yi Hwan, in my hands.

630
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,680
Please forgive my rudeness, Your Highness.

631
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,230
You must run away quickly.

632
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,050
Protect the woman, Your Highness.

633
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,840
You should also find a way to protect your position.

634
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,870
Do you not resent me?

635
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,590
That woman came to me...

636
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,140
but I did not send her to you.

637
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,690
I did resent you.

638
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,600
If you had told me about her sooner,

639
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,350
your heart would have felt much lighter.

640
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,030
You would not have had to carry all the burden on your own.

641
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,360
Do you really think that way?

642
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,470
Did you forget?

643
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,880
I told you that I never stopped being your friend.

644
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,910
For you,

645
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,030
I will risk my life to save Maiden Jae Yi and protect your position.

646
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,140
Let go!

647
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,310
Let go, you bastard!

648
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,520
Put me down! Let go!

649
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,300
Let go of me!

650
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,850
You do not even know me! Where are you taking me to?

651
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,800
Let go! Let go of me!

652
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,100
Let go of me!

653
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,190
It is me, Guardian Warrior.

654
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:47,760
It is His Highness' order. He told me to bring you to him.

655
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:04,470
His Highness sent you to me?

656
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:09,710
Then... did you really think he would let you die like this?

657
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,090
You did not even know I came to save you.

658
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,460
That temper of yours...

659
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,900
You should have said so.

660
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,050
A stranger came to me with a sword.

661
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,080
How could I do nothing? I could...

662
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,580
- I could never— 
 - "I could never put up with it!"

663
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,800
Yes, I know you cannot put up with anything.

664
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:31,140
It is really you, Guardian Warrior.

665
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,800
Oh, my! What an eyesore!

666
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,960
I have never seen a woman who does not suit–

667
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,650
women's clothes.

668
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,300
I have never seen one.

669
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,380
How about His Highness? What happened to him?

670
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,330
I deposed the Crown Prince as they wanted.

671
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,090
Are there more letters of appeal?

672
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,690
Your Majesty, it is truly upsetting

673
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,540
that the crown prince's seat is empty.

674
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:08,500
Are these the appeals demanding Grand Prince to become the crown prince, then?

675
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,470
 Father, I would like to see you and Left State Minister 

676
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:20,060
 in private at my library tomorrow night. 

677
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,030
Your Majesty, please depose Crown Prince and remove me.

678
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,140
How could I remove you and depose Crown Prince?

679
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,300
It is to trick them.

680
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,790
I will beg in front of your quarters asking you to depose me tonight.

681
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:37,270
Please remove me

682
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,780
from my position as they want, as well.

683
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:43,280
Before we find out about the Jo family of Seongju's crimes,

684
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,010
you must save the people from Byeokcheon.

685
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:49,060
You must let them know that you wish to hear their complaints of injustice

686
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,920
and relieve their resentments.

687
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,140
I will go to Naean Village without them noticing.

688
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:01,720
We must let them live as good people in this country again.

689
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,310
Are you saying the deposed Crown Prince and Sergeant disappeared?

690
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,230
How about that wench?

691
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,920
What happened to the woman who was sent to the execution site?

692
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,150
Send someone to Royal Investigation Bureau immediately and find out where she is.

693
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,480
Did she disappear, too?

694
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,620
Thank you for coming all the way here.

695
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,740
Are you all right, Your Highness?

696
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,670
Where should we go now?

697
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,030
We will go to...

698
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,390
Naean Village now.

699
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,220
What were you doing, exactly?

700
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,660
Looks like you do not need money for your daughter's medicine anymore.

701
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,120
Do you want to die with your daughter?

702
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,000
- Is that it? 
 - Your Excellency!

703
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,990
Please spare me!

704
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,140
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

705
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,200
Hyungnim! We are in trouble!

706
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,930
That man! S-Sungnyemun Gate!

707
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:20,810
That Hong Je Yong!

708
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:24,060
 I was wondering where I have seen him and... 

709
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,390
I am Hong Je Yong. I led the rebellion!

710
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:28,860
Kill me!

711
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,500
- Other people are innocent. 
 - Hit him!

712
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,900
 That Hong Je Yong from Byeokcheon! 

713
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,800
I saw him in Jangtongbang!

714
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,930
Go to Jangtongbang and bring him over immediately!

715
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,340
Yes, His Excellency!

716
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,860
He looks like a garlic bulb.

717
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,390
He ran into me before, so I am sure someone saw him in the market!

718
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,820
There must be someone who knows where he lives!

719
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,150
Go! Go!

720
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,320
Hey... Is it you, Man Deok?

721
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,850
Do you know the people who used to do business here?

722
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,890
Yes.

723
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,140
I have not seen them in a few days.

724
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:19,210
He suddenly disappeared overnight with his wife and their children.

725
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,440
Do you know his name?

726
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,560
Why are you suddenly asking me his name–

727
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,480
Just answer my question!

728
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,980
Were there people who were close to them?

729
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,800
O-O-Over there...

730
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,400
   

731
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,790
One!

732
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,790
 One! 

733
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,140
Two!

734
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,930
 Two! 

735
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,160
Three!

736
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,360
 Three! 

737
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,540
Is this Naean Village?

738
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,690
Will we be living here from now on?

739
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,710
People of Byeokcheon hid out here

740
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,940
and named this place Naean Village.

741
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,980
"Naean. 
  (T/N: Or Nae-wang) 

742
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,740
Which means "Come and go."

743
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,830
Naean Village is a temporary place.

744
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,650
We will make sure to return to our hometown!

745
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,080
Two!

746
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,910
 Two! 

747
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,270
So the couple at the tavern were from Byeokcheon?

748
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,190
They mentioned that the people of Byeokcheon

749
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,200
shipped a lot of products to Gaeseong.

750
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,390
When I heard that,

751
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,920
I remembered that they shipped stuff to their hometown!

752
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,890
I stopped by the tavern when I was delivering the tombstone.

753
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,520
But they were already gone with Dal Rae and Meo Roo.

754
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,120
They must have gone to Naean Village, too.

755
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,900
The real culprit who killed Crown Princess

756
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,840
must be one of the twins...

757
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:02,010
He did not return to the palace since then.

758
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,120
It is Court Lady Choi of the Eastern Palace.

759
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,100
How could Court Lady Choi do that...

760
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,320
Was she from Byeokcheon, too?

761
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,670
Court Lady Choi served my late brother for a long time.

762
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,750
She should have left the palace long ago,

763
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,310
but I requested that she stay at the Eastern Palace.

764
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,970
If so, she must have believed the rumor

765
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:25,360
that you gave a peach to Crown Prince Ui Hyeon to assassinate him.

766
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:31,200
The enemies must have approached her because they recognized her resentment.

767
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,290
So the one who delivered the ghost's letter was also–

768
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:37,130
The ghost's letter? What is that?

769
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,570
I received this three years ago.

770
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,490
   

771
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,860
What a horrible curse...

772
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,910
Hong Je Yong and his wife of Byeokcheon

773
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,850
apparently were close with the people from Manyeondang that I told you about before.

774
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,220
So when I searched Manyeondang, 
    

775
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,600
I found those things. 
    

776
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,660
D-Do you mean the people of Byeokcheon

777
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,110
were behind all this?

778
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:19,200
I think the deposed Crown Prince and the Manyeondang people were after them.

779
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,700
Also, this was found at Manyeondang.

780
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,050
 That pinwheel letter you wrote. 

781
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,830
If the pretty scholars and the people from Manyeondang find it,

782
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,520
they would come here to see us, right?

783
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,440
Be quiet!

784
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,710
Father and Mother said that this place was a secret.

785
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,120
 We are leaving for a place called Naean Village. 

786
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,230
 The people from our hometown live by Mt. Songak in Gaeseong. 

787
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,920
 We will miss you a lot. 

788
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,130
 Please visit us at Naean Village someday. 

789
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:59,660
The deposed Crown Prince and that woman must have gone to Naean Village, too.

790
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,230
H-Hyungnim!

791
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,830
If the Crown Prince finds out the truth about Byeokcheon, we will...

792
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,910
Do you remember what Park Han Soo said once?

793
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,340
He said the woman of the Song family is alive.

794
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,100
He said she left this house and went inside a carriage.

795
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,580
Do you have... any idea who that might be?

796
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,600
Wh-What kind of bizarre nonsense is that now?

797
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,330
 H-How did a woman from the Song family... 

798
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,140
 c-come out of Hyungnim's house... 

799
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,270
 and why would she get inside a carriage? 

800
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,250
   

801
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,080
   

802
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,600
That wench is...

803
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,160
That wench dared to...

804
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:04,160
You...

805
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,650
You wench!

806
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:29,380


807
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:40,370
   

808
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,880
 Grand Prince must become the Crown Prince 

809
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,440
 and rise to the throne. 

810
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,910
 Stop! The new Crown Prince needs to rise to the throne, 

811
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:50,020
 so the people of Byeokcheon can return to their hometown! 

812
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,010
 How can we possibly relieve... 

813
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:56,730
 our resentments of ten years? 

814
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,390
 One's heart needs to be expressed by their actions. 

815
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:02,110
 You understand my heart, too. 

816
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,300
 I am the Crown Prince of Joseon. 

817
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,810
 Do you think things will work out the way you want?
