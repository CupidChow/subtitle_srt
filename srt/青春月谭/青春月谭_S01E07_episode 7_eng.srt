1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
   

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,360
   

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,240
   

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,540
   

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,380
   

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,980
   

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,000
   

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,940
   

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:44,060


10
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,060
Are these dried peonies?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
 What is that smell? 

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,930
 Did my mother burn them? 

13
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,770
Did I... see the peonies

14
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,810
in the kitchen then?

15
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,970
 Try to remember what happened that day soon. 

16
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,910
 You must remember what happened that day. 

17
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,760
 You can do it. 

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,270
 What is the memory that I am missing? 

19
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,680
 Something that I overlooked... 

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,190
 A minor thing that I have forgotten... 

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,250
 Sister... 

22
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,590
That is right! Young had come!

23
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,600
 Was everything she told me a lie? 

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,910
 On the day an arrow flew at me at the military training hunting grounds, 

25
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,700
 I met Min Jae Yi. 

26
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,130
 - Was the one who shot the arrow at me 
 - That was not mine. 

27
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,190
 really Min Jae Yi? 

28
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,980
 The celebratory message at the hunting grounds was trickery. 

29
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,410
 Is it not strange how she knew right away the deception of the celebratory message? 

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,430
 Without a secret letter from you, 

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,670
 how could I know what was written in that letter from a ghost? 

32
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,480
 Is Min Jae Yi on the same side as the one who sent the secret letter? 

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
 No. 

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,580
 She is not. 

35
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,390
 None of that makes sense. 

36
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,880
 Even if the ones who sent the secret letter and Min Jae Yi are on the same side, 

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,600
 there is no reason for her to kill her own family. 

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,310
 Still, 

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,330
 I cannot keep her by my side. 

40
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,740
Bring Soon Dol here immediately.

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,690
Pardon? Why Go Soon Dol...

42
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,450
Bring him over.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,650
Bring that man in front of me right now.

44
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,260
Do you not hear my order? Bring Go Soon Dol to me right now!

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,640
 Young had visited me in the kitchen that day. 

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,450
 If I tell His Highness, 

47
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,750
 he may find the answer! 

48
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,280
He comes running toward his own death.

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,070
Why are you doing this?

50
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,700
What is the matter? Please let go of me as we walk!

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,830
Let go...

52
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,270
Your Highness, your Guardian Warrior is here.

53
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,960
Your Highness, I have brought him here per your order.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,770
Leave the room, Kang.

55
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,380
And tell the other palace workers to go out as well.

56
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,240
Yes, I will do as you ordered.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,650
Your Highness, what is the matter–

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,540
Did you exchange this with that man as a token of love?

59
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,960
No.

60
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,950
This is not a token of love.

61
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,030
He was sad that I was going far away for marriage,

62
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,450
so it was a token of being sworn siblings—

63
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,230
There was nothing false with the records.

64
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,850
Your words were false. All of it was false.

65
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:48,480
I will not believe anything that comes out of your mouth.

66
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,120
Your Highness... how could you do this to me...

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,460
Did you not say you believed me?

68
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,600
Read it for yourself. It is a letter you should read.

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,590
 My beloved Jae Yi. 

70
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,330
 I am sorry that I could not run away with you and get married. 

71
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,930
 I am also sorry for betraying your trust. 

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,420
 There is nothing that made me 

73
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,340
 feel happier and hurt me more 

74
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,090
 than the love you gave me. 

75
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,580
 The love that I could not give you here, I will repay in heaven. 

76
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,050
 I love you as much as you love me. 

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,340
"Repay me in heaven?"

78
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,770
Your Highness, how did this letter come to me?

79
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,240
This is not true! Your Highness, this is not true!

80
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,750
Your Highness, you must believe me.

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,260
How could Young do this to me...?

82
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,410
Shut your mouth!

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,050
It is the last word left behind by a man before ending his life.

84
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,350
It is a last will.

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,760
How could there be any lies in the last will, left behind by a man

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,170
who hung himself in the house of the woman he loved?

87
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,120
Tell me.

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,870
Explain yourself. From what to what was a lie?

89
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,690
The secret letter would have also been a lie.

90
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,540
The arrow shot at me, and the defiled celebratory message at the military training hunt...

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,090
Are they all not your doing?

92
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,680
That is not true!

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,910
- Your Highness, that's not true. I– 
 - I will not listen to you!

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,800
What good will it do me to keep listening to your lies?

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,000
It is all useless.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,130
Whether it is true or not that you tried to elope with your secret lover and murdered your family,

97
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,030
it has nothing to do with me now.

98
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,940
- Your Highness... 
 - Listen!

99
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,690
Is nobody out there? Is nobody out there?

100
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,830
What is the matter? Why is everyone outside-

101
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,840
 I asked if there was nobody out there! 

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,080
Did you call us, Your Highness...

103
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Drag Go Soon Dol out immediately.

104
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,410
Your Highness... Please listen to what I have to say just once!

105
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,170
Your Highness... Please listen to what I have to say just once!

106
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,860
Do not dare to step foot into the Eastern Palace ever again.

107
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,310
It is not true. It is not true, Your Highness!

108
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,290
You must believe me, Your Highness!

109
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,980
Please listen to me just once!

110
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,440
Your Highness... Your Highness!

111
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,730
Geez.

112
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,830
Serves you right.

113
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,950
Someone who entered the Eastern Palace so easily was bound to get cut at a moment's notice!

114
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,340
Do not dare to step foot in the Eastern Palace again!

115
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,620
Gosh!

116
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,390
For today, leave the palace and sleep in your private residence,

117
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,810
and go to the Eunuch's Bureau outside of the palace tomorrow morning.

118
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,550
I will let them know.

119
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,800
I am sorry...

120
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,740
 For what reason did His Highness take his will? 

121
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,690
 Since when was His Highness chasing after that incident? 

122
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,450
But, Sir, there is one more thing.

123
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,840
Supposedly, the Lady's servant girl also disappeared.

124
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,700
I believe she may have run away with the Lady.

125
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,520
Her name is Ga Ram, and she is Jang Chi Soo's cousin.

126
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,540
Find her. We must at least find that servant girl.

127
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,050
Yes.

128
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,130
   

129
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,640
Right. Where is your home?

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,020
It is in Han Bat Village.

131
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,620
You should go home earlier next time.

132
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,310
Is there any way to contact Eunuch Go?

133
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,050
There is no way for us to contact him first.

134
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,260
Are you worried about him?

135
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,830
Did I not tell you? Eunuch Go is not that hurt.

136
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,980
Yes.

137
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,940
It appears that you are still concerned for him.

138
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,360
It appears I have grown fond of him already.

139
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,970
A new wanted poster seems to be up.

140
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,900
You should not take one down again, Teacher!

141
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,070
Why? What does it say?

142
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,460
That is why I said you need to learn to read! Since you cannot read notices like these,

143
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,200
you would not even know what is happening in the world. Is that not frustrating?

144
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Gosh, all right. I will learn. So what does it say?

145
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,250
But this face looks very familiar.

146
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,270
It appears one of the servant girls from the Governor of Gaeseong's house disappeared,

147
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,970
and there is an order for her capture and return.

148
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,870
   

149
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,280
Supposedly, it is a servant girl named Jang Ga Ram. Wait...

150
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,830
Upon closer look, she looks like you a bit.

151
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,480
How do we look anything alike? I am a man.

152
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,140
Are you upset because I said you look like a woman?

153
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,420
Maiden Jae Yi's whereabouts are still unknown, but it appears that case

154
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,110
was closed with the Maiden Jae Yi as the culprit.

155
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,800
In Joseon, the crime of killing your family carries the heaviest penalty.

156
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,900
I guess her home will soon be destroyed.

157
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,290
What do you mean by that?

158
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,310
It is when the house of someone who killed one's family or committed treason is destroyed,

159
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,720
and a hole is dug there and made into a pond.

160
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,050
The remaining servants would become government servants.

161
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,500
So I wonder why she ran away...

162
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,390
By chance, do you think that servant girl is with Maiden Jae Yi?

163
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,510
If she is not alone, but together...

164
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,010
then it may have been easier for them to live in hiding, depending on each other. Do you not think so, my student?

165
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,670
Yes...

166
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,900
Well... what happens to the servant who runs away?

167
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,160
Since she broke the law, she would be punished. A runaway servant is punished by branding.

168
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,490
For male servants, they are branded with 'male servant' on the left cheek,

169
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,460
and for female servants, they are branded with 'female servant' on the right cheek,

170
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,430
so that they would never dare run away again-

171
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,680
Why are you being like this? Seeing how your face is so pale...

172
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,410
How could there be such a terrible punishment?

173
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,060
That is true. I mean, I think that it is terrible as well.

174
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,040
Gosh. What can we do?

175
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,430
That is what the national law says.

176
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,530
 Young. 

177
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,020
 How could you die... And a suicide at that... 

178
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,570
 Why did Young... leave such a suicide note? 

179
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,310
 Why did Young come to the kitchen that day? 

180
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,910
 And how come 

181
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,110
 I cannot remember 

182
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,470
 what we talked about there? 

183
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,220
I am going to die of frustration!

184
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,060
I feel like I have become an imbecile...

185
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,440
Why did you come here when you were kicked out of the Eastern Palace?

186
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,760
I have my things to pick up from inside.

187
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,860
You were empty-handed when you arrived here. So go empty-handed when you leave.

188
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,270
It is an important item. I will only take just a moment.

189
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,990
Everything in here belongs to His Highness. Be gone!

190
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,360
Then please tell His Highness

191
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,100
that there is an important item inside that came from the house of the head shaman.

192
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,440
Please tell His Highness to take a close look at it.

193
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,150
I do not know. I have always been quite annoyed by you.

194
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,640
Why would I deliver the message of someone who got kicked out of the Eastern Palace to His Highness?

195
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,610
Tell him yourself if you can find a way.

196
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,270
Live well. Or return to being a fifth-degree soldier.

197
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,110
For some reason, his spirit seems broken...

198
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,520
"I will remember this!" "I will not give up!"

199
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,920
I thought he would come at me saying that.

200
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,200
I wonder what happened all of a sudden.

201
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,230
Well, whatever the reason was, is it not good that Go Soon Dol was kicked out of the Eastern Palace?

202
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,550
I feel like a weight is off my shoulders. It feels great! Do you not feel the same way?

203
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,300
I mean, I do, but...

204
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,040
Gosh, what is with you?

205
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,770
I feel like we got rid of him without getting our hands dirty.

206
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,370
 Min Jae Yi, I had trusted you. 

207
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,180
 I... needed someone I could trust. 

208
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,080
 I depended on you. 

209
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,660
 You were the one 

210
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,530
 I have waited for a long time. 

211
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,220
   

212
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,100
 How is your arm? Is there any improvement? 

213
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,990
 We managed to pull out the poison, and the wound has healed, 

214
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,600
 but there is something to show you, Father. 

215
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,820
 Try lifting your right arm. 

216
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,180
 Never mind. 

217
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,970
 I am sorry to cause you concern, Father. 

218
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,130
 According to the physician- 

219
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,850
 I heard that your arm might never return to its original form. 

220
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,150
 The Crown Prince of this nation cannot be someone disabled. 

221
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,210
 Then, Father, what will you do with me? 

222
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,470
 With all the horrible rumors about you out there, there is no reason for me not to depose you 

223
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,400
 if you cannot even use your arm. 

224
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,100
 Before I am your servant, Father, I am your son. 

225
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,290
 What must I do about the horrible rumors and my already injured arm? 

226
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,900
 You must not let anyone see your arm, which you cannot move. 

227
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,110
 However, Physician Park, who treated my arm, already knows about it. 

228
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,780
 Physician Park died yesterday on his way home from the palace at the hands of a drunk gambler. 

229
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,410
 So nobody knows the condition of your arm. 

230
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:20,400
 Thus, from now on, you must take care of your own arm. 

231
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,710
 Was that drunk gambler someone you sent- 

232
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,790
 What will you do if he were? Give up your sympathy and benevolence. 

233
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,720
 Your position right now is not one you can keep being swayed by personal feelings. 

234
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,200
 It has only been two years since Crown Prince Ui Hyeon died. 

235
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,520
 What will happen if it becomes known that the position of the Crown Prince is shaky again? 

236
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,230
 Those guys wearing the official hats will take turns coming to me 

237
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,120
 telling me to get rid of the disabled Crown Prince, bringing a petition to me every day. 

238
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,490
 After... I lost a son, 

239
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,430
 must I now also lose my son, who is alive? 

240
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,250
 I am the son of a lowly palace water maid. 

241
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,030
 And you are the grandson of a lowly palace water maid. 

242
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,170
 We have... no one. 

243
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,890
 Those men who are bowing before us under the guise of being our servants have for generations... 

244
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,030
 Those men who have maintained for generations a noble family line 

245
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,250
 will never forget that fact 

246
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,780
 and look upon us with coldness. 

247
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,580
 If you cannot keep your position, you will die that very day. 

248
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,530
 Do not trust anyone.No one. 

249
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,940
 At times, you should not even trust me, your father. 

250
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,570
 In order for me to keep my position, I must consider the court and the nation 

251
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,710
 rather than personal feelings. 

252
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,780
 I also do not trust anyone. 

253
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,510
 If you want to survive in this palace, you must do so. 

254
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,240
 Did your masters and officials tell you 

255
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,490
 to become a king based on benevolence and virtue? 

256
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,960
 That is correct. 

257
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,470
 However, if you want to be benevolent and virtuous, you must first survive. 

258
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,050
 Survive at all costs 

259
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,210
 and keep your own position by yourself. 

260
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,110
 I thought that you were the one I have been waiting for, Min Jae Yi. 

261
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,770
 I believed that person had come to me. 

262
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,190
Go Soon Dol of the Eastern Palace.

263
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you not a eunuch who works long-term in the palace?

264
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,110
Where are you going at this hour?

265
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,210
It is the order of His Highness.

266
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,940
Go ahead.

267
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,310
 Gaeseong's murderer, Min Jae Yi... 

268
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,770
 Because it was you, Min Jae Yi... 

269
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,580
 who were being chased for a bloody crime, 

270
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,920
 and yet managed to survive tenaciously and came to where I was... 

271
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,750
 I trusted you because it was you. 

272
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,600
 For me, holding out alone deep in the Palace, 

273
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,690
 you were like a ray of light 

274
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,330
 that helped me to see a new world. 

275
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,800
 I will be by Your Highness' side! 

276
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,990
 Your Highness, I will protect you. 

277
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,490
 I believed your promise. 

278
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,260
 But, was that... 

279
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,880
 really all a lie? 

280
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,650
   

281
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,340
If Maiden Jae Yi is really alive, and so

282
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:35,720
if this servant girl is also with her, where would they be?

283
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,130
 A runaway servant is punished by branding. 

284
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,370
 For male servants, they are branded with 'male servant' on the left cheek, 

285
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,320
 and for female servants, they are branded with 'female servant' on the right cheek, 

286
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,600
 so that they would never dare run away again. 

287
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,280
Hold her down tight.

288
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,150
   

289
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,330
 Is anyone inside? 

290
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,060
- Who's there? 
 - Is this the house of Jang Chi Soo of Choongmuheo?

291
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,950
It is.

292
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,030
Why are you looking for Jang Chi Soo?

293
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,240
We came to search for his female cousin.

294
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,870
Who are you?

295
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,570
It's me! I am Jang Chi Soo!

296
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,960
Is your female cousin the servant girl in the house of the Governor of Gaeseong, named Jang Ga Ram?

297
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,430
She is. But why are you searching for my female cousin?

298
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
Oh, goodness!

299
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,120
Did that bitch disappear by chance?

300
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,790
That bitch, Jang Ga Ram, would never come here.

301
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,890
We have been like enemies since we were young!

302
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,390
Since a capture-and-return order is out for her, you must notify us if she ever comes here.

303
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,230
All right.

304
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,990
Who are you? Show me your identity tag!

305
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,340
M-My identity tag!

306
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,510
H-He came to collect money from me!

307
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,990
D-Did I not say I will repay you?

308
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,900
Wh-When are you going to repay me?

309
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,420
Gosh, I will pay you.

310
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,990
Gosh, you are so cheap! Fine, I will pay you right now.

311
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,390
First, come inside!

312
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,730
He borrowed five nyang from me and he did not repay me...

313
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,000
Let us go.

314
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,600
Yes, have a safe trip. Yes...

315
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,110
Why are the officials looking for you?

316
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,960
Did not the Gaeseong case end with the Lady's death?

317
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,660
Orabeoni...

318
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,260
What do I do... Supposedly...

319
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,180
a capture-and-return order is out for me...

320
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,980
A capture-and-return order...

321
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,260
   

322
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,200
If you come to me, I could protect you.

323
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,110
My goodness, the student of Manyeondang is here.

324
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,330
You are out early.

325
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,380
Gosh, why have you come so early?

326
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,470
The morning bell has not even rung yet.

327
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,730
Is it not the same for you two as well?

328
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,700
I came early to do some cleaning.

329
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,380
Yeah. You are right. It is best to be diligent.

330
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,330
But what is with the rice bags?

331
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,790
Oh, it is rice to send to our hometown.

332
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,960
This much?

333
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,150
Do you have a lot of family members back home?

334
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,480
That is why this guy is so stingy. He would not even buy me a sock!

335
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,940
Gosh, we should quickly make money and go back to our hometown.

336
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,160
Are you not going to go? Then I suppose I will go by myself.

337
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,130
Oh, did you hurt your arm?

338
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,650
Well, he got hurt while in the mountains.

339
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,540
- I told you to be careful...
 - I am fine.

340
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,930
It will heal soon.

341
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,900
Please be careful. Then, I will be on my way.

342
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,120
Did a dead body come in during the night?

343
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,770
Gosh, Teacher should have at least notified me that a dead body was inside!

344
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,280
What do I do? Do I go back home?

345
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,650
No, no. Even scaredy-cat Myung Jin is not afraid of it.

346
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,820
So how can brave Ga Ram be afraid of it?

347
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,280
So, how did you end up dying?

348
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,660
First, I will take a look at you.

349
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,020
Spare me! Please!

350
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,720
- I did not do anything! 
 - Are you still afraid of dead bodies?

351
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,280
Lady...

352
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,220
Lady!

353
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,410
Do you know how worried I was?

354
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,620
Geez... your fair forehead...

355
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,520
Are you hurt anywhere else?Did you get proper medical treatment? Did you?

356
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I'm fine. Do not worry.

357
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,860
But why did you sleep here?

358
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,880
What time is it right now?What if I am late?

359
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,010
I am supposed to go to the Eunuch Bureau starting today.

360
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,060
Gosh, it is still early morning!

361
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,260
It is still dark outside.

362
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,700
I will make you the mukbap you like, so eat it before you go. Please?

363
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,510
Your Highness. Are you awake?

364
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't think he slept at all.

365
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,830
The light has not gone out all night.

366
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,290
Are you saying he was awake all night?

367
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,980
 Come in. 

368
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,770
Yes, Sir.

369
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,080
 It's located where the sun rises. 

370
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,710
 That means it's the palace that sees the sun first. 

371
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,880
 You live where the sun rises. 

372
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,570
 Is that not so cool? 

373
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:18,270
You make the best rice in the world.

374
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,330
Look, I did not even leave a single grain.

375
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,060
I am happy that you liked it.

376
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:33,190
My Lady, would we be able to return to Gaeseong?

377
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,300
I am sure that day will come.

378
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,820
A capture-and-return order is out for me.

379
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,660
Even the soldiers from the Ministry of Defense had come to the house.

380
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,510
It is okay, My Lady!I am really okay!

381
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,340
Thankfully, I avoided the crisis by being clever, too.

382
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,830
It is my fault!

383
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,540
My Lady.

384
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,830
If it was not for you, I would have died when I was very young!

385
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,100
I had the plague, and everyone said to discard me as dead.

386
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,130
But you are the one who saved me without giving up.

387
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,520
But still...

388
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,640
I am sorry.

389
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:25,400
I was a bit shocked and scared yesterday, but I am okay now.

390
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,480
Even if the character "Bi" is branded on my right cheek,
  (T/N: It means female servant) 

391
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,340
I...

392
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,000
will overcome bravely.

393
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,030
So, My Lady,

394
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,490
you should not get tired, either.

395
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,600
I am sure we can return to Gaeseong.

396
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,060
Yes.

397
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,300
You have no idea how much I depend on you.

398
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,880
Yes.

399
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,270
By the way, I'm sure your teacher will see the notice for your capture.

400
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,200
- Would that be okay? 
 - Gosh!

401
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,370
Myung Jin has no interest in my name.

402
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,490
He is cute and funny. He calls himself "Myung Jin."

403
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:21,360
Gosh, Myung Jin you woke up so early today, too.

404
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,950
The air is so nice today, Myung Jin.

405
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,960
Well...

406
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,470
Lady Min Jae Yi,

407
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,680
and her servant, Jang Ga Ram.

408
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,580
Did you both sleep well somewhere?

409
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,040
Please be well.

410
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,620
He only cares about his work.

411
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,180
He doesn't even know my name.

412
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,270
He calls me "You little" or "That little."

413
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,270
When he is in a good mood, he says, "My student."

414
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,240
To Teacher, that is my name.

415
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,700
He probably does not even know that I have a name.

416
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,830
We saw the notice together, yet he did not know.

417
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,780
What did you say at the Shamanist Bureau?

418
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,980
If you follow the order, we can go back to our hometown, right?

419
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,740
We have to.

420
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,520
Oh Wol must be waiting for us.

421
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,580
   

422
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,480
 I do not carry it around to attack anyone. 

423
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,810
 It is just a dagger I keep on me to protect myself. 

424
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,870
Is Eunuch So out there?

425
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,030
Yes, Your Highness.

426
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,850
- Bring Tae Kang here. 
 - Yes.

427
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,940
What is this? What does it say on it?

428
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,040
- It is Shim Young's will. 
 - Pardon?

429
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,720
Do you mean he is dead?

430
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,130
He apparently killed himself.

431
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,140
"I am sorry that I am leaving sooner without keeping our promise."

432
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,200
That is what he said in his will.

433
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,690
Did you promise something to him?

434
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,670
Were Young and I... lovers, by chance?

435
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,370
What are you talking about?

436
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,330
What did you think about this? Tell me the truth.

437
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,330
Did you feel that way, too?

438
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,280
That Young and I had affection

439
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,100
between a man and a woman?

440
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,330
Gosh, My Lady...

441
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:01,040
you are warm to anyone, regardless of their age, gender, or status.

442
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,340
There is something wrong with my memory.

443
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,540
In what way?

444
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,240
I cannot remember the things that happened around the time my family passed away.

445
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,460
Why did Young leave a message like that by taking his life?

446
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,450
There must have been a reason, do you not think?

447
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,960
How strange. There is no reason why he would put you in danger.

448
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,040
He confessed at the government office that you put poison in the soup for your family, too.

449
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,030
Is that not strange?

450
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,220
He would never do such a thing.

451
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,990
 Maybe I did not tell Ga Ram 

452
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:42,060
 that Young and I were in love with each other. 

453
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,870
 Maybe I am failing to remember it. 

454
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,070
 What if I fooled Ga Ram, too? 

455
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,850
By the way, why did you sleep here last night?

456
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,030
- I got kicked out of the Eastern Palace. 
 - Pardon?

457
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,070
How did that happen?

458
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,610
Something happened.

459
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,860
What would happen from now on, then?

460
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,470
There is no way to know.

461
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,030
I cannot live in the palace from now on.

462
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,860
Like the palace workers on shifts, I should go home to my private residence at night.

463
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,000
But I have nowhere to return to.

464
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,140
Would it be okay if I slept here from now on?

465
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,240
You do not have to worry about the Teacher.

466
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,250
But will you keep sleeping where dead bodies are laid?

467
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,050
Did you summon me, Your Highness?

468
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,080
I have been here since a while ago.

469
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,710
Is there something you want me to do, Your Highness?

470
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,650
Did Go Soon Dol...

471
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,930
sleep...

472
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,150
okay last night?

473
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,910
How would I know that?

474
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,400
- What? 
 - Pardon?

475
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,530
Your Highness ordered me to kick him out.

476
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,600
So I locked the door to the small palace.

477
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,220
- What do you mean, "lock?" 
 - Like I said,

478
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,800
I kicked him out of the library and s-secured the lock on the door.

479
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,330
And that little thing swore at me so much.

480
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,290
 Damn it, you bastard! You stupid bastard! 

481
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,770
 You are a Guardian Warrior, so what? 

482
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,360
 If you are a Guardian Warrior, can you mock someone who got kicked out? 

483
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,920
 I will teach you a thing or two one of these days! 

484
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,480
 I will never hold back! 

485
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,960
So...

486
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,100
where did that kid go... at night, exactly?

487
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,550
He probably went to his home.

488
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,480
 If you turn away from me, Your Highness, 

489
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,680
 I could be dead today. 

490
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,890
Here is the document you requested from Royal Investigation Bureau.

491
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh, right. That Go Soon Dol insisted that I tell Your Highness this.

492
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,320
- What did he say? 
 - Seriously...

493
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,690
Oh, right...

494
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,970
He said there is something you must see at the library.

495
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,090
 They say it was not the incense used at the Shamanist Bureau. 

496
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,140
   

497
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,950
I guess they are busy setting up the Royal Villa.

498
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,920
Go Soon Dol.

499
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,230
Why is he still working as a eunuch instead of going back to the army of fifth-degree?

500
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,500
I really cannot understand him.

501
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,960
Does he have nowhere to go?

502
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,010
You should question him, Your Highness.

503
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,690
 Did he see the incense and the petals? 

504
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,100
What are you doing there? Come here and get to work!

505
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:28,360
   

506
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,760
You should apply it very carefully.

507
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,160
An important person will be moving into this palace.

508
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,470
An important person?

509
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,460
Do you not know there is a selection for a crown princess soon?

510
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,880
The selected crown princess will be staying here until the royal marriage.

511
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,000
Traditionally, the Royal Villa should be placed somewhere between the palace and her home,

512
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,520
but His Highness chose this place personally.

513
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,290
So it should not be lacking in any way.

514
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,190
Royal marriage...

515
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,680
I wanted to see you because I wanted to ask you about what happened in Gaeseong in person.

516
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,600
According to Guardian Warrior, Shim Young was definitely Min Jae Yi's lover.

517
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,280
What makes you think that?

518
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,510
That is what he told people before he died,

519
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,100
and he apparently cried a lot looking at the jade bracelet he shared with Min Jae Yi.

520
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,630
Apparently, that jade bracelet was definitely exchanged as a symbol of love.

521
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,790
He roamed around that house as though he had lost his mind, and he looked through the whole house

522
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,150
in order to find a trace of Min Jae Yi.

523
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,080
That should be enough.

524
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,040
 Do you know how precious your trust is to me? 

525
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:31,550
   

526
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,700
What brings you here, Sergeant?

527
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,080
Can I see the record of Gaeseong's family murders?

528
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,140
The thing is...

529
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,280
If it is difficult to find, I will come back tomorrow.

530
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,670
It is not that.

531
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,910
The Eastern Palace took it.

532
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,850
The man who was supposed to be Min Jae Yi's lover committed suicide a few days ago.

533
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,480
So Gaeseong County Office sent the records regarding that.

534
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,840
The officials from the Crown Prince's Royal Bodyguard Unit took it.

535
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,560
 He even took the case record from Gaeseong county? 

536
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:35,080
 What is the reason why His Highness is 

537
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,510
 looking into this case so thoroughly? 

538
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,760
I heard Your Highness took the will of someone named

539
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,340
Shim Young, who committed suicide in Gaeseong.

540
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,000
Are you investigating my betrothed's case on your own?

541
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,790
Min Jae Yi is a criminal who committed the serious crime of murdering my master and his family.

542
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,730
Why is it so strange that I care about my master's death?

543
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,040
If so...

544
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:07,380
may I look at that will?

545
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,930
Are you waiting for that woman, by chance?

546
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:15,900
Even if she comes back alive, she will face death in an execution.

547
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,000
She is bound to die, even if she comes back.

548
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,930
   

549
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,320
I dedicated our marriage to the Youngsan Han family's ancestral shrine and sent over a letter of proposal.

550
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,670
And I received a letter of approval for our marriage from the Andong Min family.

551
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,260
Even if she is an immoral woman who fooled around with her lover,

552
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,160
unless I burn this letter of approval to marry,

553
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,610
Min Jae Yi is the woman whom I need to protect.

554
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,250
Do you trust that woman?

555
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:00,570
The man who is supposed to be her lover killed himself to prove her immoral betrayal.

556
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,010
Are you saying he gave up his one and only life just to frame Min Jae Yi?

557
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,550
Who knows if someone might have framed her by pretending to be her lover?

558
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:16,130
Are you investigating this case to protect that woman, by chance?

559
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,200
She is my master's daughter.

560
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,540
If she is innocent,

561
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,420
I will protect her.

562
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,600
Your Highness...

563
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,400
If that woman comes back alive and proves her innocence,

564
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,220
I will send her to you.

565
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,770
You promised me.

566
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,900
I am sure you will be able to save her, Your Highness.

567
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,320
She is a strong woman.

568
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,680
Even if it were not for me, she will return to you on her own.

569
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,100
Goodness, have another glass!

570
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,070
Goodness!

571
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,390
Goodness!

572
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:08,380
- Me, too. 
 - Yes, drink as much as you want!

573
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,250
- Thank you! 
 - Hurry, hurry, hurry!

574
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,000
- Cheers! 
 - Here we go!

575
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,110
It would have been nice if Scholar Park were here, too.

576
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,450
I am so happy that you got kicked out, Eunuch Go!

577
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,630
- We get to see you every day! 
 - I am even happier!

578
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,900
If I were still at the Eastern Palace,

579
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,900
I would be grinding ink in His Highness' inkstone right now!

580
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,890
It is due to my lack of experience!

581
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,390
It is fine.

582
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,030
- You may stop and leave– 
 - I will leave now, then!

583
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,770
Older Brother!

584
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,190
Long time no see.

585
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,290
I was just wondering how you were doing.

586
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,620
I heard the head shaman still has not revealed the last character.

587
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,510
When will the royal lecture be held?

588
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,320
I am sure it will be held soon.

589
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,350
I heard His Highness would be giving the lecture himself.

590
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,280
That is what I hear.

591
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,160
He apparently got kicked out of the Eastern Palace!

592
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,750
You know that Crown Prince?

593
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,060
It looks like he is as mean as they say.

594
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,460
Eunuch Go is a rare talent who solved the serial murder case.

595
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,600
How could he kick him out just like that?

596
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,920
He would not have done that without reason.

597
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,670
There must be a good reason for that.

598
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,160
What did Eunuch Go do, exactly?

599
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,190
I did not do anything.

600
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,210
I just got dragged out and got kicked out in the middle of the night.

601
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,530
You have met His Highness, Scholar Park.

602
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,470
You must know him well because His Highness sent you here.

603
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,830
Eunuch Go has nowhere to go.

604
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,850
This is all because he only eats nice food in the palace and is told,

605
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,450
"Your Highness, Your Highness!"

606
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,990
Everyone puts him up on a pedestal. No wonder he has no affection or empathy!

607
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:20,720
I think... you must understand the world first if you want to be the king.

608
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,030
What is your opinion on this?

609
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,800
I do not even know how to shovel. What do I know?

610
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,100
That, too!

611
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,400
Are you a scholar just because you wear the hat, the robe and walk around proudly?

612
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,910
Scholars need to understand the world, too!

613
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,250
You have to try shoveling, too. You know?You should try enjoying the nightlife a bit, too!

614
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,430
You must know how to have fun, too.

615
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,070
My goodness! Well, what brings you here, Scholar?

616
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,790
- By the way, why do you keep calling me "older brother" anyway? 
 - Well...

617
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,160
We both take orders from His Highness. You think, "Hey!"

618
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,050
- is better? 
 - Listen to you.

619
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,740
Let me just call you an older brother.

620
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,960
Anyone would say I, Myung Jin, look younger than you.

621
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,980
- Someone tell this man the truth— 
 - What brings you here anyway?

622
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,290
Did His Highness give you something to show to the Young Master?

623
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,800
This incense burner was found in the house of the shaman who got arrested as the culprit of the serial murders.

624
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,060
And the rest is what was inside of it.

625
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,780
- These petals are... 
 - They are peonies.

626
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,210
But peonies are scentless, are they not?

627
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,760
How could you use it as incense if it has no scent?

628
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,080
It is not true that peonies are scentless.

629
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,350
People just think the fable is true.

630
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,970
Using not just peonies, but any dried flowers

631
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:03,280
as incense with the petals intact like this is unheard of.

632
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,120
Do you mean they might not be just dried peonies?

633
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,320
Maybe she mixed something else in it.

634
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,910
She might have.

635
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,170
I cannot tell by just smelling like this.

636
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:24,880
No one here has smelled it properly before.

637
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,020
But you know who I am. Me?

638
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,800
Me? Me? Me?

639
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,470
The head of Manyeondang, Kim Myung Jin. Let me look into it!

640
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,780
- Are you ready, my student? 
 - Yes!

641
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,280
I will follow you anywhere, Teacher.

642
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,820
By the way, did you come here just to deliver this?

643
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,540
How about the Royal Bodyguard Unit official who runs errands for His Highness?

644
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,410
Is he busy?

645
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,830
Right!

646
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,840
Older Brother!

647
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,240
I did not know how friendly of a person you were!

648
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:05,020
Older Brother, you must have volunteered to run this errand because you missed us.

649
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,820
No!

650
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,880
That is not true at all! What are you talking about?

651
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,110
Just be honest! I think he did!

652
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,450
I think he did! I think he came because he missed us!

653
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,470
- Right? Right? Right? 
 - Yes.

654
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:19,790
We got you!

655
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,620
I said no!

656
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,640
Why would I miss you and even like you? I have not seen you that often.

657
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,110
I am not a weak person who mixes work with feelings.

658
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:30,780
His Highness told me to deliver this because it is important...

659
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,500
All right.

660
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,970
You did not come because you missed us.

661
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,160
You had no choice but to run an errand because of His Highness' order.

662
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,110
So you came even though you really did not want to come.

663
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,160
Should I understand it that way?

664
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,740
You are such a strange person! Just say you came because you missed us!

665
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,820
- Is that so hard to say? 
 - Right.

666
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,880
By chance, have you not said that before?

667
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,490
I can say it.

668
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,290
I have... missed you, Older Brother!

669
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,300
I really missed you!

670
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,810
What are you doing right now?

671
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,950
Gosh!

672
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,550
Goodness, I feel much better after saying it!

673
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,340
Well done!

674
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,930
I have something to tell you, Scholar Park.

675
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,990
The day I found the incense at the shaman's house,

676
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,240
I remembered that I saw dried peony leaves burning

677
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,920
in the kitchen when I was serving the soup for my family.

678
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,870
Were they really the same petals?

679
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:42,450
I also remember that Shim Young visited me in the kitchen.

680
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,430
Are you sure you remember that?

681
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,270
What did you two discuss?

682
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,580
I do not remember that.

683
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,720
However...

684
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,580
Young is not my lover.

685
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,850
No matter how much I think about it, he is not!

686
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:59,940
But I do not think Young would lie by killing himself, either.

687
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,890
There must have been...

688
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,110
a reason why Young did that.

689
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,280
And....

690
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:12,640
the memory of the dried peony leaves burning in that bowl

691
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,690
is definitely vivid.

692
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,370
 Is that the key evidence that the shaman case is related to Master's murder? 

693
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:26,060
I told you everything I needed to say.I will get going, then.

694
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,840
He could not have...

695
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,060
come here to say that he regrets kicking me out, right?

696
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,750
I am sure it is even less likely that he came to apologize.

697
00:57:55,910 --> 00:58:01,000
Yes. He would never do such a thing!

698
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,320
Go ahead to the Royal Bodyguard Unit.

699
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,380
I have a place to stop by.

700
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,420
Yes, Your Highness.

701
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,600
Geez!

702
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,300
You bastard!

703
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,550
He knows that I have no place to go. What a heartless bastard.

704
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:29,560
Yes, you must be happy that this huge palace is your home!

705
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,720
So what if you have a big house?

706
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:37,560
Your heart is even smaller than a small soy sauce plate.I really cannot believe this!

707
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,300
He even said I shot the arrow at him on the hunting grounds and messed up the celebratory message?

708
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:46,670
Even if the entire world calls me the murderer of Gaeseong, you cannot do this to me!

709
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,710
You should have trusted me.

710
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,610
You said you would!

711
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,000
You stupid idiot. You selfish bastard!

712
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,310
You look like a bird's nest in a full moon.

713
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,260
Geez!

714
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:12,960
Screw you!

715
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,520
♫  It was just for a moment  ♫

716
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,090
♫  On the day we smiled at each other  ♫

717
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:35,860
♫  It fell like a dry leaf  ♫

718
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:45,650
♫  You understand my heart as if it is sick  ♫

719
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:53,380
♫  Because of that moment, I still love  ♫

720
01:00:53,380 --> 01:01:00,890
♫  Will you come back to me even after we grow apart?  ♫

721
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:09,050
♫  Just like the wind that carried me away  ♫

722
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:11,190
   

723
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,210
 Are you that upset with me? 

724
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,880
 I am no longer the eunuch of the Eastern Palace. 

725
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,710
 Soon Dol, go to the library and... 

726
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,300
♫  Wherever it is  ♫

727
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,470
 I will rewrite history! 

728
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,860
 His Majesty, the King is here! 

729
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,170
 I have returned. 

730
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,440
 Do you acknowledge your sin? 

731
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,780
 I will uproot all of you completely 

732
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,470
 and tear you into tiny little pieces! 

733
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,800
 You should know that I will never lose.
