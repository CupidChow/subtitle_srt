1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,982
Are you feeling stiff?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,373
I know how to massage.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,586
I’d love to have a partner who’s good at massaging though.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,964
Pie, can you stand still for 10 seconds?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,622
What’s wrong with you?

6
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,066
That didn’t feel the same as when I was with Judy.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,297
Don’t tell me

8
00:00:21,573 --> 00:00:23,102
you like Judy.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,982
Can you stop talking about the mentors?

10
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:27,413
What’s wrong with him?

11
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,066
Now that you’re full, tell me

12
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:30,648
why you’re so mad at me today.

13
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,640
You didn’t care about my feelings.

14
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:34,328
Why did you give them to someone else?

15
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:36,195
If you didn’t want to eat them, you could’ve just given them back to me.

16
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,715
You can have them back if you want.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,475
I’ve only had a few pieces.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,462
Is this what you meant when you said he’s in love?

19
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,928
When you love or like someone, it definitely shows through your actions, Ryan.

20
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,346
Who do you like again, Ryan?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,195
(I never thought that when you start missing someone,)

22
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,991
(it would make every day feel this much more special.)

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,475
(Everything seems light and comfortable like I’m somehow floating on air.)

24
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,470
(Today is probably going to be a good day.)

25
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,235
(Are you almost there? Come listen to me vent. I’m stressed.)

26
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,502
(This must be about Judy again.)

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,004
Hey, have you taken your vitamins at all?

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,084
I can hear you sniff again.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,568
Here.

30
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:40,800
You must take them.

31
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,622
You use your body a lot.

32
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:43,964
You must take care of it.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,213
Take this.

34
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,462
(Do you still feel the same about Tae?)

35
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,782
(The same? What’s still the same is how he doesn’t care about me.)

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,800
(It’s our anniversary this Saturday. I don’t even know if he remembers.)

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,364
EP 7: TECHNICAL ERROR

38
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:38,800
Grandpa Noi’s Kitchen only.

39
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,346
Is that okay?

40
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:47,946
If not, I can record it again.

41
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,760
It’s okay. Thanks a lot.

42
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:52,373
Feel free to ask me to do anything.

43
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,951
I can buy food, buy snacks, carry stuff — I’m always ready to help.

44
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,440
Alright. Thanks a lot.

45
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:58,542
Now get back to work.

46
00:04:58,586 --> 00:04:59,075
Okay.

47
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,315
Hey, how are you?

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,982
Hey, is it done?

49
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,626
Yes.

50
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,404
But I haven’t rendered it yet.

51
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:11,400
Do you want to check it first?

52
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,724
I’ll ask Ton to take a look.

53
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,248
Hey, I didn’t delete the files.

54
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,280
It was him.

55
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,964
He’s talking in his sleep.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,897
I’ll go and get some sleep too.

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,875
I’ve been up since yesterday without taking a nap.

58
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,084
Whoa.

59
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:28,755
Is there a lot more to finish?

60
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,271
It’s urgent work.

61
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:33,342
Do you want to help me?

62
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,497
If you do, come stay at the office this weekend.

63
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,982
You can take Monday to Wednesday off instead.

64
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,964
Thursday too.

65
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,222
What do you say?

66
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,110
Can I help get it done by Friday?

67
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:53,137
I have plans on Saturday.

68
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,466
That’s too tight.

69
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,693
It’s impossible.

70
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,690
The work is due on Monday.

71
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,417
We can finish over the weekend.

72
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,137
It’s my anniversary with Ba-Mhee this Saturday.

73
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,484
Up to you then.

74
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:08,808
If you think you can finish it.

75
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:11,991
Oh, Ba-Mhee.

76
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,991
Of all the people to date, you’re dating a post-production guy.

77
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:33,940
(Reservation Confirmation)

78
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,444
5 DAYS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,968
If you’re worried about him forgetting,

80
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,680
just tell him it’s your anniversary this Saturday.

81
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,688
I’ve been reminding him every year.

82
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:16,248
Are you really supposed to remind each other about these things?

83
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
I’m not the only one in this relationship.

84
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,924
Then tell him directly

85
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,551
that you’re not okay with him forgetting the anniversary.

86
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,817
But honestly, I can’t even remember my mom’s birthday.

87
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:31,031
No one can remember every day in their lives.

88
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,817
Judy can.

89
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,462
She didn’t even have to put it on the calendar to remember all the meetings.

90
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,466
You know what? You talk about her a lot.

91
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:54,140
Do you really have a crush on Judy?

92
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,751
Okay.

93
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:33,351
We’ll go with that.

94
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:36,871
Please put everything in the slides so I can present it all at once.

95
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:07,760
And this is the beauty and value of living life with Joy Life Collagen Tripeptide.

96
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,742
I haven’t heard your voice today, Mr. Jane.

97
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,826
I came specifically to hear you speak.

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,973
I came specifically to hear you speak.

99
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,742
Excuse me, Ms. Joy.

100
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,333
Could you please focus on work?

101
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,475
Everyone in this room doesn’t have time to listen to your flirting with the Assistant Director.

102
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,888
He

103
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,244
is mine.

104
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:05,386
Ryan.

105
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,382
Ryan.

106
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:09,688
What’s wrong?

107
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,817
Inside this bag is a mockup.

108
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,564
And this is the real one.

109
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,906
Inside this bag is a mockup.

110
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:29,848
And this is the real one.

111
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,271
Just when I’m hungry.

112
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,431
Please take it from here.

113
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:07,280
Why are you mad at Ms. Joy?

114
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,253
What did she do to you, Ryan?

115
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:10,951
Ugh.

116
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,662
It’s so dusty here.

117
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,253
4 DAYS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

118
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,250
Tae, I made you a sandwich.

119
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,044
Shall we eat it together?

120
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:35,600
Shall we eat it together?

121
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,488
(Keep going, Tae.)

122
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,515
I think we should remove this word and just use this word alone.

123
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:11,617
Okay.

124
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:12,417
It makes more sense and is clearer.

125
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:12,977
Yeah.

126
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,928
I really like the reference Ball showed us. Do you like it?

127
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:18,728
I do.

128
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,791
I like the reference Uncle Moo sent over.

129
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:31,448
Huh?

130
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,368
Uncle Moo asked us to look at his reference too?

131
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,164
I thought it was just Ball.

132
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:44,497
3 DAYS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

133
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,493
(Have you had lunch? Can I order you anything?)

134
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,342
(Have you eaten the sandwich, Tae?)

135
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:54,960
(I’ll eat it soon.)

136
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,782
Come on, let’s go eat.

137
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,364
You’re hungry, aren’t you?

138
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,840
Come on. Get your things.

139
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,555
I’m starving. Hurry up.

140
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:26,195
Let’s go.

141
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:45,973
What are you daydreaming about?

142
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,320
2 DAYS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

143
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,715
Tae.

144
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,124
Tae.

145
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,182
Tae, this Saturday, I…

146
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:25,973
I’ll eat it later.

147
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:26,826
Just leave it there.

148
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,417
Let me work first.

149
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,088
(Keep going, Tae.)

150
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,186
Hey.

151
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,306
Why did you throw it away?

152
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:59,315
It’s gone bad now. No one ate it.

153
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,964
Come and sit here.

154
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,697
Can you eat these?

155
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,995
Which one would you like?

156
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,684
I’d like this one.

157
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,564
Okay.

158
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,257
Don’t just take care of someone else.

159
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,250
Take care of yourself too.

160
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,871
Here.

161
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,942
Eat up.

162
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,151
I’m going to eat too. I’m so hungry.

163
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:53,537
I don’t need the spoon and fork.

164
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:54,800
You’re going to use your hands?

165
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,791
Yummy.

166
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,222
Thank you.

167
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,817
What are you thinking, Ryan?

168
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Why do you keep looking at him secretly?

169
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:31,608
Why are you mad when he seems close with someone else?

170
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,342
It’s just work, isn’t it?

171
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,760
Just work? Who even buys that?

172
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,760
He knows what that woman is thinking.

173
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,342
But even if she’s into him, what does it have to do with you, Ryan?

174
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:46,284
Ugh! Stop talking to yourself already!

175
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,591
Yes.

176
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,973
Stop talking to yourself already.

177
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,608
And stop pressing the copy button.

178
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,813
I'm sorry.

179
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,902
Your stomach isn’t growling.

180
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:43,048
Why do you care if my stomach growls?

181
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,040
When your stomach growls, you always act weird.

182
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,368
Me? Weird?

183
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:52,524
You’re the weird one for listening to other people’s stomachs growling.

184
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,840
You’re the weird one.

185
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,568
You’ve been acting weird for a few days.

186
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:58,177
Do you realize that?

187
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,520
Nothing is wrong with me.

188
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,191
You don’t need to pay attention to me.

189
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,671
How can I not?

190
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,670
You’re my intern.

191
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,226
Stop holding it back and tell me what’s wrong.

192
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,377
Ms. Joy seems to like you.

193
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,111
What about that?

194
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,497
Are you crazy?

195
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,173
You’re smiling at the photocopier.

196
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,146
(We wish your business success.)

197
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,497
Hey, Ju.

198
00:19:12,524 --> 00:19:14,440
Foy, Hi.

199
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,626
Hi.

200
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,777
Sorry for showing up unannounced.

201
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:19,626
I was in the neighborhood.

202
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,200
No worries. It’s all good.

203
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,617
I was just going to visit you the other day.

204
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,955
This is Ba-Mhee.

205
00:19:26,115 --> 00:19:27,155
Oh, hi.

206
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,697
I brought you a gift for your office’s 10-year anniversary.

207
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,080
Are the others here?

208
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:40,675
Mr. Jack, Ms. Ty, and Mint, that intern.

209
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,417
She was back with us for almost a year but left to continue her studies now.

210
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:48,328
You really care and pay good attention.

211
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,817
How can the clients not love you?

212
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:53,893
By the way, our team has a new project.

213
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:56,275
Are you in a hurry? Join us for dinner.

214
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,137
We’ve booked a room with karaoke.

215
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,284
Please come. It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other.

216
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:05,410
My boss is coming too, a big client.

217
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,777
Come.

218
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,173
Join us for dinner.

219
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:10,515
Do you like singing karaoke?

220
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,128
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

221
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,871
If you’re still hesitant (erng oey)

222
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,493
The more you act like a keyboard warrior

223
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,048
If you’re still hesitant (erng oey)

224
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,502
Are you really this calm or were you electrocuted?

225
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,173
If you’re still being this tricky

226
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,124
I have to say bye bye bye bye bye

227
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,315
Next is a duet song.

228
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:34,924
I need one volunteer.

229
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,062
Mister.

230
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,195
Come up.

231
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,991
Please sing with me.

232
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,635
Come on!

233
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,591
If your heart is available

234
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,488
Let me, let me, please, enter

235
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,004
So I can take a look inside

236
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,999
Is there a room for me to find?

237
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,777
If you dare to take a leap, come on in

238
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,568
Do more than gazing from a distance

239
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:12,657
Let me know if your heart is occupied

240
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:15,466
Knock, knock, who is there?

241
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,275
Thank you.

242
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:23,004
Thank you.

243
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,337
Bravo!

244
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,488
I’m not even 30, but that little bit of dancing has already tired me out.

245
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,031
You don’t have to be 30. I’m 21 and I’m out of breath.

246
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,973
You were dancing like it was your own concert.

247
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,057
Well, you go first.

248
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,395
Both glasses are the same.

249
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,457
(I have to stay another night at the office.)

250
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:01,955
(It’s the last night before we submit the work tomorrow.)

251
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,791
Come on.

252
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,253
Let’s go back inside.

253
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:22,968
For the next song, I’d like to request one by 2002 Ratree.

254
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,333
I wasn’t born yet.

255
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,666
Come on.

256
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,800
Are you calling me old?

257
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,088
No.

258
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,977
Aren’t you leaving, Jane?

259
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,395
I need to finish up some work.

260
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:54,568
Go ahead without me.

261
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,964
Good evening.

262
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,168
Good evening.

263
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,435
What are you looking for, Jo?

264
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:07,457
Can I help?

265
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:08,471
No, it’s fine.

266
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,982
I’m just looking for a document.

267
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,555
Hey, Jane. Where did Prang keep the document for the bills?

268
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,906
I don’t know either.

269
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,431
1 DAY BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

270
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,786
(Out for pre-production pitch with Baimon.)

271
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:09,973
(Back in the afternoon. Call me if you need anything.)

272
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:15,911
Hey, Uncle Moo asked me to get the collagen capsule bottle for the test.

273
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,711
Oh, for the moisturized skin scene, right?

274
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:19,271
Yes.

275
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:20,400
Give me a second. Let me call and ask Jane.

276
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,564
Yeah, go ahead.

277
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,004
Please help me.

278
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,591
Have you found it?

279
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:44,088
We paid an expensive fee to hire the technical team.

280
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,590
If we have to pay OT, Prang will scold us.

281
00:25:57,928 --> 00:25:59,440
It should be this one.

282
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,497
There’s only one.

283
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,008
Are you sure?

284
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,013
Okay. I’m going then.

285
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:05,786
Thank you.

286
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,155
Come on, not again.

287
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:26,702
(For Test)

288
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,511
7 HOURS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

289
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,364
It’s done!

290
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,195
Whoa.

291
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,542
How did you do it?

292
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:47,340
Superhuman.

293
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:50,746
You finished a week's work within 3 days.

294
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:51,697
Amazing.

295
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:57,857
Should I find someone to date to get motivated like you?

296
00:26:58,266 --> 00:26:59,422
Do you want to date me?

297
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,244
You killed my vibe.

298
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,617
I’m off, guys.

299
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:06,862
See you on Monday.

300
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:14,860
See you.

301
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,000
(I’m meeting with the clients here. Will be back as soon as I finish.)

302
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,791
Ms. Joy, I’m sorry this meeting has to be online today.

303
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:39,840
Please allow me to keep my camera off as I’m outside.

304
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:43,075
Today, we’re having the mechanic test for the moisturized skin scene.

305
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:45,982
We should be able to send the shot to you this evening.

306
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,102
Now, Jane wants you to help recheck if the product looks okay.

307
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,133
Where’s Pie and Baimon?

308
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:58,213
They’ll be here soon.

309
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,471
Can you try stirring it for me?

310
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:06,720
Okay.

311
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,097
Can you turn the other way?

312
00:28:22,622 --> 00:28:24,417
This angle looks great, Mr. Jane.

313
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,515
Do you like it like this?

314
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,040
I’ve liked it from the beginning.

315
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,420
This is an abuse of a professional position.

316
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,991
Everyone can see what she’s up to.

317
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,413
Jane, don’t let your fingers block the product.

318
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,991
Did I really have to remind you of that?

319
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:46,568
Can you start over and show me again?

320
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:48,355
Give me a second to take notes.

321
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,266
Ryan.

322
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,600
Ryan.

323
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,191
Ryan.

324
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:06,195
Ryan.

325
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,333
Yes, Jane?

326
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,871
Were you talking to your guardian angel?

327
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,195
Grab the Post-Its for me.

328
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:20,915
Actually, Ms. Joy taught me how to stir it, but I haven’t had time to teach you, Jane.

329
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,515
Looks like I’ll need to train you myself

330
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,533
so you don’t get shy, Jane.

331
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,982
If you want to flirt with each other, do it somewhere else, not in the office.

332
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,284
You’re talented, Jane.

333
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,955
You can do it.

334
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,324
Right?

335
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,471
Why is he mad?

336
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:18,195
Oh, shit.

337
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:19,946
Where did you get this bottle?

338
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,888
The director’s room.

339
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,680
Did you not check first?

340
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:33,680
It’s not what we need for the test.

341
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,151
I’m sorry.

342
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:38,337
I didn’t know which bottle to take.

343
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,511
It’s dangerous.

344
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:43,751
Check carefully before you grab anything next time.

345
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:47,200
If the office caught fire, I wouldn’t be able to take responsibility.

346
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,537
Who took the bottle from behind my desk to do the test?

347
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,946
Go wait for me in my office.

348
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,528
Let me check carefully again.

349
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,471
Do you think we can fix this in time?

350
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,648
Are you okay?

351
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,946
I shouldn’t have made that decision on my own.

352
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:53,395
3 HOURS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

353
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,262
Judy, do you have a power bank?

354
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:14,830
Guys, please enjoy.

355
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,964
Okay.

356
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:29,706
See? By singing with us for just one night, you won my boss’ heart.

357
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:32,373
Today, he’s giving you a new project already.

358
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,982
I’m grateful your boss is giving us another opportunity.

359
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:44,951
Actually, my boss chooses who to work with based on physiognomy.

360
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:48,284
If the profiles are similar,

361
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:51,955
he’ll choose the one with the better first impression.

362
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,213
That girl’s dance was probably why.

363
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:02,408
I’m not dancing today.

364
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:05,093
My neck and back hurt.

365
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,155
Come on. Don’t believe her.

366
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,951
Go all out.

367
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:12,622
Give it all you got.

368
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,435
I’ll carry you home.

369
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:15,626
Oh.

370
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:24,728
Hello, Jo.

371
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,031
Of course.

372
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:28,568
Please give me a moment.

373
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,395
Come on. It’s time to party.

374
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,186
Shit!

375
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,180
Who is it?

376
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,235
Oh, it’s you, Tae.

377
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:00,728
Why are you lying here face down?

378
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,528
Did I fall asleep?

379
00:34:03,573 --> 00:34:04,453
You sure did.

380
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,204
I thought someone died.

381
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,600
Anyway, what are you still doing here?

382
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,137
Waiting for Ba-Mhee?

383
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,991
Yeah.

384
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,222
She’s out to see the clients.

385
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:23,262
She’ll be back soon.

386
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:26,808
Why don’t you go see her there?

387
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:28,800
Your work is done, isn’t it?

388
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,928
I better not.

389
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:33,920
I should let her work.

390
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,920
What could she still be working on?

391
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:37,537
The clients are probably done for the day.

392
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,222
Do you want to go?

393
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,257
I can give you a ride on my motorbike.

394
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,871
Yes.

395
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:49,546
Okay.

396
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,182
Just don’t fall asleep while riding.

397
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,488
I won’t.

398
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:55,973
If you fall off, I won’t be able to help you.

399
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,430
You said you won’t fall asleep, but look at you.

400
00:35:00,462 --> 00:35:02,430
2 HOURS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

401
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:03,973
Wait for me.

402
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:04,844
Let’s go.

403
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,080
Okay.

404
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,955
I’ll send it to you as soon as possible tomorrow.

405
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,853
Okay.

406
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,871
Alright.

407
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:25,955
Hey.

408
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,275
Are you drunk already?

409
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:33,253
Well, your clients tried to get me drunk again.

410
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,893
I don’t know why they kept asking me to sing.

411
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,955
I know why. It’s fun when you sing.

412
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:41,360
I like it too.

413
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,497
Wow, you like it?

414
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,991
Anyway, have you found a power bank?

415
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,680
Oh, just forget it.

416
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,333
Even if my phone is charged, if he doesn’t want to talk to me,

417
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,471
it’s useless.

418
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,386
Are you really single?

419
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,257
Yes, why?

420
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,448
You’re pretty,

421
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,466
talented,

422
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,413
and nice.

423
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,880
Any man who walks by looks at you.

424
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,746
The thing is

425
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,231
I don’t like men.

426
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,684
For me, gender doesn’t really matter.

427
00:36:56,844 --> 00:37:01,902
I think I just haven’t found someone right for me.

428
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,204
Someone right? What does it mean?

429
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,373
Someone who asks you questions and you answer them.

430
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,191
Someone you wait for and they come to see you.

431
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,582
Someone who doesn’t make you feel lacking.

432
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:29,822
I don’t know how to explain.

433
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,777
If I ask but he doesn’t answer,

434
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,235
if I wait but he doesn’t come.

435
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,502
does that mean we’re not right for each other?

436
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,671
I’ve always thought that even without me,

437
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,848
he could be happy.

438
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,453
Somehow I feel like I’m in the way of his life.

439
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,070
Don’t say that you’re in the way.

440
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,528
The person who receives good love from you

441
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,230
is so lucky.

442
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,150
Do you really think so?

443
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,991
5 SECONDS BEFORE THE ANNIVERSARY

444
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:44,311
4…3…2…1

445
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:52,906
THE ANNIVERSARY

446
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:10,008
We need to pay OT for the art and technical teams to redo the test this weekend.

447
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,493
Baimon and Judy will need to come and supervise instead of the client.

448
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,640
I can help the art team.

449
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:19,395
Please don’t.

450
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,191
Just don’t do anything.

451
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,617
Why didn’t you check carefully?

452
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,355
If something had happened to anyone, would you have been able to take responsibility?

453
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,160
I’m sorry.

454
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,537
I didn’t mean it.

455
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,657
How is your apology helping?

456
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,817
If you had listened carefully to the client that day,

457
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:53,111
you’d have known this bottle was for the test.

458
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,066
Inside this bag is a mockup.

459
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,737
And this is the real one.

460
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,551
If you didn’t pay attention, you could’ve just asked someone else.

461
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:06,115
If you don’t know something, just say so.

462
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,266
I called you, but you didn’t pick up.

463
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:13,982
The art team needed the answer urgently.

464
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,035
In that situation, I didn’t have time to think like I do now.

465
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:16,660
Hey.

466
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,680
You can’t blame it on the situation.

467
00:42:22,302 --> 00:42:24,300
This was life and death.

468
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,471
Then why didn’t you pick up your phone?

469
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,470
Was I the only one you could call?

470
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,408
Was I the only one who knew about this?

471
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,488
Why couldn’t you figure out something so easy?

472
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,662
Next time, if you’re not taking your job seriously, just stay home.

473
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,755
Don’t come and make us feel bad every day.

474
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,986
Just go wherever you want.

475
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,644
I’m angry because I’m worried about you

476
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,422
and I’m sorry for being harsh just now.

477
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,395
I just wanted you to understand the consequences.

478
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,004
If someone had gotten hurt, you’d be responsible.

479
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,391
Next time, check carefully,

480
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:41,751
even if someone rushes you,

481
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,755
I’m not leaving.

482
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,973
I’m not going anywhere.

483
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:50,364
I like this job.

484
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,862
I like it here.

485
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,955
And I like you.

486
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:41,991
(Ryan After Work)

487
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:42,924
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

488
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:45,128
(Guys, I have a question.)

489
00:44:45,173 --> 00:44:46,533
(Ask away.)

490
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,515
(I heard someone on set mention a ‘mec shot’ or something like that.)

491
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:54,471
(I don’t know what it means.)

492
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:56,470
(How is it different from what we normally film?)

493
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:58,222
(Do you mean ‘mechanic’?)

494
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:04,364
(A mechanic shot is essentially a shot filmed using special equipment.)

495
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,431
(It’s mostly used for music videos and commercials.)

496
00:45:09,466 --> 00:45:11,084
(It’s similar to what we did for the pilot.)

497
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:13,555
(The cue and timings must be exactly right.)

498
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,702
(Remember how many takes it took us to film that frying vegetables shot?)

499
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,653
(Right. So many takes.)

500
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,559
(Why didn’t you ask Jane about this? He would know.)

501
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,773
(Awkward smile)

502
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,311
(Wait, or should you ask Baimon?)

503
00:45:28,337 --> 00:45:29,973
(Pie.)

504
00:45:30,017 --> 00:45:32,284
(Seriously. Baimon and I…?)

505
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,342
(Eye roll)

506
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:38,702
Tae, will you stop being miserable already?

507
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,417
I know you’re hurting badly.

508
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,044
Did you two not talk at all over the weekend?

509
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,484
What do you want me to talk about?

510
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,933
You saw what I saw, didn’t you?

511
00:45:44,968 --> 00:45:46,604
What’s up, lover girl?

512
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,484
How can I look at her the same way?

513
00:45:49,528 --> 00:45:51,004
I feel so bad for Tae.

514
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,826
Why didn’t you pay attention to work at all today?

515
00:45:52,871 --> 00:45:53,644
Me?

516
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:54,986
I should be asking what’s wrong with you.

517
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:56,808
It felt like you were bullying me all day.

518
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,168
Ryan, come here.

519
00:45:58,195 --> 00:45:58,711
Ryan.

520
00:45:58,746 --> 00:45:59,484
Get the actors.

521
00:45:59,520 --> 00:45:59,991
Ryan!

522
00:46:00,026 --> 00:46:00,435
Ryan!

523
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:00,915
Ryan!

524
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:01,431
Ryan!

525
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,395
Do you think that just because I confessed my feelings for you,

526
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,191
you can be mean to me however you want?
