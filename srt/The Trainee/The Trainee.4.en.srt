1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,320
Damn!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,320
What time did I tell you that we’d leave?

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,980
I was there after you left for 10 minutes.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,220
No matter how minutes it was, you were late.

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,370
	Even “10 minutes” is late.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,840
You guys please wait here.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,920
Don’t walk around.

8
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,540
Girl, my part is done. I can leave now, right?

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,030
You’re the aunty extra, right?

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,490
Yes.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,710
	So?

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,860
Your part is done. You can go home now.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,200
After finishing this shot, we’ll reshoot the morning’s shot.

14
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,500
There will be an office guy and aunty extra.

15
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,340
I saw she left for quite a while.

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,580
Did you let her go home?

17
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,820
I didn’t.

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
Then, who let the extra go home?

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,620
Will you be in trouble because of what happened today?

20
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,030
Nah. Just be scolded.

21
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,400
I thought the grown-ups wouldn’t be scolded.

22
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,110
Age doesn’t matter.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,810
One day, if I make a mistake with you,

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,410
I have to apologize to you, too.

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,840
Will you and Pie go to apologize to Jane?

26
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,680
I feel guilty for you.

27
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,730
(Nong Ink’s Printing)

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:10,930
Ouch!

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,720
Ouch!

30
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,200
Ouch!

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,090
What’s wrong?

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,720
Shoulder pain?

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,080
My whole body aches.

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,080
Being on set was like being at war.

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,330
Come here.

36
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,380
Let me see.

37
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,780
Come.

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,340
Does it hurt here?

39
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah.

40
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,260
Let me see.

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,260
Take this off.

42
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,270
Let me see.

43
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,880
You need this.

44
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,930
Come on, Dad.

45
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,430
I told you to stop using this yellow oil.

46
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,880
Does it help with your pain or not?

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
Just take it with you.

48
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,850
No, I can’t apply this at the office.

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
It smells bad. The seniors in my team would scold me.

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,060
What pain relief oil smells good?

51
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,780
Alright. Go to work.

52
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,480
Go.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,640
Just take it.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,860
He’s so fussy.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,430
EP 4: BACKUP FILES

56
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,830
I’ve worked with many housing agencies

57
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,090
 but never faced such silly issues.

58
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,720
  I have no excuses.

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,530
      We miscommunicated and it’s my responsibility.

60
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,290
  I’m truly sorry.

61
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,870
 Sorry, guys!

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,190
  I’m sorry!

63
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,320
  I’m sorry!

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,900
Have you found the footage Baimon asked for?

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,190
You can choose him

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,550
but if you ever feel disappointed or sad one day,

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,600
when you look back, I’ll be here for you.

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,540
Extra Koffee, warm and smooth just like your favorite cup of coffee.

69
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,000
Then, who let the extra go home?

70
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,660
Did anyone from the editing team bring me a hard disk?

71
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,200
Guys.

72
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,680
Hi, Jane.

73
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,990
I need to prepare the invoices for accounting.

74
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,910
How do I fill in this field?

75
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,100
That’s for the 3% tax deduction.

76
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,720
Just write the full rate for now.

77
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,900
Don’t forget to attach the invoices.

78
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,470
Okay.

79
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
If someone brings it to me,

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,090
What about the total field?

81
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,340
Do I calculate it myself or let accounting do it?

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,400
Sum it up yourself.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,790
Sum it up myself.

84
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,720
Okay.

85
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,740
If the editing team brings it to me,

86
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,680
Wait, what about this here?

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,600
Sit down.

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
Ask all your questions once and for all,

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
so you don’t have to keep coming back.

90
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,080
Actually, that was all my questions.

91
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,870
Thank you.

92
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,660
Goodbye.

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,040
It's the hard disk with No. 2 in the top right corner.

94
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,740
Please keep an eye out for it.

95
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
It has the footage I need.

96
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,240
550 baht.

97
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,520
Subtract 5%. Wait, or is it 3%?

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,780
Is it 3 or 5?

99
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,870
Damn.

100
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,650
Hey, watch out.

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,200
What’s that?

102
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,250
You’re dealing with the invoices, right?

103
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,100
Do you want to hand them in now?

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,620
They’re not all ready yet.

105
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,730
Once they are, I’ll bring them to your room.

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,790
I don’t accept anything from noon to 1 p.m.

107
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,000
If you’re coming after 3 p.m., come tomorrow instead, okay?

108
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,160
Okay.

109
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,920
Where was I?

110
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,620
Item 4, 3500, plus item 2, 750.

111
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,290
Babe,

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
have you taken your vitamin tablets?

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,700
Not yet, right?

114
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,880
Why won’t you listen to me?

115
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,560
You’re going to cough in your sleep again tonight.

116
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:36,790
Babe, vitamin tablets should be taken with water.

117
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,080
Go drink some water now.

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,700
Just a moment.

119
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,080
I need to bring a hard disk to the director team.

120
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,990
	As if sipping water is going to break your hard disk.

121
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,320
Come with me.

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,900
Okay.

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,680
I spit it out.

124
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,900
Why did you?

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,100
Let’s take it again right now.

126
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,410
Come on, Ba-Mhee.

127
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,280
Let’s take it again.

128
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,410
- Hurry up! Come with me! - 	Ba-Mhee.

129
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Come sip some water.

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,240
He’s going to drop it.

131
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,090
Ba-Mhee, I can take it at lunchtime.

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,880
It’s just a vitamin.

133
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,130
Come take it again right now.

134
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,880
Come on.

135
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
If you don’t take it now, don’t take it at all.

136
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,090
Pah!

137
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,210
I missed it.

138
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,600
This is the hard disk Jane is looking for.

139
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,550
It's the hard disk with No. 2 in the top right corner.

140
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,190
This is all because of your vitamin tablets.

141
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
Why didn’t you catch it?

142
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,620
How is this my fault?

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,720
I think I should confess it to him.

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,530
No, you can’t.

145
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,530
You could be disqualified from your internship.

146
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,540
Your dream of editing advertising videos will be ruined.

147
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,000
The No.2 hard disk will haunt you for the rest of your life.

148
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,830
What are you babbling about?

149
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,000
You read too many novels.

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Didn't this happen because you were pulling and almost tearing Tae's arm?

151
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,040
What are you going to do?

152
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm going to tell them that Tae was picking me up from home this morning

153
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,760
when suddenly a car came.

154
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,670
Come on. Let’s go over there.

155
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,410
It was about to crash into me hard.

156
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,690
Damn!

157
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,010
Ba-Mhee!

158
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,180
Ba-Mhee!

159
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,970
Tae!

160
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,620
I didn’t know what to do,

161
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,520
so he rushed in to save my life without thinking about his own.

162
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,150
That’s how the hard disk got broken.

163
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,160
What do you think, babe?

164
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,570
Yeah, good

165
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,560
You’re a genius.

166
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,170
That makes no sense at all.

167
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,170
Saying that would still mean it’s Tae’s fault.

168
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,870
If we really want to protect him, we need a detailed plan.

169
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,790
First, we need to delete the CCTV footage.

170
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,130
The first step is to put a sleeping pill in a glass of water.

171
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,600
Then use a decoy to distract the security guard.

172
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,750
Mr. Security, would you like a cold drink?

173
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,290
  The next step is to find a way to get into that room and eliminate all the evidence against us.

174
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,060
What should we do?

175
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,240
Easy.

176
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,350
Second step.

177
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,060
Should we try scanning his iris?

178
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,460
Yes.

179
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,700
We made it.

180
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,550
Pie, let me be honest.

181
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,880
I think you watch too many movies.

182
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,710
Do you think you’re in Mission Impossible?

183
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,870
And why would you make me play such a stupid role?

184
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,040
That’s not even 20% of the plan.

185
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,570
Let’s stop there.

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,350
If I let you continue to 100%, you’d definitely start using bombs like Michael Bay.

187
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,000
I think the best solution might be the closest one.

188
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,110
Tae, take a motorbike taxi to Fortune Town and get the hard disk fixed.

189
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,630
Okay.

190
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,960
But I don’t know how to do editing.

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,900
What?

192
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,900
The three of you will need to give me information all the time.

193
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,210
We’ll communicate via these earphones.

194
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,840
Here you go.

195
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,070
Here.

196
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,360
Here.

197
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,660
You guys will need to help me solve every problem so we don’t get caught.

198
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,920
Why? You don’t trust me?

199
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,110
Do you want to tell them you almost got run over by a car while crossing the road

200
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,420
or go with the Mission Impossible plan?

201
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,530
Pah, I don’t think we should do this.

202
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,090
Being honest with them is easier.

203
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,570
That’s such a loser move.

204
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,800
Test, test. Can you hear me?

205
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,330
Yes.

206
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,190
We can hear you.

207
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,690
Where did Pah go?

208
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,320
Where is he?

209
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,942
Where could he be?

210
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,057
I saw him walking around here.

211
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:13,462
Are all the invoices with him?

212
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:14,493
Yes, Moo.

213
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,200
Accounting keeps asking for them.

214
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,040
Damn it. Where is he?

215
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:23,711
Accounting wouldn’t stop asking.

216
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,466
Is he here?

217
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,911
Hey, Pah.

218
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,780
Did you switch up your style today?

219
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,177
What do we do, guys?

220
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:45,008
I’m so scared.

221
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,840
I think we should call off this plan.

222
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,733
Even Jo can tell it’s him.

223
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,044
Don’t worry in advance.

224
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,275
Don’t worry in advance?

225
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,644
Seriously?

226
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,631
I’m going up now.

227
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:17,417
Brilliant.

228
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,493
Hey, why aren’t you sitting at your own desk, Tae?

229
00:15:32,191 --> 00:15:34,448
I didn’t get enough sleep.

230
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,871
That was just a trial run.

231
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:45,382
A trial run, my ass.

232
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,448
Keep a close eye on your mentors.

233
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,933
Don’t let them come to the editing room.

234
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:57,933
How about this?

235
00:16:58,466 --> 00:16:59,640
Let’s see.

236
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,315
Where are you going, Jane?

237
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,351
I’m going to the editing room to get the hard disk.

238
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,928
I’m going to the editing room to get the hard disk.

239
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,048
They haven’t brought it to me. I need it urgently.

240
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:15,328
Let me get it for you.

241
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:19,604
That’s okay. I also need to talk to the editing team.

242
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,928
Code Red. Jane is on his way to the editing room.

243
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:30,342
Calm down, guys.

244
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,480
There’s still me.

245
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:32,680
I’ll hold him off.

246
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,026
It’s going to take so damn long.

247
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,746
Ouch!

248
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,542
How did I sprain my legs?

249
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,582
Anything I can help with?

250
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,875
I’m fine.

251
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,173
Damn it.

252
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,604
I couldn’t hold Jane off in time.

253
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,804
Ba-Mhee!

254
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,724
You wasted too much time doing your makeup.

255
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,262
Pah, Jane seemed to be in a rush.

256
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,591
Why are you guys freaking out?

257
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:41,800
I got this.

258
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:45,080
Tae, if anyone asks anything, tell me the answer right away.

259
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,080
Fine, I’ll tell you ASAP, okay?

260
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,570
Are you going to the IT mall or the beach?

261
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,217
Shit. Sorry.

262
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,297
Have you put on a helmet?

263
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:55,372
Really, Ba-Mhee?

264
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,488
Do you want him to stop on the way and buy one?

265
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,631
Hey,

266
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,635
I haven’t received the footage from yesterday’s filming.

267
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,133
Oh, shit.

268
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,991
What? I asked Tae to bring it to you.

269
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,542
Tae, give it to him.

270
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,342
It’s the No. 2 hard disk where I asked you to arrange the footage.

271
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,657
What should I do, Pie? Help me.

272
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:30,742
I thought you said you got this.

273
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,862
Have you put on a helmet, babe?

274
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,791
Tell him you’re brushing up the format.

275
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:56,724
I’m brushing my teeth.

276
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:57,151
Huh?

277
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,502
Not brushing teeth. Brush up the format.

278
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:03,488
It means converting the file.

279
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:04,697
I’m converting the file.

280
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:05,391
Oh.

281
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,902
Okay.

282
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,604
Please bring it to me when you’re done.

283
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,697
I will.

284
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:13,844
Thank you.

285
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,013
Have you put on a helmet, babe?

286
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:40,893
Ba-Mhee.

287
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,377
Can you help me with the thank you gifts for the clients?

288
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:46,173
I’ll send you the client list.

289
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,488
Have a look and see what we should give according to each brand’s lifestyle.

290
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,342
How about helmets?

291
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:51,240
Huh?

292
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:52,093
No.

293
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,244
How about hampers,

294
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,857
coffee cups, scented candles, or notebooks?

295
00:20:58,893 --> 00:20:59,826
What should we go with?

296
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:02,973
Give me something new to impress the clients.

297
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,115
I have an idea.

298
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,902
How about we create a short thank you clip to impress them?

299
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,048
I’ll check with the editing team to see if they have the bandwidth to help us.

300
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:13,995
I’ll check with the editing team.

301
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,426
I’ll check with the editing team.

302
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,066
I’ll go.

303
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,502
I want to handle this.

304
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,995
I want to do it.

305
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,111
Sure.

306
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,231
You could’ve just told me you wanted to see your boyfriend.

307
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,373
(How to convert file)

308
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,964
Excuse me, do you have any editing availability?

309
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,817
Judy wants to make a thank you clip for the clients.

310
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,262
Oh, we should be available next week.

311
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:54,093
I’ll let Tae do it.

312
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,090
Let me put it on the calendar.

313
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,782
Thanks.

314
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,640
Hey, what’s the hurry?

315
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,933
Normally, you’d come in and feed Tae.

316
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,582
Are you guys fighting?

317
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,186
Babe, would you like some water?

318
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,333
Drink some water.

319
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,466
Drink more.

320
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:43,604
You better drink more.

321
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,924
You’re the best.

322
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Hey, how do I convert a file?

323
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:53,328
I don’t know.

324
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,457
But I think you made a typo.

325
00:22:58,653 --> 00:22:59,693
Idiot.

326
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,946
Everyone, listen up.

327
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,306
It’s code red again.

328
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,875
The art team is still looking for Pah.

329
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,395
I told them he had diarrhea.

330
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,040
They need two people to help with the test shoot.

331
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,460
Where are you, Ba-Mhee? Come with me.

332
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,035
Okay. I’m coming.

333
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:18,502
Ryan, try to hold Jane off for as long as you can.

334
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,333
Don’t let him out of sight.

335
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,937
I can’t stand the paint smell.

336
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,920
If you hadn’t dropped the hard disk, you wouldn’t be standing here smelling it.

337
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,857
What are you girls fighting about?

338
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:48,662
Are you both on period?

339
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:51,040
What does our period have to do with it?

340
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,200
Come on. I can’t even joke with young people these days.

341
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,048
Please help us with the test shoot.

342
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,040
Go change your outfits first.

343
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,111
Can’t I make a little joke?

344
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:11,924
This is a test for the water splash shot.

345
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,995
Water will splash on both of you from the side.

346
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,177
I’ll shoot in slow motion.

347
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,333
Ready?

348
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:19,417
3, 2, 1.

349
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,160
Action!

350
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,284
Oh! That’s quite a view.

351
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,666
Bring them towels.

352
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,457
This is great.

353
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,066
We only needed one take.

354
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:48,751
You two can change back now.

355
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,235
Thank you so much.

356
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,737
Come on, Uncle.

357
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,324
Only one take?

358
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,822
I couldn’t take a proper look yet.

359
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,560
That’s enough.

360
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,640
Come on.

361
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:05,302
I haven’t done anything to them.

362
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,195
Hey, watch your mouth.

363
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,924
Calm down, girl.

364
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,377
I tease you because you’re cute.

365
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,702
But your actions are not a compliment.

366
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,955
Hold on. I think you’re overthinking.

367
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:22,271
Don’t bullshit me.

368
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,822
Excuse me, those words and actions are harassment.

369
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:28,297
I haven’t even touched you.

370
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,133
Stop it.

371
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,702
I apologize for my team member.

372
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,057
He talks like no one has taught him.

373
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,462
I’ll make sure he learns his lesson.

374
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,680
You can change back into your outfits.

375
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,395
Thanks for coming to help.

376
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:51,844
Watch your mouth.

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,306
Would you like it if someone teased your mom like that?

378
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:58,182
He needs a slap.

379
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,777
Or he won’t improve.

380
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,480
What is it?

381
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,408
Nothing.

382
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:30,450
Why do I have to deal with this?

383
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,595
No matter how hard I work, I end up losing to those foul-mouthed guys.

384
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:45,960
You’re not losing to anyone.

385
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,431
You were amazing earlier.

386
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,902
I’m serious. Why are you laughing?

387
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,831
Do you want to untie it yourself, you crazy?

388
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,248
I’m just not used to hearing you say something nice.

389
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,240
Excuse me?

390
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,031
   I dared to speak up because I might not get to come back here tomorrow.

391
00:27:31,204 --> 00:27:33,200
   I was called to talk about yesterday’s incident.

392
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,693
Okay. See you.

393
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,035
Pie.

394
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,920
Stay and talk to me this evening about yesterday.

395
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,102
My friends at the faculty say I’m only good at contests but can’t handle real work.

396
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,848
Honestly, what others say about me is probably true.

397
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,995
When I said you’re amazing, I really meant it.

398
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,995
When you were assigned to Unit B, I was watching the monitor the whole time.

399
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,755
You were really amazing.

400
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,564
You’re talented.

401
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,680
No matter where you go, you’re talented.

402
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,537
But if you ask me, I want you to stay with us.

403
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,182
Stop it.

404
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,822
Don’t cry.

405
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,155
I can’t see people’s tears or I’ll cry too.

406
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,551
Stop it right now.

407
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Then don’t look at me.

408
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,773
Don’t look at me.

409
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,631
(Ryan: Pie, Baimon said you can see him in the meeting room now.)

410
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,848
Jane, I’ve already told Pie.

411
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,368
Okay. Thanks.

412
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,217
What are you looking for?

413
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,080
Can I help?

414
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,720
Can you help me find the box with the 2020 label?

415
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:21,364
2020?

416
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,217
2000.

417
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,217
Jane,

418
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,426
I’m going to talk to Pie now.

419
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:04,380
Come with me.

420
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,057
What’s wrong with you, Tae?

421
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:15,382
Why are you taking so long?

422
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,071
Why haven’t you finished arranging the files?

423
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,537
Is Tae dead?

424
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:19,871
What’s taking him so long?

425
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:21,364
Pah, you jerk.

426
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,760
Don’t put a curse on my boyfriend.

427
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,813
Pie is not here anymore.

428
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,810
Are we all getting fired?

429
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,102
Ba-Mhee, can you please get a hold of Tae?

430
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,084
Tae, what are you doing?

431
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:33,284
Let me see your work.

432
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:35,862
Hey.

433
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,466
Hey.

434
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,253
I couldn’t get the hard disk fixed.

435
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,933
What? Why not?

436
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,782
Damn. It’s Tae from another multiverse.

437
00:32:39,302 --> 00:32:41,300
What do you think about yesterday?

438
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,062
It was my fault.

439
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,284
I was mad that Jane didn’t let me help run the set.

440
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,400
  Get an aunty extra here, please.

441
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:00,004
Reset this for me.

442
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:04,470
How could you let the extra go out to buy coffee?

443
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,795
 I told you they have to be on standby here.

444
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:08,582
  Can’t you do this easy task?

445
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,440
I was mad about being assigned to a small unit.

446
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,151
 1 Kaphrao with squid, please.

447
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,484
  We’ve run out of squid.

448
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:20,431
 No squid? Then, how can you find ink for printing?

449
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,110
I was really too confident.

450
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,795
I thought I was smart.

451
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,875
So before letting the extra leave, I didn’t ask anyone.

452
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,382
I’m really sorry.

453
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:45,533
Pie, being confident is not wrong.

454
00:33:45,968 --> 00:33:48,022
How could you work without confidence?

455
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,840
But we’re working as a team.

456
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,404
You can be confident in your ideas but you also need to check with others.

457
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,133
And Jane had a reason why he assigned you to run Unit B.

458
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:05,130
Do you want to tell her yourself?

459
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,755
He asked you to run Unit B as a trial before your real project.

460
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,164
For the next TVC shoot, you’ll be a second Assistant Director after Jane.

461
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,155
You mean,

462
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,333
you’ll make me his actual assistant?

463
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,848
Of course.

464
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:46,022
Jane trusts you, which is why he asked you to run Unit B.

465
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,826
It’s important work. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked you to do it yourself.

466
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,448
She’s crying.

467
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:14,600
Even though Unit B is small,

468
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:17,060
it produced 3 out of 20 shots.

469
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,111
It’s not wrong to be confident in yourself, but we should double-check with each other

470
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,537
because we’re working as a team.

471
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,831
We’re on the same team. Got it?

472
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,862
Your face is contorted now.

473
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,502
Thank you.

474
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:42,600
I’ll remember this day for the rest of my life.

475
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:52,617
Thank you.

476
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,320
I was the one who dropped it.

477
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,497
I started all of this.

478
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,382
But I came up with the plan.

479
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,380
It’s not something to be proud of, Pah.

480
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,017
It’s not the time to play around.

481
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,555
What the hell did you guys do?

482
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,355
Did you think you’re in a spy movie?

483
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,906
It’s my fault alone.

484
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:19,248
They didn’t do anything.

485
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,422
They just came up with a plan so I could go out and get it fixed.

486
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:23,488
That’s what you guys did wrong.

487
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,177
Do you think I’m angry with you for dropping the hard disk?

488
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,560
Every hard disk has a backup.

489
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,542
If it’s broken, I have the backup.

490
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,946
To get it fixed, I only need to take it to the repair center.

491
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,448
Our office has bought hundreds of disks.

492
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,075
Did you think we don’t have a warranty?

493
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:52,111
Does this mean you’re no longer angry with Tae?

494
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,813
I’m angry that you guys acted without thinking.

495
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:59,622
If any files leaked when you took the hard disk out, you’d be sued, Tae.

496
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,351
And you’re just as bad.

497
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:06,244
You skipped work to cosplay here.

498
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:08,706
Your mentors have been searching for you all over the office.

499
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,297
I’m sorry.

500
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,897
We’re so stupid.

501
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,906
From now on, if there’s any problem, I’ll tell you first.

502
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,022
You’re not stupid, Tae.

503
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,422
Neither are you, Pah.

504
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,737
You can’t know everything.

505
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,368
You guys are interns.

506
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,057
Because you don’t know, you’re here to get training.

507
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,160
Why did you take the helmet from your rider though?

508
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,706
I bought it on the way.

509
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,031
Mhee will love you so much for this.

510
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,817
Was I as mad as you guys when I interned?

511
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:20,982
Huh?

512
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,080
What second?

513
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,850
She said, “I’m going to be a second Assistant Director.”

514
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,008
What? Really?

515
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,680
That’s amazing, Pie.

516
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,435
Well done.

517
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:38,253
Well done.

518
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:45,471
Are you okay?

519
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,470
How can anyone understand what you say?

520
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,488
Translate it among yourselves.

521
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,088
“Thank you. Love you the most.”

522
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,013
I just translated what my friend said.

523
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,333
What are we going to do with Pie?

524
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,671
You want to make her a second Assistant Director but she let the extra go home.

525
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:35,524
Is she really up for it?

526
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:37,746
Let’s look at it from two perspectives.

527
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:42,013
Yes, she made a mistake, but I was also wrong for not talking to her first.

528
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,395
The other point is,

529
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,040
I think she’s talented.

530
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:47,551
She knows how to work,

531
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,617
so I want to give her another chance.

532
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:53,515
Alright then.

533
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:07,320
Ouch!

534
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,333
What’s wrong?

535
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,528
I hit my head on the rack.

536
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,235
Apply some medicine.

537
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:25,435
I have it in my bag.

538
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:26,555
Me too.

539
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,102
Do you have it?

540
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:35,870
If not, use mine.

541
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,951
I can’t find it, Ryan.

542
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:56,288
I put it in my bag but I can’t find it. Where is it?

543
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,973
(Ryan After Work)

544
00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:05,880
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

545
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,057
(@Ryan, how’s your head?)

546
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:10,066
(It’s okay. I’m fine now.)

547
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,662
(Wait, what happened?)

548
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,333
(Oh, I hit my head.)

549
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,195
(It’s nothing. I was just clumsy and hit my head on the rack.)

550
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:23,977
(@Tae, what do they make you do for your editing internship?)

551
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:26,644
(Right. I’ve never asked you that, babe.)

552
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:29,604
(A lot. Let me explain like this.)

553
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,644
(First, I receive footage and convert it to smaller files for easier editing.)

554
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,040
(Then I put them in separate folders based on the scene numbers on the slate.)

555
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,560
 (Then I arrange them according to the storyboard and add sound effects.)

556
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:48,706
(Something like that.)

557
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,875
(Wow. You’re so talented, babe. My boyfriend is so cool.)

558
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,346
(Wow. That sounds difficult.)

559
00:41:55,391 --> 00:42:01,257
(Every team deals with difficult tasks, but Tae’s handles the final work before it gets to the audience.)

560
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,475
(Not only do they have to be creative, but they also have to solve problems.)

561
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:08,928
 (So that’s how you spell ‘convert files’. No wonder I only found search results about ‘fire’.)

562
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,728
(Why do I have a friend like you?)

563
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,951
Someone Baimon knows wants to make a music video.

564
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:19,746
I’ll send you the song so you can listen to it and come up with ideas for pitching.

565
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,813
Excuse me, Jane.

566
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:22,810
Could you look at my ideas for the MV?

567
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,413
If you can only come up with shallow ideas,

568
00:42:24,457 --> 00:42:26,528
you might as well sit back and do nothing until it’s time to get off work.

569
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,991
I’ll fix it.

570
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,577
Or you can ask your intern friends to do it.

571
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
You’re so cool, Judy.

572
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,280
I want to be pretty and talented like you.

573
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,626
How are you holding up with interning at the same place as me?

574
00:42:40,662 --> 00:42:43,951
We intern at the same place but we don’t get to see each other.

575
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,631
Hang in there.

576
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:46,875
It’ll be over in three months.
