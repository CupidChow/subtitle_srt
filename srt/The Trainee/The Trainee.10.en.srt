1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,300
If I told you

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,080
I want to get to know you better,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,960
would you be okay with that?

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,540
I didn’t say I’m not okay with it.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,450
Nine, what brings you here?

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,960
Let’s grab something to eat together.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,970
I want to talk with you.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,120
It’s his ex.

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,300
Something must be going on for him to come back to Jane today.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,110
I want you to co-direct it with me.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,940
Do you still want to be a director?

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,670
How do you feel about me?

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,930
I don’t hug anyone I don’t have feelings for.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,590
(Ryan)

15
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:04,750
Hello?

16
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,409
Who’s here, Dad?

17
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,779
Look up a bit.

18
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,169
Good.

19
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:14,969
Oh, there you are.

20
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:16,859
A senior from your office came to get his photos taken.

21
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:17,889
Go help him with his clothes.

22
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,179
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,949
I was in the neighborhood, so I wanted to pick you up.

24
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:47,429
I didn’t know what to tell your dad, so I just went with it.

25
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,349
Are you ready? I’m ready here.

26
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,019
An, turn off the light.

27
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:55,999
Okay.

28
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,619
Young man, give me a smile.

29
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,599
Smile.

30
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,799
Ready?

31
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:09,829
Good. 1, 2, 3.
EP 10: INTERN’S MAGICAL POWERS

32
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,039
1 WEEK AFTER TAE AND BA-MHEE BROKE UP

33
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:19,879
Do you want to go eat Somtam on the side street?

34
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,709
Where?

35
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,079
On the street behind us.

36
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:22,989
At the end of the street?

37
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:23,709
That’s right.

38
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,219
Walk past the motorbike taxis and go straight.

39
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,199
Ah.

40
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,129
But it’s not very—

41
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,719
Well, well, aren’t you late?

42
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:33,419
What’s so funny?

43
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,239
Having a lot of fun, huh?

44
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:36,049
No, not this arm.

45
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:36,859
It’s injured.

46
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,719
Ouch!

47
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,889
Oh, please.

48
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,119
How could you hurt an injured person?

49
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:57,279
Come help me carry these.

50
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:58,839
Hurry.

51
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,069
Tae, what are you doing here?

52
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,899
He’s heartbroken.

53
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:19,019
What does being heartbroken have to do with being here?

54
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,619
Does he want to move to the art team?

55
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,399
After he got his heart broken, he has nowhere to be.

56
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,399
He follows me everywhere.

57
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:33,049
The editing room hasn’t given him work, so he’s free and distracted.

58
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,439
That’s why he asked to come with me.

59
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,199
Come on, Tae.

60
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,839
You won’t die from a heartbreak.

61
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,049
Think on the bright side.

62
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,049
You got your freedom.

63
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,479
Have you tried living life on your own?

64
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:54,429
I have.

65
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,209
I’ve tried watching movies alone.

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,169
Eating alone.

67
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:19,859
Tae.

68
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,489
Leave it there. I’ll eat it later.

69
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,129
I’ve tried going out and doing things on my own

70
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,589
but all I can think about is her.

71
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,769
I’m all alone.

72
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,369
Your friend is down bad.

73
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,709
Ba-Mhee, have you seen this?

74
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,439
What’s our company called?

75
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:41,949
It’s ‘good pick’.

76
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,429
You missed an ‘o’ and wrote ‘god pick’ instead.

77
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,609
This is not good, Ba-Mhee.

78
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,229
I’m sorry.

79
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,999
Okay. Redo this for me and make sure all the names are correct.

80
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,019
Please check everything.

81
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,249
How can you move on when you keep doing this?

82
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,389
I still miss her.

83
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,179
Come to think of it,

84
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,299
I’ve never made any effort for her.

85
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,289
Tell me honestly,

86
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:27,379
if you could turn back time or get another chance,

87
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,499
what would you like to do for her?

88
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,839
Who do you like in the sequel?

89
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,079
Joker?

90
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,019
Who do I like?

91
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,619
I know who you like.

92
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:18,689
Baimon.

93
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,079
You’re just rambling.

94
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,549
I like no one.

95
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,559
You were talking about Batman, right? I like Harvey Dent.

96
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,369
What? Really?

97
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,409
I like him too.

98
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,709
When I watched it in the cinema, people only talked about Joker when we left.

99
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,709
Not a single person talked about Harvey Dent.

100
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:43,149
I asked like 10 friends and they all talked about Joker.

101
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,959
(Why did you laugh?)

102
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,879
(Who do you like?)

103
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,619
(I like no one. I’m not into hero movies.)

104
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:55,109
(I think you like the villain.)

105
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,349
(Are you picking on me?)

106
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,299
(It's open to interpretation.)

107
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:03,129
Hey, is the internet slow for you today too?

108
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,089
You’re right.

109
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,279
It seems slow.

110
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,959
(Hahaha.)

111
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:21,959
(Go to the printer.)

112
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,959
(Hi, Ryan.)

113
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,449
(Jane, aren’t you wasting paper?)

114
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:24,159
(I’ll take it home to recycle and use it for drafting work ideas.)

115
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,439
(What work? Can I help come up with ideas?)

116
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,499
(How can you help me think of anything?)

117
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,879
(At least, I can think of you.)

118
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,019
(You’re cheeky.)

119
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:13,019
(Pie, print the shot we discussed the other day.)

120
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:14,579
(Maybe we can try the blocking this afternoon.)

121
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,849
(Use the paper for reuse. It’s only for internal reference.)

122
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:36,849
(Hi, Ryan.)

123
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,569
Is this correct?

124
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:01,139
Oh, I already ordered flowers for the client.

125
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:02,439
Okay.

126
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,319
This is good to go. Well done.

127
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:24,979
(I want to eat Somtam. Please come with me.)

128
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,229
(Yay! I want to eat it too.)

129
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,359
(Just the two of us, okay? I need to gossip about the client.)

130
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,229
(Okay. Come down. I’m at the reception.)

131
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,189
Let’s go. I’ve booked a Teppanyaki restaurant.

132
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,599
The food is very tasty there. You’ll love it.

133
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:51,259
Let’s go.

134
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,549
Okay.

135
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,419
Once you’ve opened a juice bottle, you should finish it in one go.

136
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:06,119
Leaving it for later makes the nutrients go away.

137
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,539
Throw it away. I’ll get you a new one.

138
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,049
Let’s go.

139
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:29,319
Pah,

140
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,059
is your friend heartbroken or possessed by a ghost?

141
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,859
He’s been sitting still for a while now.

142
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,439
A ghost wouldn’t even be able to talk to him.

143
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,149
I don’t know what to do anymore.

144
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,809
He can’t be alone at all.

145
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:42,979
He sticks with me all the time.

146
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,449
He’s down bad.

147
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:52,579
Ba-Mhee is here.

148
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:53,289
What?

149
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,909
Ba-Mhee. Where?

150
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:55,639
Where is she?

151
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,779
You idiot. I was just testing you.

152
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,439
I wanted to know if you’re still alive.

153
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:01,579
That’s all.

154
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,159
Don’t joke like that.

155
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,579
You know all I can think about is her.

156
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:15,949
Hey, honestly,

157
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,979
if you still can’t forget her, why don’t you try talking to her again?

158
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:22,589
Agreed.

159
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,469
Win her back. Just try.

160
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,149
I don’t think she’s waiting for me anymore.

161
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,389
Have you tried?

162
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:35,519
Try first.

163
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,609
Trust me.

164
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,759
Try doing something you never thought you’d do in your life.

165
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:47,339
No matter the outcome, you’ll have done your best.

166
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,339
Can I have some? That was so spicy.

167
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:13,729
Tae knows I don’t like vegetables.

168
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,629
He would always eat them for me.

169
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,859
What’s wrong?

170
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,149
What did you eat with Judy? Did it taste bad?

171
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:43,609
What’s wrong?

172
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,609
She’s so good to you, isn’t she?

173
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:53,489
Of course. She’s very good.

174
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,399
Tae never paid me this much attention or took care of me like this.

175
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,729
Then why are you confused?

176
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,729
I don’t know.

177
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,149
She pays too much attention.

178
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,099
I know she’s worried about me, but sometimes I don’t want to do what she wants.

179
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,009
Then what do you want to do?

180
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,859
I don’t know.

181
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:21,589
Oh?

182
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:26,609
I don’t even know if I’m into women or men right now.

183
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,329
I don’t think it matters what gender you’re into.

184
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:45,239
You’re confused because you still have feelings for Tae.

185
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,829
Hand me a time machine.

186
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:20,739
To where?

187
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:25,339
Jane, move a bit closer to Ryan.

188
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:31,319
Pie, let me see the board.

189
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,099
Move your face close to Ryan.

190
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:42,689
Okay.

191
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:44,939
Now, walk to the right of the frame, Jane.

192
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,569
Move right.

193
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,569
I moved right.

194
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:55,199
Did you mean the left of the frame?

195
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:56,879
What’s this hand?

196
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,469
Right hand.

197
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,239
That means he should move right.

198
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,269
Wait, where is he supposed to go again?

199
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:02,349
That’s the left of the frame.

200
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,159
Left of the frame. Yes.

201
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,699
If he had listened in the beginning, he would’ve understood.

202
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,239
When did Pie become close with Prang?

203
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,369
They surprisingly get along very well.

204
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,399
What about you? You’ve been interning for a while now.

205
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,919
Have you become close friends with anyone?

206
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,099
I’ve made good friends here.

207
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:37,469
It’s nice. Other than Taohu, I wasn’t close with anyone else

208
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:39,059
because I don’t know that many people.

209
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,719
Don’t you have friends at university?

210
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,139
How have you survived until now?

211
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,699
This morning, Pie told me about her university.

212
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,719
It sounds so fun. She has many talented friends.

213
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:04,679
In her class, six people want to become directors.

214
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,889
Unlike me, who just shows up to study and goes home.

215
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,439
Sometimes, I’m jealous.

216
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,679
I wish I had a dream I could be proud of like the others.

217
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:19,709
What’s wrong with not having big dreams?

218
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:24,409
Why must people want to become something big?

219
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,389
But at least, we should do something better than others,

220
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:34,729
like having a special talent.

221
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,339
What do you mean by special talent?

222
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:46,889
Like being a director, a cameraman, or talented like adults.

223
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,029
How are the adults talented?

224
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,149
Baimon couldn’t even tell left from right.

225
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,679
Moo doesn’t know how to use a MacBook.

226
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,689
Ball the cameraman just ordered car accessories from Japan

227
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,169
and got swindled for 60,000 baht.

228
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:05,169
Prang the PM is afraid of dogs.

229
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,179
Now tell me,

230
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,919
which one of the adults is talented?

231
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,639
Even your friend whom you call so talented…

232
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,839
Pie, come help me here.

233
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,839
I’m not going to drink this anymore.

234
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:24,789
Please keep it.

235
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,567
Hurry up.

236
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,741
(At least, I can think of you.)

237
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,145
(Why are you so extra, Ryan? Hahahaha.)

238
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,172
Hey, stop!

239
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,169
Go help, Pie.

240
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,319
It’s okay. We got this.

241
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,474
Pah, I have an idea.

242
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,319
I want to create a scene from a movie I watched with Ba-Mhee

243
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:22,892
but I’d probably need a lot of people.

244
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,514
You’ve come to the right person, Tae.

245
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,509
With my help, you have nothing to be afraid of.

246
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,425
Your help is what I’m afraid of.

247
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,816
Don’t underestimate me, child.

248
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:38,456
I may seem like a loser, but I have a lot of connections.

249
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,699
A whole army of people is ready to help you.

250
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:03,265
You need me

251
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,323
and these people, Tae.

252
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:11,221
Come on. Let’s go and fight.

253
00:22:14,554 --> 00:22:15,381
Could you let go?

254
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:16,225
Please let go.

255
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,123
My back hurts.

256
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:27,969
No worries at all, Ms. Pim.

257
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:29,727
It’s my pleasure.

258
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,034
Alright. Happy Birthday again.

259
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,532
See you soon.

260
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,776
Bye.

261
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,274
Looking for your pink pillow?

262
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:48,803
I sent it out for washing.

263
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,976
I was sending the blazer I kept here

264
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:56,163
and noticed the pillow had been here for a while.

265
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,181
It was accumulating dust, you know?

266
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,532
And the fluff can get stuck to your clothes.

267
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,529
If you don’t believe me, just look.

268
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,936
Here it is.

269
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:16,110
Actually, you could’ve told me you were going to send it for washing.

270
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:20,252
I was in a hurry and thought the pillow needed washing anyway,

271
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,532
so I didn’t mention it.

272
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,465
Oh, Ms. Pim called to thank us.

273
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,459
She said she really loved the flowers

274
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,581
and even took a picture with them in front of the backdrop.

275
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:36,199
Nice.

276
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,807
Why did you choose daisies and Gypsophila?

277
00:23:42,092 --> 00:23:44,927
Normally, people choose bigger flowers.

278
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,776
Oh, I’ve been stalking Ms. Pim’s Instagram and saw she just had a fitting,

279
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:52,412
so I chose the flowers to match her outfit.

280
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:54,794
Well done.

281
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,181
What’s your favorite flower?

282
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,421
I mean, anything you like.

283
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:11,692
I want to get to know you better.

284
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,176
(Here she comes.)

285
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,994
Now what do we do?

286
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,576
Oh, why is it so messy?

287
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:49,665
Can I help?

288
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:50,447
No, it’s okay.

289
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,763
Please go over there. I got this.

290
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,114
Watch out!

291
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,616
Go left.

292
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,879
Go right.

293
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:57,336
Watch out.

294
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,981
Excuse me.

295
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,510
Excuse me.

296
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,483
Why is the floor so dirty? Excuse me.

297
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,816
Excuse me.

298
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,967
Help us.

299
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:25,976
Let’s go.

300
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:26,874
We’re almost there.

301
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,336
Just a moment.

302
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,074
It’s a little far.

303
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,163
Just as I stopped feeling tired.

304
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,496
Let me get that.

305
00:25:31,523 --> 00:25:33,061
Alright, we’re leaving.

306
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,483
What is this, Tae?

307
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:05,123
Please have a seat.

308
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:13,594
Let me watch too.

309
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,776
Please enjoy your meal.

310
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:40,769
There will be a performance in a moment.

311
00:27:58,429 --> 00:27:59,354
Do you like this?

312
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:11,514
For our anniversary, I booked the restaurant you wanted to try,

313
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,461
but we didn’t get to go there together

314
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,936
so I took Pah and Pie instead.

315
00:28:23,114 --> 00:28:24,510
I just want to tell you that

316
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,847
I didn’t forget our anniversary.

317
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,181
Pah.

318
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:01,239
Pah.

319
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:14,874
Come here!

320
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:16,652
Hurry!

321
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,847
What’s the meaning of this?

322
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:25,256
Can you tell me already?

323
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,159
This is that scene from The Terminal, right?

324
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,634
You remember?

325
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:41,603
How could I forget?

326
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,083
It’s the first movie we watched together.

327
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,145
We secretly watched it at the back of the computer lab.

328
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,563
But Tae,

329
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,612
I don’t want this scene.

330
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,203
I don’t want a grand surprise.

331
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:21,852
I just want time for us to eat and look at each other’s faces like this.

332
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,656
Just time to walk home together.

333
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,019
Just time to talk

334
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,794
and update each other on what’s going on each day.

335
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,339
That’s all I want.

336
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:57,212
More importantly,

337
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,687
I just want us to go back to the way we were.

338
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,861
What about Judy?

339
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,052
I want to get to know you better.

340
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,474
Since that day you talked about someone who’s the right fit,

341
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:03,559
I’ve been thinking every day about who’s the right fit for me

342
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:15,612
and finally realized there’s no one who fits me perfectly in this world.

343
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:21,052
Tae might fit me in some areas.

344
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,772
You might fit me in other areas.

345
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:29,603
But we still have some differences.

346
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,976
The person I prefer despite those differences

347
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:41,425
is still Tae.

348
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,532
I’m still into him.

349
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,959
I’m sorry.

350
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,625
I’m still in love with him.

351
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,567
I get it.

352
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,519
Ba-Mhee,

353
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:16,607
I’m totally fine.

354
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:45,265
Shall we get back together?

355
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:49,559
About the past,

356
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:51,674
I’m sorry.

357
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,465
It’s okay.

358
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,985
It’s my fault too.

359
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,967
Let’s start over.

360
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:40,821
So sweet!

361
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:45,487
Credits to me!

362
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:46,474
Credits to me!

363
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:49,461
So sweet!

364
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,459
This place is quite like a production house.

365
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:25,319
How so?

366
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,283
Well, clients come to hire you.

367
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,603
Then you work on the ideas and production.

368
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,181
After that, you handle post-production

369
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,759
and deliver the final product to the clients.

370
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,603
Come take a look at this.

371
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,763
(Ideas for Baimon’s MV Project)
(When a Gunman Falls in Love With His Victim)

372
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,661
The male lead is a gunman.

373
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:23,061
His target is an introvert,

374
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,879
so he rents a house opposite hers.

375
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:30,439
He watches her every day until he softens and falls for her.

376
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:34,634
Then the male lead’s boss comes to shoot him, so he kills his boss

377
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,261
and helps his target escape with him.

378
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:36,856
The end.

379
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:50,101
You probably don’t like it.

380
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,099
Learn to be confident.

381
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,172
I didn’t say I don’t like it.

382
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:03,514
You said you don’t have any dreams, but your ideas are good.

383
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:16,439
What about you?

384
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:18,430
Do you have any dreams?

385
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:26,394
Well, I used to want to become a director,

386
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:32,154
but life somehow led me here

387
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:35,034
so I didn't know what to do

388
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,136
and stopped thinking about it a long time ago.

389
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:58,590
Jane, you know on my interview day,

390
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,003
I wasn’t saying I wanted to be porridge with side dishes, right?

391
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,999
I want to be like that picture.

392
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,830
You want to be porridge with side dishes?

393
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:10,110
Something plain and bland

394
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,430
but goes well with anything.

395
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:18,572
I just meant I didn't care about being talented or winning awards like others.

396
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:23,816
I just want to sit down and eat or maybe work as an extra,

397
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:27,612
be a small part, just to fill up the frame.

398
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:34,554
But today, I actually want to be porridge with side dishes.

399
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:38,581
I want to know what suits me best.

400
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,883
I’m starting to wonder which Ryan I am:

401
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:49,141
the soldier, the footballer, or the actor.

402
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:56,616
Or maybe I’m the new Ryan who’s not based on anyone.

403
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,430
I’ve started wanting to be really proud of myself

404
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:04,163
since I began my internship

405
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,256
and met you.

406
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,772
I don’t know if anyone has told you this

407
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:21,079
but to me, you’re so cool.

408
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:33,292
By the way, Jane,

409
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:37,114
you had a big smile in the photos you took this morning.

410
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,687
I don’t know if they’re okay to use.

411
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,372
Here.

412
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,394
What were you thinking then?

413
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,990
Are you ready? I’m ready here.

414
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:57,529
An, turn off the light.

415
00:39:57,825 --> 00:39:58,447
Okay.

416
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,203
Smile.

417
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:05,141
Good. 1, 2.

418
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,954
Great.

419
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,252
Let’s take one more.

420
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:26,172
(Ryan After Work)

421
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,070
(Are you home yet, Jane?)

422
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:30,949
(What?)

423
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:34,149
(Are you trying to be cute?)

424
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:37,309
(I’m home.)

425
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,129
(Just parked my car.)

426
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:42,599
(By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask you something since the other day.)

427
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:44,599
(The last time we were on set,)

428
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:48,190
(I noticed the camera crew worked so quickly.)

429
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:52,056
(I didn’t know that so many people are involved with one camera.)

430
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,105
(Yes.)

431
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,576
(The main person is called the DOP.)

432
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,154
(It’s short for Director of Photography.)

433
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,016
(They have assistants,)

434
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,390
(similar to Assistant Directors.)

435
00:41:03,425 --> 00:41:05,389
(Let me show you a clip in just a moment.)

436
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:10,447
(The First Assistant Camera is the focus puller)

437
00:41:10,483 --> 00:41:12,367
(who adjusts the visual clarity.)

438
00:41:12,412 --> 00:41:17,061
(This person needs to anticipate the camera operator’s timing and the focus point.)

439
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:19,799
(Then there’s the Second Assistant Camera and the rest of the crew.)

440
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,181
(They handle tasks like changing the lenses, moving the camera,)

441
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,909
(connecting it to the monitor, and so on.)

442
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,927
(This helps save time and ensure that the DOP isn't handling everything alone,)

443
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:29,167
(allowing them to focus as much as possible

444
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:31,603
(and create beautiful frames for the clients.)

445
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:34,447
(Wow.)

446
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,079
(The camera crew must really know each other well.)

447
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:40,083
(I didn’t know they needed to be that detailed.)

448
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,141
(Good. When you don’t know something, just ask.)

449
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:44,812
(It’s late. Go to bed.)

450
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,652
(Okay.)

451
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:49,950
(Good night, Jane.)

452
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:54,216
(I’m going to sleep now.)

453
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,239
(Are you free tomorrow?)

454
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:03,087
(There’s a new movie I want to invite you to see...)

455
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:07,603
(Good night, Ryan.)

456
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,745
(Okay.)

457
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:16,963
You’re into Jane?

458
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:18,527
Since when?

459
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,047
How is that even possible?

460
00:42:20,101 --> 00:42:21,692
Are you really into Jane?

461
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:23,114
Are you sure you two will last?

462
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,043
Why didn’t you tell me?

463
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,679
Does he know you’re into him?

464
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:28,501
Hurry up and decide what you want to do.

465
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:30,003
The internship is almost over.

466
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,550
I called you last night but you didn’t pick up.

467
00:42:31,594 --> 00:42:33,390
Tell me what’s wrong.

468
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:35,185
You know I like you

469
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,179
but I don’t know how you feel at all.

470
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,283
Do you want to be more than just an intern?
