1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,806
Spill.

2
00:00:00,818 --> 00:00:01,526
Everything.

3
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:02,250
Are you two together?

4
00:00:02,958 --> 00:00:04,943
But you talked on the phone for an hour

5
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,589
and said you missed each other.

6
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:07,894
We just keep talking.

7
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:10,878
He hasn’t told me if he likes me or not.

8
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:12,658
Tell me what’s wrong.

9
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,498
You know I like you

10
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,036
but I don’t know how you feel at all.

11
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:20,679
You said you like me. Are you sure about that?

12
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,156
If I wasn’t sure, I wouldn’t have said it.

13
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:25,654
Let’s date.

14
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,418
Why did you choose Nine that day?

15
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,861
Why didn’t you choose me?

16
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,252
Ever since you didn’t choose me,

17
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,828
I’ve been too scared to dream of anything, you know?

18
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:40,838
We’re shooting an MV the day after tomorrow.

19
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,388
You’re almost 30, Jane.

20
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:43,880
Follow your heart already.

21
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:46,200
Whenever you’re ready to follow your dream,

22
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:47,436
you can start here.

23
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:53,238
No matter what I do, will things stay the same between us?

24
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,622
Jane, have you seen this?

25
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,258
(When a Gunman)

26
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,622
(Falls in Love With His Target)

27
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,188
Isn’t this our intern’s idea?

28
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:28,249
Why is it showing here?

29
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:35,031
What were you doing with Nine when you were on leave last week?

30
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:51,929
Hey, Mr. Jane.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,138
Why did they do this?

32
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:55,333
This is your idea, isn’t it?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,022
They copied the whole thing.

34
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:00,532
Hello, Mr. Baimon.

35
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,973
I brought Mr. Jo a gift.

36
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,315
Here.

37
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,582
Oh, do you like the MV teaser?

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,071
I heard Jane’s involved.

39
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:20,948
But since when did Jane become a director at Nine’s production house?

40
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:23,022
I just saw him last Friday.

41
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:25,875
What a shame that he moved.

42
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,471
How crazy.

43
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:32,578
Such a shame, isn’t it?

44
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:38,223
EP 12: INTERNSHIP DIARY

45
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,769
Eat a bit before the noodles get soggy.

46
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:07,407
Yeah.

47
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,538
If a customer waits too long and the noodles get soggy,

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,863
my dad won’t let them eat it.

49
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:15,858
He’d rather make a new one and lose money than serve them soggy noodles.

50
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:17,388
Wait, your family actually has a noodle shop?

51
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:18,452
I thought you were joking.

52
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:19,115
Of course, it’s true.

53
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,383
Why would I lie to you?

54
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,760
My sister is Kiam-Yi.

55
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,718
We’re all named after noodles.

56
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,758
Why is your name Pah, though?

57
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:31,404
Is your name actually not Pah?

58
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,342
What’s your name? Tell us.

59
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,468
I have a funny name.

60
00:04:39,508 --> 00:04:40,512
You don’t need to know.

61
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:42,718
Just tell us.

62
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,076
The funnier, the better.

63
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:53,658
It’s Bak-Ue.

64
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,035
Huh? What’s your name again?

65
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,018
My name is Bak-Ue.

66
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,551
You guys are laughing so hard at this.

67
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,613
Stop it.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,068
My name means pumpkin.

69
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,444
It’s my mom's favorite thing to eat.

70
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:19,093
You can smile now, huh?

71
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:30,772
Hi.

72
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:31,715
Hi.

73
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,822
Hey, the whole office is gossiping about Jane.

74
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:38,185
What exactly is going on? Tell me now.

75
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,915
Did he really sell your work to another production house?

76
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,013
It’s his ex’s company, isn’t it?

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,609
And he’s been absent for a few days now, right?

78
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,342
I haven’t seen him around.

79
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:50,302
Is he back with Nine?

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,238
Whose work did he steal? Was it yours, Pie?

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,898
Or Ryan’s, or someone else’s?

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,035
Hot tea.

83
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:17,888
It’s about Jane.

84
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,378
I heard he stole the intern’s work.

85
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,258
Damn.

86
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:21,031
The audacity.

87
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,658
Will he be able to keep his job?

88
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:32,302
(I’m waiting to hear it from you only. I won’t listen to anyone else.)

89
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,604
(Please come back and explain.)

90
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,782
(Can you please answer? I’m waiting for you, Jane.)

91
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,711
You know, Jane is a very jealous guy.

92
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,898
He’s jealous that Nine was chosen as co-director in the past.

93
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:51,972
And he acts all high and mighty at work.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,758
He thinks he can get away with anything just because he’s under Jo.

95
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:59,049
Yeah, if it weren’t for Jo, Ball would’ve punched him in the face a long time ago.

96
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:02,231
We don’t know the truth yet.

97
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,231
Let’s not talk nonsense.

98
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,422
Are you an intern in the directing department?

99
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,480
Oh, Jane is your mentor.

100
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:15,458
Don’t get too caught up in the idea of a mentor.

101
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:17,546
Jane is just doing his job.

102
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,808
If he doesn’t take care of you, he’ll be scolded.

103
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,398
Also, I heard that Jane quit.

104
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,569
HR told me.

105
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,791
Let’s go.

106
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:29,582
Yeah.

107
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:44,715
LAST DAY OF INTERNSHIP

108
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,692
(Your mentors appreciate your work this semester.)

109
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,373
Where’s Tae and Ba-Mhee?

110
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:23,493
You can go first.

111
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:26,989
I need to fix something quickly and I’ll be done.

112
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:28,578
It should not take more than half an hour.

113
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:40,588
It’s okay. I can wait.

114
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:41,769
Just keep going.

115
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,782
What? Are you done?

116
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:53,529
No.

117
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,080
Forget it.

118
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:57,920
I’ll continue working on it tonight.

119
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:00,829
You can keep working.

120
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,231
I’m really fine.

121
00:09:06,098 --> 00:09:07,715
I know you can wait.

122
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:12,542
From now on, you can talk to me honestly about anything.

123
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,440
I want to do everything for you.

124
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,120
Let’s go.

125
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:34,898
Let’s go.

126
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:48,569
Whenever you are hurt, just call

127
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,898
Uncle Moo, Pie was so fierce that day.

128
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:51,892
She didn’t know how to peel mangosteens,

129
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,351
but she kept squeezing them until her hands went purple.

130
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:55,038
I’m good at peeling them now.

131
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57,555
Bring them to me and I’ll peel 10 kilos for you.

132
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:59,840
No take backs.

133
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,728
Call me, just call

134
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,038
Pah, are you going to keep the mic to yourself?

135
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,031
Let me sing too.

136
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:07,858
Hey!

137
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,022
Great job.

138
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:15,431
I don’t need anything more

139
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:29,049
Can I love you? How many scores do I get

140
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:33,440
What should I do to be with you? I will do it all

141
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,440
Your girlfriend is so crazy, Tae.

142
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,000
How can you two even be together?

143
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,111
Go dance with your friends.

144
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:44,213
Come on.

145
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:46,995
Just go.

146
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,524
She’s on fire. How many kilos is she peeling?

147
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,658
Tae, come dance with us.

148
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:12,275
Uh…

149
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,769
Come on.

150
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:19,449
Take responsibility for stealing my heart

151
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:24,006
I tried to ignore but you got me from the start

152
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:26,720
You’re so cute, that’s clear

153
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,868
But you’re quick to disappear

154
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:29,760
Hey.

155
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:38,475
I’ve never had a friend as genuine as you.

156
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:43,578
Thank you so much for being in my life.

157
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:46,213
Don’t cry.

158
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:54,724
Besides Tae, you’re the only person I’d die for.

159
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:59,924
I’d die for you too.

160
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:01,648
Don’t cry.

161
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:03,738
But you’re quick to disappear

162
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,618
Tell me if you’re into me

163
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:10,058
Don’t be so shady

164
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,315
The mic.

165
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,151
- Give me the mic. - Oh, sorry.

166
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:17,814
Alright.

167
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,705
Oops, sorry.

168
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:26,098
Oh, where’s Jo? Has anyone seen him?

169
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,396
Jo?

170
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:29,567
Jo?

171
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,683
Has anyone seen Jo?

172
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,623
Jo!

173
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:35,206
Huh?

174
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,021
What are you doing, Jo?

175
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:40,490
Give us the honor and say something to the interns.

176
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,683
You say it.

177
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,312
- Go ahead. - Come on up, Jo.

178
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:44,318
You’re our leader.

179
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:45,458
You go ahead.

180
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,748
Come on up and get it over with!

181
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:49,319
Come on!

182
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:51,276
Let’s give it up for him.

183
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:53,938
Come on.

184
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:56,578
It’d be the same if you gave the speech.

185
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:04,272
Well, what should I say?

186
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:12,748
This year, we have a total of five interns, right?

187
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:16,166
I remember the first day we met.

188
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:20,692
I heard none of you were any good.

189
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:26,132
Why do you want to intern here?

190
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,258
Your main responsibility is to organize the footage and sync the sound.

191
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:38,463
When needed, key out green screen footage before showing it to the client.

192
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,012
Do you understand everything I’ve said?

193
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,326
I feel like it’s what I’m really good at.

194
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,246
When you scoop it out, do it like this and avoid touching the seed in the middle,

195
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,588
or the flesh will break.

196
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:52,978
If you scoop it out without touching the seed in the middle, it’ll look perfect.

197
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,960
This is from when I took a course in Japan.

198
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:58,748
Filming this scene was really challenging

199
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:01,195
because we had to plan how to climb the mountain.

200
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:04,646
This one is from when I was on a short film set in China.

201
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,658
And here's a project that’s really interesting.

202
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,680
It’s one I’m really proud of.

203
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:22,431
Honestly, I couldn’t tell if three months later, you’d all get any better.

204
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,098
I just wanted you to find your own path

205
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,724
and see your own worth.

206
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:37,823
From now on, if anyone tells you that you can’t do it

207
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,778
or you’re not right for the job,

208
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,280
don’t believe them.

209
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:46,200
You know yourself best.

210
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:51,469
Today, I can say you guys have done really well.

211
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,606
Thank you for the past three months.

212
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:04,829
Thank you so much.

213
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:06,680
Well done.

214
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:25,240
Well done.

215
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:28,589
You’re amazing.

216
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:31,663
Hey.

217
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,503
Yes, you’re so amazing.

218
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,368
I’m not going!

219
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,172
Pah, walk properly. Our ride will be here soon.

220
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,358
Huh? Where?

221
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,063
Just a moment.

222
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:46,118
Pah.

223
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,763
Pah, wake up.

224
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,995
Pah, we’ve arrived.

225
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,068
Pah!

226
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,618
Which room are you in?

227
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:05,478
Is there anything you want to ask me?

228
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:17,652
Where have you been?

229
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,185
Did you really quit to work with Nine?

230
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:29,345
I only worked with Nine one day on the pitch.

231
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,872
I wasn’t planning to continue.

232
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:34,828
As for…

233
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:43,298
As for the MV, I think you’re misunderstanding me.

234
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,148
Nine!

235
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:48,148
How could you do this?

236
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,208
Why are you so mad?

237
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,038
You always have spare ideas on your laptop, don’t you?

238
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,758
It wasn’t my idea and you should’ve asked for permission.

239
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:58,178
He’s just an intern.

240
00:17:58,554 --> 00:17:59,828
Why make a big deal?

241
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:02,054
Just give him some pocket money and move on.

242
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:05,639
He should be happy to see his ideas come to life.

243
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,279
You never change.

244
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:13,443
You do what you want without considering other people’s feelings.

245
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:18,781
I thought we could at least be friends after breaking up,

246
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,465
but seeing you now,

247
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,098
I don’t even want that.

248
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,723
Aren’t you going to explain this to others?

249
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,021
Are you just going to let them talk nonsense?

250
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,850
Or are you really not okay with Jo anymore?

251
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:52,447
Ever since you didn’t choose me,

252
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,919
I’ve been too scared to dream of anything, you know?

253
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,607
Is it because of me or yourself?

254
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,443
Think carefully.

255
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:11,358
Do you want to keep being in my shadow or become a real director?

256
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,185
Jo and I are not fighting.

257
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:35,020
Jo wants me to walk my own path.

258
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:37,448
Thank you.

259
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:41,029
It’s a reminder that I’m talented enough to step out of my comfort zone now.

260
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:50,836
Besides Jo, you’re the one who makes me want to pursue directing again.

261
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,039
Are you quitting to become a director?

262
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:15,768
(Application for Master’s Degree in Film Production)

263
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,074
I’m flying out the day after tomorrow.

264
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:28,041
You’re not mad that I’m leaving, right?

265
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:45,166
As I said, I’ll support you in every way.

266
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:49,298
Whether you stay or leave,

267
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,542
continue your studies or work elsewhere,

268
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,549
I’ll always cheer you on.

269
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,034
Thank you, Ryan,

270
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,665
for everything.

271
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:47,170
(Over the past three months,)

272
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:52,210
(I’ve really become a porridge with side dishes like I accidentally said on my first day.)

273
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,192
(I don’t know everything,)

274
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,878
(but I’m not stupid.)

275
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,561
(I’m not ready)

276
00:21:58,107 --> 00:21:59,570
(but I’m getting ready.)

277
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,580
(I’m not talented)

278
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,914
(but I’m trying.)

279
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:08,625
(I’m still too young to have clear life goals.)

280
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,629
(I’m only just beginning to learn many different things.)

281
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,834
(From now on,)

282
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,573
(whether I achieve something big in my own way,)

283
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:22,554
(I’ll probably never forget these three months.)

284
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,686
(End of internship.)

285
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:33,709
5 YEARS LATER

286
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,629
How about we go over these boards one by one?

287
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,709
These two boards are telling the same story.

288
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:40,610
How?

289
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:43,669
I thought we’re going to shoot the same way since it’s the same scene.

290
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:47,029
It’s the same scene but the approach will be different.

291
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,568
We’ll need about three more hours.

292
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,438
How about we do this?

293
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,448
Let’s focus more on the product.

294
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,818
You’re so cool, Ryan.

295
00:22:57,838 --> 00:22:59,354
How are you so knowledgeable?

296
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:01,112
Did you see his face earlier?

297
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:03,808
He was shocked when you talked about Day For Night and Night For Day.
(Day For Night (DFN): Use daylight to simulate a nighttime scene)

298
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,206
He was shocked when you talked about Day For Night and Night For Day.
(Night For Day (NFD): Use night lighting to simulate a daytime scene)

299
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,488
You’re great. You’ve figured out what work you want to do early on.

300
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,952
I’m not that great.

301
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,020
Don’t be so modest, Ryan.

302
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:17,172
I ask my 4-year-old son what he wants to do in the future

303
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,723
and all he says is “I don’t know”.

304
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:21,467
There’s no need to rush.

305
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,905
There are so many things he can try.

306
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:28,530
Even if he knows what he wants to do today, that might change tomorrow.

307
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,460
Let him take his time exploring

308
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,173
and he’ll figure out what he wants to do eventually.

309
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,029
Hey, Ryan.

310
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,025
Could you check the printer for me?

311
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:41,978
Hey, Ryan is the creative, not IT support.

312
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,320
You always ask him for favors.

313
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,166
The IT guy is on leave today.

314
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,029
No worries. I’ll have a look.

315
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:52,863
The client is all about looking cool.

316
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:56,446
Whatever I present, he always asks to make it bigger and cooler.

317
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,035
Wow, you’ve upgraded.

318
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:01,547
You complain more about clients these days, you know that?

319
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:04,455
Well, it’s really annoying.

320
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,660
I’ve been here for three years and this project is the most chaotic.

321
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,029
Come on.

322
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:12,403
You’ve complained about every project, but you’ve always gotten through it.

323
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:17,015
Hey, I’ve got to go.

324
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,592
I’m in trouble.

325
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,686
Excuse me.

326
00:24:22,756 --> 00:24:29,278
The client needs to leave early, so they want to shoot the product sooner.

327
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:39,533
I can move that up but we need to finish this scene first.

328
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,839
We need to give the art team time to set up the product shot.

329
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:43,269
I don’t want to rush them too much.

330
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:44,427
Got it.

331
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,989
How are the actors doing?

332
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:08,135
Please wait a moment for my boss to arrive and make a decision.

333
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,166
Sorry I’m late. I was stuck in traffic.

334
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:37,995
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

335
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:41,115
(I’m jealous! How did you guys meet?)

336
00:25:41,128 --> 00:25:43,918
(I want to work with friends too.)

337
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:48,982
(I miss the food on Thai sets so much.)

338
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:52,389
(When I’m back, I’ll binge on beef noodles.)

339
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:55,558
(We’re meeting tomorrow. Don’t bail!)

340
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:56,966
(Okay.)

341
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,743
(Got it.)

342
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,058
(Okay.)

343
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,458
(Okay.)

344
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,268
The production house filming our commercial is here to introduce their new director.

345
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:13,286
He’s worked in Hong Kong for many years

346
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:15,519
and was an Assistant Director for a long time before that.

347
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:17,025
He’s talented.

348
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,321
Hi, everyone.

349
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:41,622
This is Mr. Jane, the director for this project.

350
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:55,738
The new slides you sent have been updated, right?

351
00:26:55,758 --> 00:26:56,295
Yes.

352
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:57,358
Okay.

353
00:26:57,373 --> 00:26:58,088
Ryan.

354
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:04,290
I’ll send you the new slides in a moment and the timeline later.

355
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,025
Wait.

356
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,086
Can I talk to you?

357
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,556
I look forward to your guidance, Mr. Creative.

358
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:49,575
I should be the one saying that, Jane.

359
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:51,269
You’re a director now.

360
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,676
You look much more grown-up.

361
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,025
You’ve changed a lot.

362
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,420
Is there anything that hasn’t changed?

363
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,029
What about you?

364
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,107
Is anything about you still the same?

365
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,269
Everything is the same.

366
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:55,848
Why did he ask to meet so early?

367
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,029
I missed you and wanted to see you as soon as I could.

368
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,305
I got used to waking up early when I was living abroad.

369
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:15,406
I got up early and hurried to see people

370
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,034
because I was so lonely being alone.

371
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:22,102
Then why didn’t you reach out?

372
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,065
I kept waiting for you.

373
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,568
I was scared I’d give in and come back early.

374
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,545
Whenever I thought of you, I wanted to come back.

375
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,069
Can I lean on you?

376
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,978
What kind of mood and tone would you like, Mr. Jane?

377
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,668
Black coffee without sugar, please.

378
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:03,227
Huh?

379
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,526
What did you just say?

380
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:20,783
Black coffee what?

381
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:21,846
I couldn’t think of a good answer in time.

382
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,028
What did you expect me to say?

383
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:24,394
Right?

384
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:31,398
For the waterfall scene, we can use a green screen

385
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:33,655
since it’s a close-up and the expressions won’t be visible anyway.

386
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,333
Are you okay with that, Mr. Ryan?

387
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,368
Good idea.

388
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:45,250
Let’s focus on the product presentation scene.

389
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:49,038
Okay, as for targeting teenagers,

390
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:51,801
I plan to focus on those who vacation at the beach.

391
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:54,298
Do you think that’s enough, Mr. Ryan?

392
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:02,794
I think targeting teenagers who vacation at the beach is enough.

393
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:04,305
Do you think that’s enough, Mr. Ryan?

394
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:09,425
Yes.

395
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:14,528
By the way, your ideas are so romantic, Mr. Jane.

396
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:16,354
You and your wife must be so sweet with each other.

397
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,356
I’m not married.

398
00:31:20,288 --> 00:31:22,119
That’s unbelievable.

399
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,898
You’re so handsome and talented.

400
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,927
What’s your soulmate waiting for?

401
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:27,660
I know, right?

402
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:29,687
I have no idea what that person is waiting for either.

403
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:51,164
What? Baimon never told me Jane was coming back to Thailand.

404
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,026
Baimon didn’t know either.

405
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:55,298
Jane just suddenly came back.

406
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:56,759
I don’t know what he’s thinking.

407
00:31:58,158 --> 00:32:00,663
Don’t act like you don’t know what he’s thinking.

408
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:04,258
I bet you ran to scream in the toilet after you saw him.

409
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:07,026
Hi, guys.

410
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:13,132
I got you souvenirs from Japan.

411
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,892
I was there for three months but only got to buy them on my last day.

412
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:16,715
Thank you.

413
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:17,346
Yeah.

414
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:22,395
Ever since you became Art Director for foreign films, you’re never in Thailand.

415
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,124
Yeah, I fly all the time.

416
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,244
By the way, is Jane really back?

417
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:34,898
How many more times do I have to retell this story?

418
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:36,966
I want to know.

419
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,040
You don’t need to.

420
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:38,636
What?

421
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:43,463
Tell me.

422
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,471
Hey.

423
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:48,508
What’s wrong with you guys now?

424
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,340
Same old problem.

425
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:52,548
Jealousy.

426
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,558
Mhee, you’re probably the only one misguided enough to fall for Tae.

427
00:32:58,578 --> 00:32:59,554
Stop being jealous.

428
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,028
Your friend is the jealous one, not me.

429
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,266
I went to lunch with my client and he’s been sulking until evening.

430
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:11,948
I’ll go get some stuff from the car.

431
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,868
Pah asked me to buy it for him.

432
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah.

433
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:30,204
By the way, guys, the brand Judy works with has a lot of money.

434
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:35,435
And everyone I told about interning with her is jealous of me.

435
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,468
You’ve been talking about Judy since you got here.

436
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:40,108
You’re not thinking about her that way again, are you?

437
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,006
Come on. What could I even think about?

438
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:43,954
I spend all my time fighting with Tae.

439
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,140
But fighting with him is the most fun.

440
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:58,958
Whoa, this song is so old.

441
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:01,394
I sent it to flirt with Tae when we were in school.

442
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:05,358
Wait, should I propose to Tae now?

443
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,884
What do you think?

444
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,078
Are you crazy?

445
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:09,260
You’re a girl. Tae should be the one proposing to you.

446
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,610
I don’t know.

447
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:25,868
Eyes connect briefly, can people fall in love?

448
00:34:25,892 --> 00:34:28,509
Just a fleeting moment

449
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:32,370
Would that be enough?

450
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:38,418
If two people are alike and have things in common

451
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:45,069
Would they quickly form a strong bond?

452
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:51,948
Someone you meet on a day you feel vulnerable

453
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:55,698
Would it be easier and faster when you fall?

454
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,668
You wanna marry?

455
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,172
Marry who?

456
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:02,402
Finish the sentence.

457
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,036
What do you think?

458
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:09,468
Marry me, of course.

459
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:14,775
Will you marry me?

460
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:24,802
You make me want to explore

461
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:28,078
My eyes yearn to see you more

462
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:31,298
You got me lost in a distant land

463
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:35,046
Too far to reach or understand

464
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:41,846
No matter how near or far

465
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,315
I’d do anything to be there in youniverse

466
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,466
Why didn’t you let me in on your plan, Tae?

467
00:35:48,658 --> 00:35:50,402
Congratulations!

468
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:12,983
How can I help you?

469
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:14,914
Is Jo here?

470
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:15,719
Yes.

471
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:17,847
Here you go.

472
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:24,748
Thanks.

473
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,386
Is Moo here?

474
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:04,060
Who?

475
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,039
Oh, sorry.

476
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:32,703
Sure. Is it 25,000 net?

477
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:37,874
Oh, okay.

478
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:40,455
Should I pay on set or…?

479
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:48,652
Jane!

480
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:51,554
When did you come back?

481
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,026
I’ve missed you.

482
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:57,751
Have you started your new job or are you still on a break?

483
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,759
I take on jobs here and there.

484
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:02,658
I’m working on a commercial right now.

485
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,271
When you want to come back here, just let me know.

486
00:38:05,874 --> 00:38:07,026
You can get any role you want.

487
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:10,754
I’ve missed working with you.

488
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:12,764
You’re not in a rush to leave, are you?

489
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,928
You’re waiting for your internship interview, right?

490
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:10,674
I’m sorry.

491
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:15,698
I’m late because we had a test for the client’s product today.

492
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:20,247
You want to intern as an assistant.

493
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,850
You mean Assistant Director?

494
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:28,919
Yes.

495
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:34,258
Why do you want to intern as an Assistant Director?

496
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:37,031
Well, I want to work on set.

497
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:42,063
Oh, hey.

498
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:46,349
The art team was so good at badminton.

499
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:47,543
They took it very seriously.

500
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:49,746
I’m out of breath.

501
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,572
What are you doing?

502
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,767
Oh, you want to hand in your work?

503
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,468
Remove the picture on the bottom right.

504
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:04,764
Remove this one too.

505
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:38,928
Jo.

506
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:39,652
Hey.

507
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:40,315
Hi.

508
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:41,047
Jane.

509
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:42,475
Wow.

510
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:43,526
How are you?

511
00:40:43,548 --> 00:40:44,647
I’m good.

512
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,178
How’s it going here?

513
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:49,789
I don’t do much each day.

514
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:51,869
All I do is build Lego.

515
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,167
If you enjoy it, just keep doing it.

516
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:57,191
I only discovered what I like to do when I’m old

517
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,515
but it’s better than being old and not knowing what I like.

518
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:02,246
Yes.

519
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:07,160
At least now I know that building Lego before I die will give me peace.

520
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,806
Good for you.

521
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:13,266
How have you been?

522
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:17,276
It’s been five years since you left this home.

523
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:23,356
Well, I’ve been so tired.

524
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:27,484
It’s like I had to start everything by myself

525
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:32,258
but it’s been good.

526
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,748
It’s made me see myself better.

527
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:35,475
Okay.

528
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:39,360
I matter more in my eyes now.

529
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:41,982
I think

530
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:45,938
I’m finally out of your shadow now.

531
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,364
I know what I want.

532
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:51,022
Thank you.

533
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:53,449
Thank you for everything.

534
00:41:55,478 --> 00:42:00,315
I’m glad to see you today.

535
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,663
I’m glad to see you too.

536
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:03,709
Good.

537
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:15,680
Intern?

538
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:17,013
Yes.

539
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:20,266
The people are kind here.

540
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:21,351
There’s nothing to worry about.

541
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:38,542
Hey!

542
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:39,386
Pah!

543
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:42,088
Don’t come any closer!

544
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:43,618
Let me get another mic.

545
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:45,458
Hey!

546
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:48,302
Come back here.

547
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:50,258
No.

548
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,395
No.

549
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,418
Can I get a piggyback ride?

550
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:05,075
Hey, Jane!

551
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:06,151
Where’s Jane?

552
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,924
You’re on top of him, you idiot.

553
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:25,804
Damn.

554
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:27,938
How romantic.

555
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:32,160
He used to be strict as hell.

556
00:43:32,178 --> 00:43:34,764
Why didn’t they fall for each other sooner?

557
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,635
Jane!

558
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:37,031
Over here!

559
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:43,271
Jane, where have you been?

560
00:43:43,648 --> 00:43:45,778
My friend was upset for a year.

561
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:51,662
If you leave him again, I’ll tell him to find someone else.

562
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:53,635
Yeah!

563
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:55,028
Someone more handsome than you.

564
00:43:55,058 --> 00:43:56,068
Yeah!

565
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:57,075
More talented than you.

566
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,151
Yeah!

567
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,462
Don’t leave my friend again, understand?

568
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:01,591
Yeah!

569
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:09,271
Well done, Tae!

570
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:11,680
Jane is scared now.

571
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:37,458
I’m not going anywhere anymore.

572
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:38,960
I’ll stay with you.

573
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:43,884
Will there be someone?

574
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:50,409
Then I found you, the one I looked for all along

575
00:44:52,078 --> 00:44:55,991
Excuse me, excuse me, can you teach me, please?

576
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,938
About love, about love, can you help me with these?

577
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:03,568
If you take me on, I promise I'll study hard

578
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,658
Please teach me the matters of the heart

579
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:16,302
(Ryan After Work)

580
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:17,093
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

581
00:45:17,118 --> 00:45:18,773
(The group is quiet again.)

582
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,844
(We have work to do.)

583
00:45:20,878 --> 00:45:27,164
(Guys, my intern has talent but zero self-confidence. What should I do?)

584
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,493
(Just share how you built your own confidence.)

585
00:45:31,538 --> 00:45:33,108
(You’re right.)

586
00:45:33,138 --> 00:45:39,022
(My intern is so scared of me. I don’t understand why.)

587
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:42,278
(You really don’t know, Pie?)

588
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:46,148
(My intern this year is so talented.)

589
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:50,448
(Mine still makes spelling mistakes!)

590
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,338
(Babe, you need to calm down and teach her patiently.)

591
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,862
(Alright, baby Tae.)

592
00:45:56,898 --> 00:46:00,188
(We’ve come so far. I’m so proud!!!)

593
00:46:01,218 --> 00:46:03,573
(Ryan changed the group name to “Mentors”)

594
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,364
(Okay.)

595
00:46:04,382 --> 00:46:05,191
(Okay.)

596
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:07,653
(Ryan.)

597
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:11,831
(Ryan.)

598
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:13,564
(Yes, Jane?)

599
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,715
(Are you coming yet? I’m waiting in front of your house.)

600
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,555
(What? Where are we going?)

601
00:46:17,591 --> 00:46:20,178
(House hunting, of course.)

602
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,746
(You said you wanted to live with me.)

603
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:25,013
(Don’t you want to live together anymore?)

604
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,358
(I totally forgot we’re going today.)

605
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,178
(Never mind. Just hurry.)

606
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:31,218
(I’ll wait.)

607
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:34,649
(Good. You made me wait for you for so long.)

608
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:36,666
(Can you wait for me for a change?)

609
00:46:36,702 --> 00:46:39,004
(You’re talking back these days.)

610
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,413
(You weren’t like this as an intern.)

611
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,635
(You’re acting like a mentor again.)

612
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:46,204
(Why? You don’t like it?)

613
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,715
(That’s not what I meant.)

614
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,998
(I like every version of you.)

615
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,662
(You crazy kid.)

616
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:56,688
(Just hurry up.)

617
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:58,338
(Okay.)

618
00:46:58,364 --> 00:46:59,884
(Darling.)

619
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:02,409
(Ryan unsent a message.)

620
00:47:02,435 --> 00:47:03,849
(What?)

621
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:05,908
(Darling.)

622
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:08,188
(Okay.)

623
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,588
(Darling.)

624
00:47:10,718 --> 00:47:14,569
(Okay.)

625
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:19,068
Let’s hear some loud cheers and applause for The Trainee.

626
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:22,782
Excuse me, excuse me, can you teach me, please?

627
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,675
About love, about love, can you help me with these?

628
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:30,311
If you take me on, I promise I'll study hard

629
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:34,711
Excuse me, excuse me, please lend me a hand

630
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:38,666
Excuse me, excuse me, please lend me a hand

631
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:42,649
This thing called love, can you help me understand?

632
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:46,044
I want to know what it feels like to be in love

633
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:50,311
Please teach me the matters of the heart
