1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,524
Are you still holding up okay with interning at the same place as me?

2
00:00:03,093 --> 00:00:04,711
Are you tired from working like this?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,471
I am, but it’s fun.

4
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:11,777
Even though you didn’t want to intern here in the first place,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,764
I want you to learn as much as possible.

6
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:18,195
Now I feel silly for following my boyfriend to intern.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,484
It’s great that you love each other.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,973
I have work for you.

9
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,488
Someone Baimon knows wants to make a music video.

10
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:25,795
I’ll send you the song so you can listen to it

11
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,991
and come up with ideas for pitching.

12
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:28,604
Okay.

13
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,293
Excuse me, Jane.

14
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,290
Could you look at my ideas for the MV?

15
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:33,537
If you can only come up with shallow ideas,

16
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:35,875
you might as well sit back and do nothing until it’s time to get off work.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,515
Are you hungry?

18
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:40,510
We can eat at the noodle shop up ahead.

19
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,324
Do you want to go to my room? I’ll get you something to eat.

20
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,275
Hold this.

21
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,880
How are you finding the internship so far? Do you like it?

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,991
I’ve started to. A lot.

23
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,980
Why aren't you wearing a shirt like the one you wore yesterday?

24
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:18,408
I told you that wasn’t my shirt.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,426
Was it your partner’s?

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,862
No.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,791
If not, then someone you’re in a talking stage with?

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,502
Nothing like that.

29
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:32,590
Stop asking. Move.

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,546
Fine.

31
00:01:33,582 --> 00:01:34,213
I’ll stop teasing you.

32
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,093
Is that person your secret crush?

33
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,684
Well, I’m still not sure if I like him.

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,968
Hold on.

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,613
It’s not that you don’t know if he likes you,

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,906
but you don’t know if you like him?

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,595
You can figure it out. It’s easy.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,724
I don’t see anything.

39
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:12,133
Because love has no rules,

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,746
you have to write them yourself.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,444
Whoa, coach.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,755
Come on.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,782
Here’s “7 Check Love”, a checklist to see if you’ve fallen in love.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,613
One, you love looking at him secretly.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,737
Even though he’s doing nothing, you find him interesting.

46
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,240
Anything interesting?

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Is there anything I can help you with?

48
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,955
No.

49
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,946
When you love or like someone, it definitely shows through your actions, Ryan.

50
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,533
Hey.

51
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,973
Who unplugged the fridge?

52
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,982
It’s so dusty

53
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,608
I’ve already coughed many times.

54
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,506
Two, you want to do something nice for him, even though he didn’t ask.

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,462
I think that’s enough.

56
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,542
May I get through?

57
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:57,840
May I get through?

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,906
May I get through? Excuse me.

59
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,151
I’m thirsty too.

60
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,711
Shit, it’s a ghost!

61
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,862
I’m human.

62
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,764
Can you open the door?

63
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,848
Now close it.

64
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,955
I’ll work on the sound effects, and then make the cut.

65
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,817
Absolutely.

66
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:18,604
I’ll bring your concern to the post-production team.

67
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:22,524
Please take a look at the slides and let me know if you have any comments.

68
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:23,964
Feel free to tell me what you don’t like.

69
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,982
Anything?

70
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,373
We take turns sleeping.

71
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,890
I work solo during the late night.

72
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,973
Just keep the camera on.

73
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,248
I want to keep you company.

74
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,520
Don’t forget to wear your retainer.

75
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,222
I’ll wear it soon.

76
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,124
It’s after 2 a.m. now.

77
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,991
You should go to sleep. It’s late.

78
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,866
No.

79
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,182
Hello, Judy.

80
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,044
I’m sorry for calling you so late.

81
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,577
We have to go to Central World early tomorrow.

82
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,106
I’ll send you the details.

83
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,746
Oh, okay.

84
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,137
You sound so sleepy.

85
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:43,130
I’m sorry. Go to sleep.

86
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,880
Good night. I’ll see you tomorrow.

87
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:45,991
Okay.

88
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:57,990
Here’s your food.

89
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,168
Don’t touch me. It’s too hot.

90
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,097
Ryan, you started eating without us.

91
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,457
Are you that hungry?

92
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,946
Write down your order.

93
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,964
Tae, can you write it down for me?

94
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:14,773
I’ll get the usual.

95
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,915
Handsome, here’s your fried pork and garlic with rice.

96
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,191
I made it in advance, seeing you eat this every day.

97
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,142
Three, you pay more attention to him

98
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,386
and think about whatever his favorites are.

99
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:50,648
Here.

100
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,800
This is your provision for tonight.

101
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,088
I’ve prepared them for you.

102
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,200
It’s called…

103
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:56,222
Hey!

104
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,373
It’s called “Your Favorite Snacks from Me”

105
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:03,537
Thank you.

106
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,875
What’s wrong with him?

107
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,466
He’s in love.

108
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,200
But why did he have to run when he’s in love?

109
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,524
What can I get for you?

110
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,084
One of these, please.

111
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,964
Of course.

112
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,444
This is our last one.

113
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,080
Here you go.

114
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,066
Please give it to the girl.

115
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,831
When it’s time to decide on something that involves him…

116
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,386
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

117
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,004
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

118
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,217
All you think about is him.

119
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,924
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

120
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,471
Jane, during my stroll, I found a good snack shop by chance, so I got this for you.

121
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,182
You found it by chance?

122
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,444
Go wash up. We have a meeting soon.

123
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,431
The client is here.

124
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,773
Okay.

125
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,355
According to our research on women these days,

126
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:47,502
their lifestyles are keeping up well with the world,

127
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:54,791
and we believe that Joy Life Collagen can tell a story from their perspectives.

128
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:57,191
Why don’t you let your assistant speak too, Baimon?

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,973
I know you well and I’ve heard from you on many projects.

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,897
I want to hear your team’s attitude now.

131
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,466
Well, I think it’s better to let the director talk

132
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:16,293
because these are his ideas.

133
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,848
It’s okay.

134
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,044
I know his abilities.

135
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,595
I want to know his assistant’s abilities too

136
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,297
so I can feel more comfortable working with you guys.

137
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,320
Okay.

138
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,106
Adding on to what Baimon said, we’ll be focusing on storytelling

139
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,435
to present the brand’s image without being pushy.

140
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,782
The theme will be “Life’s worth comes from loving yourself.”

141
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:53,920
We’ll communicate that through women aged 50-60 who live like normal teenagers

142
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,964
and do all the activities without feeling shy.

143
00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:58,693
You’re?

144
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,177
I’m Jane.

145
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:08,515
What do you think of a woman older than you who’s still pretty and perfect?

146
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:18,684
I think it’s normal to take good care of yourself.

147
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,235
Maybe she uses Joy Life.

148
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,666
Such a sweet talker.

149
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,640
I trained him myself.

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,337
We vibe really well.

151
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:48,586
It should be easier for us to talk with each other.

152
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,075
(Jane is getting hit on.)

153
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,520
(She’s my mom’s age.)

154
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,310
Four, this one is also important.

155
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,724
You’re furious when you see him paying attention to someone else.

156
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,115
These cookies are delicious.

157
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,995
Can you buy more?

158
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,191
Okay.

159
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,413
Thank you so much, everyone.

160
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,902
You’re quite something, Mr. Jane.

161
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:10,826
I’ll see you next time.

162
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,071
Ms. Joy is totally hitting on you, Jane.

163
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,706
Does she like the cookies or you?

164
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,222
You’re quite something, Mr. Jane.

165
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:55,700
But actually, this is not a bad look.

166
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,715
What’s wrong with him?

167
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,960
He’s in love.

168
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,937
That’s why he’s not acting like himself.

169
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,435
What do you think of Ms. Joy?

170
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,160
Can I really say it?

171
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,235
It’s not that bad.

172
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,768
Jane is always the client magnet.

173
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,942
Are you feeling stiff?

174
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,195
A little bit.

175
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,520
Can I help? I know how to massage.

176
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,342
Sure.

177
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,337
I’m feeling stiff around my shoulders.

178
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,440
Right here.

179
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,733
Whoa, they’re so tense.

180
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,062
You should get a massage to relax them sometimes.

181
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,706
Do you want to go with me?

182
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,075
I don’t like getting a massage alone. It’s too quiet.

183
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,266
I feel uncomfortable.

184
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,060
Sure. Let’s go when we have time.

185
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,208
We might not have to go anymore, since you’re so good at massaging.

186
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,524
So, are you excited about working as an AE?

187
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,582
We see different kinds of clients every day.

188
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,213
It seemed like she was trying to eat Jane up

189
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:57,422
but I think he handled it well.

190
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,733
He always managed to steer the conversation back to work.

191
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,417
In the past, Jane would’ve lost it.

192
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,177
He’s gotten so much softer now.

193
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,226
Jane is like a strict class leader

194
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,924
who doesn’t listen to the teachers.

195
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,431
Jane really was a class leader.

196
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,946
We went to the same high school.

197
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,031
Really?

198
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes.

199
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,951
You don’t look like you could be friends.

200
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,515
You guys are so different.

201
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,195
I guess we really are different.

202
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:34,311
Jane was a class leader who’d note down my name when I talked in class.

203
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,666
I got that all the time too.

204
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,422
The one who noted down my name was Tae.

205
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:50,915
We actually have a lot in common.

206
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,880
Except for one thing—I’m not as clingy to a partner as you are.

207
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,213
More like your partner is clingy to you.

208
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,955
You’re so good-looking.

209
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,302
You’re exaggerating.

210
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,640
More importantly, I’m single.

211
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,560
Really?

212
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,475
Mm-hm.

213
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,368
How come a pretty and talented girl like you is single?

214
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:18,542
It’s true.

215
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,982
All I do is work. No one has approached me.

216
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,457
I think people are scared to approach you.

217
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,942
They’re in different leagues.

218
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,551
You’re exaggerating, Ba-Mhee.

219
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,853
You praise me too much.

220
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,964
I’d love to have a partner who’s good at massaging though.

221
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,991
Have you finished your work already?

222
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:48,728
Not yet.

223
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:00,355
Judy, did I note it down correctly?

224
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,253
Hmm.

225
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:08,897
Yes.

226
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,848
Can you stay and help me tonight?
(Ba-Mhee.)
(Dinner tonight? I’m off early today.)

227
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,448
I have to finish up so many other things.

228
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,613
Sure.

229
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,475
It’s done.

230
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,511
Is there anything else you need help with?

231
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,902
No. You can leave.

232
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,697
But…

233
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,893
Damn. He’s like The Flash.

234
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,297
(Are you coming?)

235
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:45,982
Stop.

236
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,875
Don’t sit on that yet.

237
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,551
Is it in here?

238
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,640
Will we find it?

239
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:56,844
The pen?

240
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,377
This is not it.

241
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,786
What is this?

242
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,182
Damn. Who ate this orange and hid it here?

243
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,613
Throw it away.

244
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,595
Can I help?

245
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:11,600
No, it’s okay.

246
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:12,728
Have you found it?

247
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:13,875
The AirPod.

248
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,915
I've been looking for this for a year.

249
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,057
Oh, this is mine.

250
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:25,502
Is this it?

251
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:26,186
Yay!

252
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,180
Thank you.

253
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:29,946
I thought I'd have to buy a new one.

254
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,306
I would have if I were you.

255
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,608
Are you okay?

256
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,657
Yes.

257
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,702
Thank you so much, Tae.

258
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,804
(Are you coming?)

259
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,755
(Oh no, I’m working late tonight.)

260
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,493
(Got it. Rooting for you.)

261
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:13,964
(@Tae Thanat C. This Saturday?)

262
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:16,195
(@Tae Thanat C. Look.)

263
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:19,182
(Let’s go to the beach this long weekend?)

264
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:21,573
(@Tae Thanat C. Wanna go?)

265
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:29,973
Why did you bring so much stuff?

266
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:30,915
Ugh.

267
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:33,528
Hey.

268
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,711
Will there ever be a day when you’re not messy, Pah?

269
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:41,191
The cleaning auntie must be cursing you with all the mess you make.

270
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,235
I worked, not coated myself in flour like tempura.

271
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,911
Working with Baimon today was a lot.

272
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,168
I looked up references and the mood and tone.

273
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,928
I’ll also have to make a presentation deck soon.

274
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,204
What did Jane ask you to do, Ryan?

275
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:19,982
By the way, I don’t know what’s gotten into Tae.

276
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:21,980
Normally, he stays until the office closes.

277
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,120
Your timings just never match.

278
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,413
Come on.

279
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,968
It’s just temporary.

280
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,648
We have a lot of new clients.

281
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,480
True. We have a lot of new clients and also old clients to keep.

282
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,924
Judy takes very good care of the clients.

283
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,920
I didn’t think she’d be great at everything.

284
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:50,782
I started off not wanting to work, but now I’m really tired and enjoying it a lot.

285
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:52,497
It’s like going to school every day.

286
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,500
Judy can speak four languages too.

287
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:57,626
Thai, English,

288
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,768
Did she hire you to praise her?

289
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,191
Right? Since when are you friendly with her?

290
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,813
Let me tell you about my Uncle Moo too.

291
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,186
He recently bought me grass jelly as a treat.

292
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,360
Can you stop talking about the mentors?

293
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,582
Five, if you’re moody and anxious about him,

294
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,675
it means you’re about 60% into him.

295
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,240
Is this what you meant when you said he’s in love?

296
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,631
I think I know who he has feelings for.

297
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,306
That person is not far.

298
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:03,102
Why am I so angry?

299
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,457
When you love or like someone, it definitely shows through your actions, Ryan.

300
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:10,533
Really?

301
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,622
Do I like him?

302
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,946
You’re still thinking about what we talked about the other day, right?

303
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,626
I can tell by the way you’re acting.

304
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:46,115
If I’m reading you right, the one you like is in this office,

305
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:51,884
somewhere around here,

306
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,217
and working in this room.

307
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:57,930
Pie.

308
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,617
You

309
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,760
like

310
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,982
You like Baimon, right?

311
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:25,920
Don’t be shy.

312
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,555
Even though he’s a bit eccentric

313
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,595
if you look carefully,

314
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,084
like really carefully,

315
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,515
he’s quite handsome.

316
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,684
Judy, I’m leaving.

317
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,364
Okay. See you.

318
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,088
Bye.

319
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,880
You can leave without me, Ba-Mhee.

320
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:05,964
You’re in a hurry, right?

321
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,333
I’m not, but…

322
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,617
I need to pee, Judy, and it’s dark.

323
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:24,826
Are you afraid of ghosts?

324
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,346
Don’t say that keyword.

325
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,875
Why are you laughing?

326
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:39,870
I’m afraid of them for real.

327
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,844
I’m not laughing at your fear,

328
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,702
but because I’m afraid of them too.

329
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,560
I’ve been holding it for some time but I'm too afraid to go.

330
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,142
Let’s go?

331
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,173
Huh?

332
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,208
Let’s go to the toilet.

333
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,315
Maybe we can fight what shall not be named.

334
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,075
Go!

335
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:22,595
Shh!

336
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:30,684
Slowly.

337
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,146
What’s that sound?

338
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:48,490
My phone.

339
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,675
That really scared me.

340
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,208
Are you okay?

341
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,551
Are you okay?

342
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:19,804
What? You’re still here.

343
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:21,110
You’ve been sitting there so quietly.

344
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,782
Yeah.

345
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,991
Do you want to eat?

346
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,102
I’m not hungry.

347
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:46,320
Six, if you’ve fallen for him, you’ll become 300% more irrational.

348
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,666
Do you want to go?

349
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:55,733
No.

350
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,577
Let’s go.

351
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,617
Your stomach is growling loudly and I’m about to close the room.

352
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,133
Come on.

353
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:31,840
Here are your noodles.

354
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,871
Thank you.

355
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:46,560
Stop doing that and start eating already.

356
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,666
Ba-Mhee, are you still there?

357
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,222
I’m here.

358
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Don’t be quiet.

359
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,715
Mm-hm.

360
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:29,982
(Still at work? Do you want me to pick you up?)

361
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,968
Do you want to have dinner with me?

362
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:34,951
I know an even better place than the one we went to the other day.

363
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,217
(Do you want to eat at the 24-hour tonkatsu place?)

364
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,760
(My work isn’t done yet. If you’re hungry, go ahead without me.)

365
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,524
Do you want to go?

366
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,484
I know you haven’t had dinner yet.

367
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,493
Let’s go eat together after work.

368
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:04,986
(Okay.)

369
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:47,964
Now that you’re full, tell me why you’re so mad at me today.

370
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,835
Why are you mad at Phi?

371
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:08,640
You didn’t care about my feelings.

372
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,244
Why did you give them to someone else?

373
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,164
What did I do?

374
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,160
Call yourself Phi again.

375
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,520
What did Phi do?

376
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,826
How did I not care about your feelings?

377
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,297
The cookies.

378
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,031
What about the cookies?

379
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,866
If you didn’t want to eat them, you could’ve just given them back to me.

380
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,333
You can have them back if you want.

381
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,180
I’ve only had a few pieces.

382
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,456
Is this the reason you’ve been mad at me all day?

383
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,960
Well, I…

384
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,604
When you don’t know something, just ask.

385
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,213
Don’t jump to conclusions.

386
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,226
You ran to buy this jar of cookies at lunchtime, right?

387
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,142
You know.

388
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,466
Of course. That’s why I didn’t let anyone eat them.

389
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,555
I planned to eat them myself.

390
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,155
The ones Ms. Joy ate were probably Prang’s.

391
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,280
They’ve been in the meeting room for a few days.

392
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,155
Do you feel better now?

393
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,248
Next time, just ask.

394
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,862
I said you can ask me anything.

395
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,266
Are you sure I can ask you anything?

396
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,022
Try me.

397
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,946
Can you call yourself Phi with me forever?

398
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,106
Yeah.

399
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,133
Sure.

400
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:50,542
Here comes the last point on the checklist.

401
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,786
No matter how many people are around you,

402
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,697
your eyes will see only him.

403
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,093
If you check off everything on the list, it means you have feelings for him, Ryan.

404
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,551
Before you worry about your boyfriend disappearing,

405
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:52,222
you should be more concerned about your meatballs.

406
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,790
Pah keeps eyeing them.

407
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,400
Ba-Mhee, I’ll be right back.

408
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,080
I won’t be long.

409
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,231
Why are you mad at Phi?

410
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,386
Can you call yourself Phi with me forever?

411
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,124
Yeah.

412
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,222
Sure.

413
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,626
Ryan.

414
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,182
Have you seen Baimon?

415
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:40,524
No.

416
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,355
Isn’t he in your sight at all?

417
00:37:56,213 --> 00:37:57,013
Damn.

418
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:59,510
Is there anyone normal around here?

419
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:00,000
Me.

420
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,968
Ryan, you’re not going to eat those meatballs, right?

421
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:13,140
And you’re not going to eat these either, right?

422
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,262
Where are my meatballs?

423
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,204
Pah!

424
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,186
Get them out.

425
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,364
That shop makes more yummy brownies than cookies.

426
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,066
You’re not going to eat these brownies either, right?

427
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,302
Hey, I’m still using it.

428
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,320
No.

429
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:30,320
You’re daydreaming and wasting water.

430
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,973
Pie, can you stand still for 10 seconds?

431
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,364
What are you doing?

432
00:40:06,382 --> 00:40:07,920
Let me get a bit closer.

433
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,813
What’s wrong with you?

434
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,631
That didn’t feel the same as when I was with Judy.

435
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,560
Ba-Mhee.

436
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,004
Don’t tell me you like Judy.

437
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,053
Yes, I confirm.

438
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:30,053
Mr. Tae, you’re all set for Saturday at 11 a.m.

439
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:32,160
I’ll send you a confirmation message.

440
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,733
Am I going to die?

441
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:49,850
Do I like Jane?

442
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,266
Do I like Judy?

443
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,964
Who do you like again, Ryan?

444
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,511
(Ryan After Work)

445
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:18,240
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

446
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,333
(This group has been quiet lately.)

447
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,431
(Where are you guys?)

448
00:41:23,475 --> 00:41:25,235
(I’m trying to finish editing at the office.)

449
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,835
(I just got home.)

450
00:41:26,871 --> 00:41:29,840
(@Tae Keep going, babe. I just got home too.)

451
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,968
(I’m stuck in traffic. It’s so boring.)

452
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,960
(True. We’re born to get old, stuck in traffic, and die.)

453
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:40,906
(But nothing is as boring as listening to Joy flirting with Jane during the meeting.)

454
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,311
(555555)

455
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,920
(Ouch. That’s harsh.)

456
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:46,755
(Baimon worked so hard to come up with the ideas but she didn’t care at all.)

457
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:51,217
(Anyway, I just learned that directors have to come up with ideas too.)

458
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:53,537
(Did Baimon come up with the ideas himself?)

459
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,963
(Don’t we normally hire an agency to do that?)

460
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:59,564
(That’s actually right, but if it’s not a very big project,)

461
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:01,920
(like when a product owner like Ms. Joy hires us for production,)

462
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:03,591
(Baimon works on all the ideas himself.)

463
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:05,582
(You sound professional now.)

464
00:42:05,626 --> 00:42:08,888
(Why? Does everyone have to be nonsense like you?)

465
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:11,911
(I’m home now. Don’t fight.)

466
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,591
(Ryan, you haven’t answered my question from the rooftop today.)

467
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:18,915
(It’s nothing. I’m going to continue watching my series.)

468
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:20,631
(I’ve been so obsessed lately.)

469
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,826
(I keep quoting lines from it.)

470
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:25,653
(I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 555555)

471
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,937
(I got to go.)

472
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,377
Urgent work is like this.

473
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:30,391
Do you want to help me?

474
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:32,124
Come stay at the office this weekend.

475
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,217
If you’re worried about him forgetting,

476
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:36,746
just tell him it’s your anniversary this Saturday.

477
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,951
Are you really supposed to remind each other about these things?

478
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,391
Are you drunk already?

479
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:44,684
Well, your client tried to get me drunk again.

480
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:46,960
It’s fun when you sing.

481
00:42:46,986 --> 00:42:47,964
I like it too.

482
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:53,377
Hey, Uncle Moo asked me to get the collagen capsule bottle for the test.

483
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:54,426
It should be this one.

484
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,253
There’s only one.

485
00:42:55,288 --> 00:42:56,657
Where did you get this bottle?

486
00:42:56,684 --> 00:42:58,506
It’s not what we need for the test.

487
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,586
Who took the bottle from my desk?
