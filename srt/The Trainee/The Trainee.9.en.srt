1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,182
Judy.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,680
Hmm?

3
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:03,226
About last night,

4
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,610
I’m sorry.

5
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,610
Ba-Mhee, why are you apologizing to me?

6
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,071
If you want to apologize,

7
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:09,626
you should do it to your boyfriend.

8
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,413
Tae, will you stop being miserable already?

9
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,551
Have you taken a single bite?

10
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:16,248
Stay out of other people’s business.

11
00:00:16,257 --> 00:00:17,306
You’re right.

12
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,737
I’m nosy.

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,084
I happened to be with him when he was crying his eyes out.

14
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:23,031
I happened to see where you went

15
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,204
when he was doing everything for you.

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,097
You know,

17
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,462
your 'soon' felt so long

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,460
for the one who was waiting like me.

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,164
Should we end this?

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,946
I’m sorry.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,106
What’s in that bag?

22
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,351
Check it out.

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,697
Are you going to change your shoes?

24
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:53,690
Do you think I can wear that size?

25
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,690
Whose size is it, really?

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,915
Thank you, Jane.

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,813
Oh, shit!

28
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,128
Sorry.

29
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,044
Sorry.

30
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:13,173
Sorry.

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,284
Are those new?

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,671
Yes.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,186
Let me take you to wash them.

34
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,431
EP 9: THE CHOSEN ONE

35
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:42,826
Pie!

36
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,702
Help me.

37
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,453
I told you not to include VAT.

38
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,711
What amounts do I sum up?

39
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:55,804
Up here?

40
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:59,982
Yes, and once you’re done, check if it matches the total with VAT.

41
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,395
Damn.

42
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,970
Are you too smart or am I too dumb?

43
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,857
Hey! I need your advice.

44
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,755
You’re probably the only one I can talk to about this.

45
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,115
You’re confused about Judy.

46
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:33,031
How do you know?

47
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,137
It’s not hard to guess.

48
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:37,955
You just broke up with Tae last night and called me crying for an hour.

49
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:43,191
Hey, hey, you’re crying again.

50
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,142
Go cry outside and come back when you’re done.

51
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,764
Pie!

52
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:12,311
Let me guess.

53
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,440
You just confessed your feelings to someone.

54
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,622
How do you know?

55
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,800
So what did Baimon say?

56
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,417
I bet he hasn’t given you a clear answer yet.

57
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,693
Try asking him again.

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,373
You can do that.

59
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:33,688
Really?

60
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:55,511
Pie.

61
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,680
Ugh, I’m not drinking this damn coffee anymore.

62
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:01,715
What is it?

63
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:03,875
I need your advice.

64
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:05,386
Um.

65
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:07,724
How do you live without a partner?

66
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,293
Normally.

67
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,662
My lungs are full of oxygen.

68
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,377
I can swing my arms and walk my legs like normal.

69
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:18,088
But if you don’t take care of yourself, who takes care of you?

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,177
Take care of me when?

71
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,257
If you mean when I’m sick, the doctor, of course.

72
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,040
You can cross the street, right?

73
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,040
I’m not colorblind

74
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:29,075
and my feet can step as much as the others.

75
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:32,000
What about peeling shrimp? How do you do it?

76
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,973
If you don’t even know how to peel shrimp, just eat it with the shell.

77
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,657
I’ll wash this for you.

78
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,480
Hey, Fah, please order a spicy salad for me.

79
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,182
I’ll join you later.

80
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:57,528
Okay.

81
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:08,631
It’s almost lunch break and you want me to look at it now?

82
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:10,426
I’d appreciate it.

83
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,168
There better not be any mistakes this time.

84
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,262
I understand that your work can get you dirty

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,155
but should you really be wearing sandals?

86
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:38,951
Many clients visit our office every day.

87
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,817
What will they think of us?

88
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:43,608
Your whole team does the same thing without teaching each other to improve.

89
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,355
It’s more convenient to work in sandals

90
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:54,577
and I don’t see how wearing this outfit is bad for work.

91
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:57,626
Here it is.

92
00:07:57,662 --> 00:08:00,204
You want to know how it’s bad?

93
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,555
I’ve already explained how to calculate the VAT here.

94
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:08,151
I’ve probably gone over it with people from your team more than ten times,

95
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,760
and you still made mistakes.

96
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:11,386
It’s not my job, isn’t it?

97
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,524
I work in art.

98
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,497
If settling the art team’s invoices is not the art team’s job, then whose job is it?

99
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,733
The costume team’s?

100
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,066
You could speak more nicely.

101
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,060
I’m just explaining

102
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,751
so you know settling the invoices is part of your job too.

103
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:35,200
Keep that in mind and don’t act like no one has taught you anything.

104
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,862
I’ll fix it.

105
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,697
She could’ve been nicer about it.

106
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,288
You go first.

107
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,022
You came first.

108
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:14,764
You go ahead.

109
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,768
I need to refill a lot, so please go first.

110
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,968
It’s fine. You go ahead.

111
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,760
I’ll come back later.

112
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,626
Please go ahead.

113
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,360
Tae’s already stepped aside for you,

114
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,982
so refill it.

115
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,577
Don’t get on my nerves.

116
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,915
You must have had another run-in with the accounting auntie,

117
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:48,248
judging by how you look.

118
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,413
Why is it anyone’s problem if I wear sandals?

119
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,071
Do you think wearing expensive shoes makes you look like a good person?

120
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,391
Why does no one care about the disgusting thing you did?

121
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:13,431
Because you dress well?

122
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,813
Yeah, I know I’m in the wrong,

123
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,982
but you’re criticizing me without even knowing how I feel.

124
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,795
Do you know how hard I’ve tried all this time?

125
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,680
Who are you to judge me like this?

126
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,964
Shall we go to the new Japanese restaurant for lunch?

127
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,480
Let’s go.

128
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:54,204
These two were just checking out its reviews the other day.

129
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:54,888
You guys want to join?

130
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,666
Let’s go.

131
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,368
Nine, what brings you here?

132
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:09,102
I have some business to attend to.

133
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:11,333
How are you, Mon? Doing well?

134
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:15,102
As usual.

135
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,066
You’ve been drinking a lot of beer lately.

136
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,484
I saw your tags every other day.

137
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:23,235
Just a bit.

138
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,528
It’s more than just a bit.

139
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,520
It’s his ex.

140
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,328
What is it?

141
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I told you I need your advice.

142
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,102
I sent you a message last night but you didn’t reply,

143
00:11:43,146 --> 00:11:44,648
so I had to come see you in person.

144
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,791
Let’s grab something to eat together.

145
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:47,857
I want to talk with you.

146
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,737
I really have no one else to turn to but you.

147
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,155
Fine.

148
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:15,617
Can you please use the template I just taught you for the MV deck?

149
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,128
I’ll review it when I come back this afternoon.

150
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,191
Alright. Let’s go.

151
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,790
Let’s have dinner instead.

152
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,742
Let’s go.

153
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,186
Come on.

154
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,613
What’s wrong with you?

155
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,795
What we should be concerned about is probably the CG.

156
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,822
We should define the scope of ideas with the director first.

157
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:51,075
Please take care of the production for us.

158
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:51,982
Of course.

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,808
And we can go with this timeline. There’s no problem.

160
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:55,484
Okay.

161
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,075
That’ll be all for today.

162
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,177
Thank you, Ms. Judy.

163
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,520
You’re welcome. Bye.

164
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,417
Judy, I’m sorry.

165
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,391
I didn’t note down the comments towards the end.

166
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,951
It’s alright. If you’re not okay, please take some rest.

167
00:13:13,146 --> 00:13:15,555
It’s okay. Work is work.

168
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:19,573
Work is work, but if you’re not okay, just forget about work.

169
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,973
I’m okay.

170
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,782
You’re under my care.

171
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,964
If you’re not okay, just tell me.

172
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,808
You don’t have to try to act normal when you’re hurting.

173
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,191
You know,

174
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,702
Tae never paid me any attention.

175
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,693
Whenever I got mad at him, I had to get over it myself.

176
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,955
Tae doesn’t know how to make up with people

177
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,915
so I had to tell him I was okay and get over it myself every time.

178
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,906
Hey.

179
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,235
You just got eyelash extensions.

180
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,466
Wiping like that will make your lashes come off.

181
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,173
Come on. No more crying.

182
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,293
You’re strong, Ba-Mhee.

183
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,422
Baimon, tell us about Jane’s ex.

184
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,155
Were they really together?

185
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:21,150
Why do they seem so close?

186
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,150
No way. I don’t want to gossip.

187
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,422
Yes, they were friends before that.

188
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,760
Nine and Jane used to intern here at the same time.

189
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:35,653
Actually, Nine was close with everyone.

190
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,315
Are they getting back together?

191
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,982
You might be right.

192
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,660
He left quite a long time ago.

193
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:45,271
Something must be going on for him to come back to Jane today.

194
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,377
Please excuse me.

195
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,413
Don’t tell others about this.

196
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:01,360
Be careful with the shedding bristles.

197
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,000
Oh, okay.

198
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,720
Remove all of them.

199
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,657
How do I remove the ones that are stuck?

200
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:06,650
Use the brush to wipe them away.

201
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,720
Hi, Uncle Moo.

202
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:23,208
Hi.

203
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:26,764
We received more comments on the product test shoot

204
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,955
for Ms. Joy’s project the other day.

205
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:31,973
Mainly, we need to remove some shots and remake some stuff for reshooting.

206
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,297
Also, regarding the explosion, they said it was only white smoke

207
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,711
so they want to add the product’s CI color.

208
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,320
That’s actually not hard to do but my team is working on other projects now.

209
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,586
I’ll ask Pah to get items from the Ladprao warehouse and work on the changes.

210
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:51,973
Move.

211
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,955
When do you need it?

212
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,608
Today.

213
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,031
If you’re getting back with someone else, then why are you being nice to me?

214
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:21,662
Hmm?

215
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,924
What did you just say to me?

216
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:27,493
Huh?

217
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,168
What are you doing, Pah?

218
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,928
I was painting and it got all over my body.

219
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,320
I have to go get stuff from the warehouse soon.

220
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,955
What are you doing? Are you free?

221
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:39,950
You could say that.

222
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:43,208
I finished my work ages ago but he’s still not back to review it.

223
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,591
Do you want to go for a ride with me?

224
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,524
It won’t take long.

225
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,937
Yeah.

226
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,742
Here’s your helmet.

227
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,702
Hold on tight.

228
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,591
What is it that you want to talk about?

229
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,777
Say it already.

230
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,770
I need to rush back to review some work.

231
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,635
Why so serious?

232
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,515
As you know, I started my own company a while ago.

233
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,488
There’s this commercial ad project that a lot of companies are pitching for.

234
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,502
Do you still want to be a director?

235
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,960
I want you to co-direct it with me.

236
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,791
If we get this job, it’ll look great on our portfolio.

237
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,888
I have a contract with my company.

238
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,057
I’m afraid I can’t take on a side job.

239
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,050
Then be my Assistant Director.

240
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:10,666
Just help me prepare for the pitch.

241
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,346
You don’t need to be fully involved.

242
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,800
It’s hard to find someone new, Jane.

243
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,480
You’re the most in sync with me.

244
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,475
I’m busy with projects at my company.

245
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,244
I can’t commit to helping you.

246
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,457
I’m only asking for a couple of days.

247
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:26,826
Let’s sit down and work on this together.

248
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,115
Please, Jane.

249
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,982
If not you, then no one.

250
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,960
This agency only works on big projects.

251
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:36,737
You can add this to your portfolio.

252
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:49,500
What’s up?

253
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,670
Which hospital are you in? I’m coming right over.

254
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:56,497
I have to go.

255
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,182
How are you feeling?

256
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:06,577
You’re all set.

257
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,475
Thank you.

258
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,582
Let’s go, Pah.

259
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,324
Hey, Jane.

260
00:20:17,982 --> 00:20:19,320
Who allowed you to go out?

261
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,604
I told you to work in the office, didn’t I?

262
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,231
Well,

263
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,644
I got him out.

264
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,542
It doesn’t matter who invited you.

265
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,217
I didn’t order you to go out, so how could you?

266
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,862
I told you to wait in the office.

267
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:38,586
But where have you been for so long?

268
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,466
You told me to wait, but how long was I supposed to wait?

269
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,502
That doesn’t mean you could go out without telling me.

270
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,297
I thought there was nothing else to do.

271
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,155
It’s just a scratch.

272
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,311
It’s nothing serious.

273
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,000
What if it wasn’t just a scratch?

274
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,533
What if it’s something more serious? Then what would I do?

275
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,080
Can you manage to walk to your department?

276
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,955
Yes, I can. I’ll be fine.

277
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,480
Don’t touch it.

278
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,115
Sorry.

279
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,400
I won’t die easily.

280
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,400
I can keep annoying you for a long time.

281
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:05,244
What’s wrong, Ba-Mhee?

282
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,955
I’m sorry.

283
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,786
For what?

284
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,248
Well,

285
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,377
you actually didn’t have to work on it today.

286
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,973
I was just really mad at you so I gave Uncle Moo that deadline.

287
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,364
Honestly, I don’t know how many things I should apologize to you for.

288
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,084
Stay out of other people’s business.

289
00:22:49,253 --> 00:22:50,293
You’re right.

290
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:51,866
I’m nosy.

291
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:53,860
You must have had another run-in with the accounting auntie,

292
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:55,217
judging by how you look.

293
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,200
When I heard your motorbike crashed, I was so sad, Pah.

294
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:05,653
I’m sorry.

295
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:06,666
Calm down.

296
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:09,650
Calm down.

297
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:10,560
Calm down, okay?

298
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,133
Well,

299
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,248
I need to apologize to you too.

300
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,355
What’s up, lover girl?

301
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,715
Why does no one care about the disgusting thing you did?

302
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:28,728
Because you dress well?

303
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:31,573
Do you know how hard I’ve tried all this time?

304
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:34,260
Who are you to judge me like this?

305
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:38,782
I was so mad at you for Tae that I didn’t consider your feelings.

306
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,355
I’m sorry.

307
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,560
Oh, aren’t you overreacting with that crying?

308
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:04,293
I’m not your boyfriend.

309
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,737
I’ve been thinking and realized there’s nothing wrong with wearing sandals.

310
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,782
I get that people might think I’m dirty, but I don’t know what else to wear,

311
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,266
and I know outsiders wouldn’t understand.

312
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:45,493
Actually, I used to think your job was only to order food for the clients.

313
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,968
You idiot.

314
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,040
While I consider Tae my best friend

315
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,902
and care about him a lot,

316
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,075
I don’t know what you’ve been through.

317
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,386
So,

318
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:15,955
whatever makes you feel comfortable, do it.

319
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,688
I don’t know a damn thing.

320
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,964
Stop cursing at yourself.

321
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,217
Leave that for me.

322
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,337
We should maintain the character of the art and AE teams.

323
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,853
I care about you too,

324
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,266
as a non-best friend.

325
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,260
You talk too much.

326
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:48,951
What?

327
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:32,950
I want you to co-direct it with me.

328
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:34,737
If we get this job, it’ll look great on our portfolio.

329
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,266
Do you still want to be a director?

330
00:27:05,697 --> 00:27:07,690
Here you go.

331
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,217
Lean back, rest your head, and close your eyes.

332
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:19,710
How many times have you cried?

333
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,795
Your eyes are swollen like a bee sting.

334
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,142
If it had been a bee, I wouldn’t have cried this hard.

335
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,520
I’ve had to deal with so many things today.

336
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,355
Why don’t you take a couple of days off

337
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,280
and come back to work when you’re ready?

338
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,382
But you’d have no one to help you.

339
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,911
Before you came, I didn’t have anyone to help me either.

340
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,266
So you’re saying I’ve been a burden since I arrived.

341
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:47,626
No.

342
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,462
You’re very talented, Ba-Mhee.

343
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:52,942
You look like Ultraman right now.

344
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,537
Judy.

345
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,231
If I told you

346
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,755
I want to get to know you better,

347
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,893
to talk and spend more time together,

348
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,937
would you be okay with that?

349
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,604
Because I really feel comfortable being around you.

350
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,911
If you’re not okay with that, it’s fine.

351
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,955
I didn’t say I’m not okay with it.

352
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,133
Please.

353
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,040
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Joey.

354
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:57,911
Thank you very much.

355
00:29:57,955 --> 00:30:00,360
Hopefully, we’ll have good news soon.

356
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:01,528
We’ll keep in touch.

357
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:02,426
That’d be great.

358
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:03,271
Okay.

359
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,106
Thank you and have a good day.

360
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:04,660
Thank you.

361
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:05,244
Yeah.

362
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,924
Let’s postpone the client fix until Monday.

363
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,253
Don’t forget to pay OT to the art team

364
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:15,671
as they’ll need to come in and prepare things.

365
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,280
Tell Prang to order food in advance.

366
00:30:19,324 --> 00:30:23,964
I have a feeling Moo will bring his kids this Sunday.

367
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:25,173
Okay.

368
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:26,782
Thank you so much.

369
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:27,964
See you later.

370
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,235
Oh.

371
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,195
I’m so tired today.

372
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,631
Why am I lying down here?

373
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,980
I’m so tired today.

374
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,551
This is the first time I’ve seen you doing the company president job.

375
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,920
You’re quite innocent.

376
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,471
Please don’t hold it against me. I’m from another province.

377
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:03,146
I just said you’re innocent.

378
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:06,071
What does that have to do with your hometown?

379
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,524
Whenever I feel like I lack talent,

380
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,600
I tend to blame it on these things without realizing it.

381
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,742
If I had studied in Bangkok, would I be more talented?

382
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,315
If I was rich, would people be kinder to me?

383
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,760
Would I be looked down on less?

384
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,946
Hey, I’m from Chiang Mai.

385
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,786
I went to a temple school near my house.

386
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,800
Then you went to university in Bangkok?

387
00:31:48,844 --> 00:31:49,955
That’s right,

388
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:51,244
but I didn’t graduate.

389
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,222
I quit and started working with the props team.

390
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:03,173
I interned with the crew on set.

391
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,675
I got scolded a lot

392
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:13,635
but I’d do anything I didn’t know how to do until I learned how to do it.

393
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,311
Hold on.

394
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,128
This is my favorite.

395
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:26,151
This is tapioca balls with pork filling.

396
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:27,013
Can I have some?

397
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,062
Go ahead.

398
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:29,493
Uncle Moo gave it to me.

399
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,973
Wow, I haven’t had this in so long.

400
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:37,333
Do you remember your interview

401
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,906
when Moo asked what you did best?

402
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:47,431
You said you make more delicious canned rambutan than those sold in the malls.

403
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,817
That day, you explained so clearly how to choose rambutan,

404
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:54,810
how to remove its seeds,

405
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,133
how to put it in syrup, and how to make the flesh taste good after being in syrup.

406
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:04,897
But I don’t want to make canned rambutan for a living.

407
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,337
My dream is much more far-fetched than that.

408
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,937
I want to see my name in the end credits of a foreign movie.

409
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,337
I want to make beautiful films like Spielberg.

410
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,133
How is that far-fetched?

411
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,888
Can Spielberg make canned rambutan like you can?

412
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,853
Pah, don’t think that you’re not talented enough.

413
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,871
Don’t let other people’s words define you.

414
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,435
Keep going.

415
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,266
Whether you end up becoming like Spielberg or selling canned rambutan,

416
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:55,840
you’ll do it better.

417
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,417
Alright.

418
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,497
Once you’ve worked on a foreign movie,

419
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:13,582
I’ll buy a ticket to see it in the cinema and wait for your name in the end credits.

420
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,964
Thank you, Jo.

421
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:25,960
You can have more.

422
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,617
Hey.

423
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:35,440
This is my AirPod.

424
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:39,297
I’ve been looking for it for a year. Where did you find it?

425
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,164
I just found it.

426
00:34:41,191 --> 00:34:41,991
Really?

427
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:43,084
Oh.

428
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,973
Moo from the art team came to apologize to me.

429
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:53,626
He said it was his fault for not having time to teach the intern how to settle invoices

430
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,706
and for causing me trouble.

431
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:01,973
I admitted to him that I was rude.

432
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:09,591
I don’t like seeing imperfect work. Any mistakes will cost the company a lot.

433
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,915
I’m sorry for being harsh with you.

434
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,622
I’m sorry, Pah.

435
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,640
I’m sorry, too.

436
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,991
I didn’t speak nicely either.

437
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,142
So, auntie,

438
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:52,888
Hold on.

439
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,773
Can you call me sister instead?

440
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:58,124
Of course.

441
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:02,311
Can you please teach me how to do it right, sister?

442
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,106
Yes.

443
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:19,697
Here.

444
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,262
I got you a latte.

445
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
Why did you go out like that?

446
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,462
I told you my work was done

447
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,502
and I had nothing else to do, so I wanted to go for a ride.

448
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:42,400
Swear you’re not mad at me.

449
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,266
No.

450
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:49,431
You’re not mad, or you’re not brave enough to swear?

451
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,440
I only went out to discuss work, not disappear.

452
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,591
I was going to come back after the discussion.

453
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:12,280
My bag was still in the office.

454
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,111
Next time, if you want to know something, just ask.

455
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:19,315
Don’t make assumptions.

456
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,257
That Nine guy, who is he?

457
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,715
Nine used to intern and work here.

458
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,293
And yes, he was my ex.

459
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,306
But we broke up 5 years ago.

460
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,106
I have no feelings left for him.

461
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,755
Are you serious?

462
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,351
Of course.

463
00:39:01,813 --> 00:39:03,350
Have I ever lied to you?

464
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,120
How do you feel about me?

465
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,946
Do you have any feelings for me?

466
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,102
Do I look like I don’t have feelings for you?

467
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,040
I don’t hug anyone I don’t have feelings for.

468
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:44,000
What kind of feelings do you have for me?

469
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,857
Behave yourself and I’ll tell you.

470
00:40:49,893 --> 00:40:53,751
Please teach me the matters of the heart

471
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,573
(Ryan After Work)

472
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:11,960
(5 Interns, Class of 24)
(Tae, are you okay?)

473
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,368
(Guys, I have a question.)

474
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:18,240
(Ask away. I’m happy to answer.)

475
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,973
(So the group isn’t quiet.)

476
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,970
(Great.)

477
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:25,031
(Today, when we showed the first draft of the hero project,)

478
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,271
(the client said they didn’t like the wall color)

479
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,751
(because it clashed with their lucky color or something.)

480
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:31,750
(Baimon was okay with the comment though.)

481
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:33,875
(He said he’d ask the post-production team to fix it.)

482
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:37,022
(That’s what I don’t get. Don’t we have to reshoot it?)

483
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:39,020
(How can we fix it?)

484
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:43,004
(Oh, I can’t answer that.)

485
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,924
(We can fix it in the post-production stage. No need to reshoot.)

486
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,604
(Can we really do that?)

487
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,920
(Of course.)

488
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:53,813
(CG isn’t just about special graphics.)

489
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:57,182
(It can fix problems from the shoot too.)

490
00:41:57,226 --> 00:42:00,844
(Or, as you mentioned, if the client doesn’t like the wall color,)

491
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,315
(we can just adjust it to match their brief.)

492
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:07,973
(The better we do it, the better our credit without going over budget.)

493
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,435
(Let me send you an example. There’s a series a senior showed me.)

494
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,320
(When there are issues with little details like these,)

495
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:20,231
(we don’t have to spend more to reshoot.)

496
00:42:20,702 --> 00:42:24,817
(You’ll often hear that things can be fixed in post-production.)

497
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,426
(That gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. LOL.)

498
00:42:30,462 --> 00:42:34,986
(Wow. That’s amazing. Some things looked like they couldn't be fixed.)

499
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:37,715
(Post-production is the MVP.)

500
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:39,475
(For real.)

501
00:42:39,511 --> 00:42:42,142
(It’s every team’s effort.)

502
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:44,284
(It’s tough on the production side too.)

503
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,973
(Even…)

504
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,000
(AE’s job is tough.)

505
00:42:50,044 --> 00:42:52,106
(Sigh.)

506
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,902
(@tae wanna go skydiving? I’ll be your support.)

507
00:42:55,946 --> 00:43:00,488
(Yes, but you can only use one arm now. How are you going to manage?)

508
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:02,684
(I’ll be fine.)

509
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:07,804
(Ba-Mhee, what brand is that velvet tint you told me about?)

510
00:43:07,848 --> 00:43:09,697
(I’ll DM you.)

511
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:10,808
(Okay.)

512
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:11,964
((Awkward) smile)

513
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,822
Tae, what are you doing here?

514
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,164
He’s heartbroken.

515
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,160
How can you move on when you keep doing this?

516
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,737
I still miss her.

517
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:20,097
Win her back. Just try.

518
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,973
I don’t think she’s waiting for me anymore.

519
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:23,262
Have you tried?

520
00:43:25,048 --> 00:43:26,142
Hello?

521
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,240
Who’s here, Dad?

522
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:29,857
A senior from your office came to get his photos taken.

523
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:31,057
Go help him with his clothes.

524
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,915
How did you get here?

525
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,102
Move a bit closer to Ryan.

526
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:37,100
Now I know who you have feelings for.
