1
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,591
Hello.

2
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,768
Please introduce yourself.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,288
Hello. My name is Ryan.

4
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,542
I’m 21 years old.

5
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:21,937
I’m a third-year economics student.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,391
What’s your objective for interning here?

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,377
This company is stable

8
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,777
and important to many private organizations.

9
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:36,280
I think this company will give me experience.

10
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:45,422
I have a dream to improve this country.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,595
I want to use this pair of hands to make changes.

12
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:51,626
The bright future is waiting for me to design.

13
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:01,810
The seniors in my faculty said I’ll get paid for interning here.

14
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:02,462
Let’s try again.

15
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,724
I think this company will give me exp…

16
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,608
I will get the exp…

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,560
This company is near my house.

18
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:13,973
Think of a new answer.

19
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:15,804
How do you expect to get an internship like this?

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
(I don’t know if adults want a cool answer from me)

21
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,391
(or if they want some grander answer.)

22
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,755
(The basic answer about getting an internship is to gain experience.)

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,364
(But I don’t know yet how I’m going to use that experience.)

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,355
(What’s the objective of an internship?)

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,946
(I don’t even know what I want to do in the future.)

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,915
(I don’t even have an answer to this simple question I get asked all the time: the story behind my name.)

27
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:03,617
(I can’t even answer that.)

28
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,075
Hello, this is Nong Ink’s Printing.

29
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:14,826
Hey, this is Bungkee.

30
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,711
I ordered stickers for my cream jars.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,210
Yes.

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,777
(Sunshine by Bungkee)

33
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,502
Did you not understand the brief?

34
00:02:25,537 --> 00:02:26,933
I sell underarm cream.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,413
If the underarm in the picture doesn’t look bright, who’s going to buy it?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,671
You need to look up a lot of references.

37
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:35,297
I’ve already told you my objective.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,968
Fix it. That’ll be all.

39
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:37,670
I’ll take care of it.

40
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,480
Dad.

41
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,688
What’s up?

42
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,200
Where’s the ink for the small printer?

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,604
I asked Ink to order it.

44
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,680
I’m not sure if she has yet.

45
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,328
Oh, bring me a ream of A4 paper.

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,053
Have you ordered the ink?

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,217
What ink now?

48
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,666
For the small printer.

49
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:11,937
I want to print my work and test the colors.

50
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:12,968
I’ve already ordered it.

51
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:14,062
Find the parcel box on the table.

52
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:14,631
Okay.

53
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,822
Wait, An.

54
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:17,182
Bring the camera battery to Dad.

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,142
Dad, I’ll put the battery on the dining table.

56
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:25,777
Yeah, leave it there.

57
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,466
Did you pass your job interview?

58
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,377
I don’t think so.

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,222
Their questions were like a final exam.

60
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,426
What about you?

61
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,973
Have you secured an internship?

62
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,173
All the places are closing their applications soon.

63
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,280
Have you even applied anywhere?

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,551
Please be more proactive about your future.

65
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,275
I don’t even know my future.

66
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,973
What do you want me to be proactive about?

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Answer this easy question. What do you enjoy doing?

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,200
Whoa.

69
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,346
Is that an armpit or a spotlight?

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Come on.

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,320
What do you enjoy doing?

72
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,142
Tell me what you really enjoy doing,

73
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:17,973
not what your dad and your big sister want you to do.

74
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,964
Well, I like watching movies, YouTube, and creating artwork for the clients.

75
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:27,262
I don’t know.

76
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,373
What are you doing tomorrow?

77
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,066
Are you free?

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Come to the internship interview with me.

79
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,368
I ordered a new fish tank.

80
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,506
I need to pick it up from the store.

81
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,986
Come with me first, then I’ll help you later.

82
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:40,133
Just come for fun.

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,448
You might see something new that makes your objective become clearer.

84
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,964
What’s with the “objective” all day?

85
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,150
Just come.

86
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,573
You can’t carry the tank alone.

87
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,502
Come with me first, then I’ll help you with it.

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,897
Please come.

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,431
EP 1: RYAN, THE INTERN

90
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,488
You said this internship place is not far.

91
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:30,293
This is really far.

92
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,528
Why don’t you intern at the other agency then, Ba-Mhee?

93
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:34,560
The one that called you.

94
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,471
How can I do that?

95
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,640
I want to be with you.

96
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,320
Wherever you intern, I’ll intern there.

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,306
But isn’t this too far, Tae?

98
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,413
I can’t wake up this early every day.

99
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:46,142
A little bit.

100
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:58,000
Honestly, I’m used to hard work.

101
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:01,644
Believe it or not, I once filmed at my faculty’s studio until 7 a.m.

102
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,706
I was the only one handling the props.

103
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:04,471
I loved that.

104
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:05,173
You’re hardworking.

105
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:05,768
Yes.

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,208
I did my best.

107
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,222
Have you seen my portfolio?

108
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:11,955
He talks too much.

109
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:16,115
Hey, why did you apply to this place?

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,271
What’s it called? A house?

111
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,013
Yes. A production house.

112
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,760
They’re like a vendor of agencies.

113
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,493
I want to give it a try because I’ve seen Film major students working on set.

114
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:30,426
It seems fun.

115
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,893
Which faculty does a film major belong to?

116
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,804
My faculty.

117
00:07:35,857 --> 00:07:37,368
But I study advertising.

118
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,560
Film students focus on production.

119
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,542
Movie filming.

120
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,568
Hello?

121
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,893
Okay.

122
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,511
Jirayu and Benyapa, which ones are you?

123
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,062
Okay. Please go to the second floor.

124
00:07:58,097 --> 00:07:58,622
Please, guys.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,160
I’ll be right back, babe.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,222
Just hurry.

127
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:05,297
They’re waiting.

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,524
You can do it.

129
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,226
Was that your girlfriend?

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,640
Oh.

131
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,737
Are you together too?

132
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,466
Alright.

133
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,355
Tanat, where are you?

134
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,315
You’re Tanat, right?

135
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,386
Okay. Please go to the third floor.

136
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,208
There’s a sign in front of the room that says “Editing Room”.

137
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,408
Thank you.

138
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,724
Oh, okay.

139
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,275
Pramote?

140
00:08:54,302 --> 00:08:55,564
That’s me. I’m Pramote Boonkerd.

141
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,648
Pramote, come here.

142
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:57,608
Please walk straight.

143
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:01,502
Do you see that green wall over there?

144
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:03,413
Walk through the door.

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,484
Once you get through the door, turn left.

146
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,311
After you turn left, keep straight a little further and you’ll see a container.

147
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,386
Look to your right for the Art Department.

148
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,662
Okay. Got it.

149
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:14,275
Good luck.

150
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,937
How do I go there again?

151
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,930
Go through the green door.

152
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:18,631
Go through it?

153
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:19,448
Okay.

154
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,591
Why don’t you follow me?

155
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,444
The three of you please wait a moment.

156
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,195
This way.

157
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,004
Okay.

158
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,657
Hello, Dad.

159
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:43,964
Why are you calling me?

160
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,462
Dad, I told you I’m going to follow my dream.

161
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,324
I’m not going to England, Dad.

162
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,820
I want to choose my own path.

163
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,417
Did you send someone to follow me?

164
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,195
Don’t think I’m not onto you, Dad.

165
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,666
What?

166
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,208
You’re forcing me to marry?

167
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,413
What you’re doing is not right.

168
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:23,955
Dad, you’re taking away human rights.

169
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,542
Fine, I’ll go home.

170
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,220
Damn it. That’s the wrong way.

171
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:51,540
Are you two interviewing for the Assistant Director role?

172
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,422
Come. They’re waiting for you.

173
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:54,133
This way.

174
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,130
Come on. Get up.

175
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,377
They’re waiting for you.

176
00:10:59,395 --> 00:10:59,982
Well,

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,782
Come on. Get up now.

178
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:01,555
I…

179
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:02,613
They have a meeting after this.

180
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,462
Come on. Get up.

181
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,964
I’m in a hurry. Come on.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,755
You don’t want to be late.

183
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,933
I’m in a real hurry. Come on.

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,733
This way.

185
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:10,168
Go.

186
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:10,942
Go now.

187
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,640
They have a meeting later.

188
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:12,960
Go.

189
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:15,430
(Internship Application)

190
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:21,582
Well,

191
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:31,431
Let me interview both of you at the same time

192
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,760
because if we were to accept you, we’d accept you both.

193
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:37,066
I want to see if you have the chemistry to work together.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,928
My name is Mon or you can call me Baimon.

195
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,697
I’m a Director at this production house

196
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:43,690
and this is Jane, my Assistant Director.

197
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,195
Pay respect to the Buddha, dear, not me.

198
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,395
Well,

199
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,320
Easy.

200
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,644
Let’s interview you one by one instead.

201
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:50,640
Ladies first.

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,680
I love how the younger generation is so passionate these days.

203
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:54,693
Go ahead.

204
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,506
My name is Gulasatree.

205
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,422
My nickname is Pie.

206
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,648
I go to the Faculty of Communication Arts.

207
00:11:58,675 --> 00:11:59,480
Film major. Third year.

208
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,600
I’m applying to intern as an Assistant Director

209
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:03,084
but I actually want to be a director.

210
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:05,502
You can see some of my work in the portfolio I submitted.

211
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:07,955
As for my entries for the contests, I’ve uploaded them to the drive.

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,862
You’ve won a lot of Short Film awards.

213
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,120
I love taking short film courses during my school holidays

214
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,675
so I’ve had real experience a lot of times.

215
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,426
Turn to the later pages.

216
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,688
My certificates are in the back.

217
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,235
They’re from the courses in Japan.

218
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,364
Normally, what’s your workflow?

219
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,622
I work with my regular team.

220
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,391
When we get a brief, we brainstorm ideas

221
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,466
and see which one best aligns with the objective.

222
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,973
Not objective again.

223
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,262
The most recent work in the drive is currently in the contest.

224
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,728
Oh, it already made it to the final round.

225
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,284
Where did you submit this one with the mascot for the contest?

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,697
Thailand or abroad?

227
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:44,728
Thailand.

228
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,537
Akaradech, isn’t it?

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,773
Do you want to start now?

230
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,946
Your name Akaradech is so cool.

231
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,808
But…

232
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,306
You don’t look like your photo.

233
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,755
Did you edit your photo?

234
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,373
Well, that’s not my resume.

235
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,226
The thing is…

236
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:11,973
Come on!

237
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,328
You grabbed the wrong resume again!

238
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,680
That day, my head was in a blur. I couldn’t remember who I picked.

239
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:18,791
Okay. What’s your name?

240
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:21,004
I’ll ask HR to get your resume.

241
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,946
Well,

242
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:22,880
Hello?

243
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,622
You got me the wrong resume again.

244
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:25,573
What’s your name?

245
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,570
My name is Ryan.

246
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,662
His name is Lion.

247
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:30,666
It’s Ryan.

248
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:31,315
What?

249
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:32,142
It’s Ryan.

250
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,102
His name is Lion.

251
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:33,795
It’s Ryan.

252
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,746
An? Sorry.

253
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,297
Well,

254
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,257
Ry-what?

255
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:37,022
Ryan.

256
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,662
Ryan.

257
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:38,835
Sorry. Ryan.

258
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:39,582
Did you find it?

259
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,786
No, his name is not Ryit.

260
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,200
Who on earth has such a name?

261
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:44,311
His name is Ryan.

262
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,817
I said his name is Ryan and asked if you found his resume.

263
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,888
He wants to intern as a PM, not an AD.

264
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:49,840
Wrong. Let me say it again.

265
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:52,702
He doesn’t want to intern as a PM. He wants to intern as an AD.

266
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:53,866
You’re confusing me.

267
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,977
It’s okay. Can you look for it?

268
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:55,970
But it’s okay if you can’t find it. Thank you so much.

269
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,050
Thank you so much.

270
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,835
Forget all that.

271
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:00,097
Introduce yourself again.

272
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:00,915
What’s your name?

273
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,240
My name is Ryan.

274
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,271
Uh…

275
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,400
Ryan?

276
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,520
Are you a foreigner?

277
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,857
Do you have a nickname?

278
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,546
It’s Ryan.

279
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,622
Give me a short nickname.

280
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,973
Choose either Ry or An.

281
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,853
It’s Ryan.

282
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,960
How is that short?

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,111
Were you named after a footballer Ryan Giggs?

284
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,120
Or perhaps an actor. Ryan Gosling?

285
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:34,506
Ryan Reynolds?

286
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,453
Ryan MicModNee?

287
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,982
You were named after a singer.

288
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:38,817
Ryan…

289
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,906
You study economics.

290
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Do you have any experience in production?

291
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,355
Listen. I want to reach a target of 3,000 jars in the first week.

292
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,684
Fix how the underarm picture looks because I need that to run ads.

293
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,546
I’ve worked with ads before.

294
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:04,746
At an agency?

295
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,960
Well, it’s my family business.

296
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,177
Wow.

297
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,217
Do you provide marketing or end-to-end services?

(Nong Ink’s Printing)

299
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,275
Look up a bit.

300
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,213
Everything.

301
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,880
Why do you want to work here when your family has a big agency business?

302
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:30,213
Do you like production?

303
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,204
Film students focus on production.

304
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:35,466
Movie filming.

305
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,484
I love watching movies.

306
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,448
Awesome.

307
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,177
Is there anything else you enjoy besides watching movies?

308
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:51,555
Taking care of my pet fish.

309
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,928
Besides movies, I love watching fish.

310
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:54,755
You’re indie.

311
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,760
You’re indie.

312
00:15:57,813 --> 00:16:00,311
For movies, you’re into something hard to understand, right?

313
00:16:00,312 --> 00:16:02,328
(Skipping ads)

314
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,964
It’s hard to understand why you won’t get a streaming subscription.

315
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,582
You go through such a struggle before you can watch something.

316
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,168
Well, kind of.

317
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:19,822
I really love passionate people.

318
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:25,271
Even though they don’t study in the exact field, they find their way to pursue the job they love.

319
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,506
Oh, I’m impressed.

320
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
Do you have a favorite director?

321
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,600
It could be from movies or advertising.

322
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,155
Well,

323
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,955
Jo!

324
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,408
Why do you have to fix it now?

325
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,151
I’m talking to the interns.

326
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,462
Oh, why do you keep asking him questions?

327
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:55,600
I think he’s tired of answering them already, Mon.

328
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:56,586
Interview him yourself then.

329
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:57,777
Go ahead.

330
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:00,213
Oh, you’re making me do your job again.

331
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,866
What’s your objective?

332
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,946
Objective again?

333
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,120
Hmm?

334
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,342
I want to be like that.

335
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,893
Like that picture.

336
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,631
You want to be porridge with side dishes?

337
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,888
This gives me goosebumps.

338
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,964
Jo, he wants to be porridge with side dishes.

339
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,080
Something plain and bland

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,568
but goes well with anything.

341
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,520

00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,982
not work on set like them

345
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
but he completely misinterpreted it.

346
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,097
Suddenly, my friend’s objective became porridge with side dishes.

347
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,000
It’s funny.

348
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,413
I sat there so sheepishly before I could leave.

349
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,702
Come on. I’ll treat you to Moo Krata today.

350
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,302
Let’s celebrate my getting an internship.

351
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,675
Is it the first place I went with you in the tall building?

352
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:33,911
Yes, that’s the one.

353
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:36,231
I’m getting paid, that’s why I chose that place.

354
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,657
The other place that we went for the interview together also called me,

355
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,700
but I declined.

356
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,786
Did they call you too?

357
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,168
I highly doubt they would call someone who posed as Akaradech

358
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,177
and wanted to be porridge with side dishes.

359
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:51,351
Who knows?

360
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,973
They let you fill out the application form, didn’t they?

361
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,577
The results are being announced in stages today.

362
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:57,973
They might call you.

364
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,226
Yes.

(Should I go home now? I feel like I don’t belong here.)

370
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,342
(If you leave, it’s too late to find another internship.)

371
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:13,500
(You’ll have to deal with earning the credits next semester.)

372
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,084
(Just give it a try.)

373
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,911
My name is Pah. What about you guys?

374
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,560
My name is Tae.

375
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,906
This is my girlfriend, Ba-Mhee.

376
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,222
Babe, why are you talking to him?

377
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:41,706
He asked.

378
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,155
Oh, I remember her.

379
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,413
She’s Gulasatree. That’s what they called her on the interview day.

380
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,955
And you, university student? What’s your name?

381
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:55,200
Ryan.

382
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:58,640
Are you a foreigner?

383
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,631
Uh…English?

384
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,715
England?

385
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,306
Uh…

386
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,177
No.

387
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,546
I’m Thai.

388
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,946
If you’re not a foreigner, how come your name is Ryan?

389
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,973
Your name means noodles. Is that your family business?

390
00:21:10,008 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes, my family has been selling noodles since my great-grandfather’s time.

391
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:13,644
Surprisingly, I guessed right.

392
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:15,493
Is your mother mixed?

393
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,253
No, you must be mixed.

394
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,577
Is your mother a foreigner?

395
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,391
Why were you named Ryan?

396
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:21,813
Ryan?

397
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:22,853
Is your mother a foreigner?

398
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:25,173
AD interns, follow me.

399
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:27,324
Or were you named after your parents’ favorite actor?

400
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,897
Your name is actually cool.

401
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:31,031
That must be the reason because you’re not a foreigner.

402
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:31,706
Hey.

403
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,328
Tae.

404
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:37,191
Yes?

405
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,728
Follow me to the editing room.

406
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:39,937
Sure.

407
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:40,942
Come on, please.

408
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:42,940
I got to go.

409
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:51,911
This is Judy from good pick.

410
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,275
I didn’t get to see you when I visited the other day.

411
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,808
What a bummer.

412
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,337
What’s your intern role, university student Ryan?

413
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,653
Assistant Director.

414
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:12,764
Assistant Director?

415
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,524
Good.

416
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,520
You know, we only have one camera at my faculty.

417
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,928
Everyone in the major has to take turns using it.

418
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:21,102
Seeing a big production house like this makes me so excited.

419
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,915
Hey, Pah!

420
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,004
Hi, Uncle Moo.

421
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,506
Follow me.

422
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,168
I’m off.

423
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:33,760
Can I help?

424
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,822
It’s full of dirt here.

425
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,968
Sorry for making you do this since your first day.

426
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,773
It's chaos at the warehouse.

427
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,240
That’s why I came looking like this.

428
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:51,626
Why didn’t you send someone else who’s not a mess to get me?

429
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,620
I’m the cleanest of them.

430
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,728
Here are the abrasive papers.

431
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,866
Do you think you’re up for it?

432
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,964
You can still change your mind.

433
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,231
Give me the brushes, Uncle Moo.

434
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,520
I’m ready for my internship.

435
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,075
Absolutely.

436
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:29,920
You’re okay with the details I sent you, right?

437
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,702
If so, I’ll send you the quotation.

438
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,502
Sure.

439
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,466
Okay.

440
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,404
I’ll send it soon.

441
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:40,853
Okay.

442
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,013
We met on the interview day.

443
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,973
Today, you can read about the past pitches to understand how our office operates.

444
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,346
Isn’t pitching a job for creatives?

445
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,340
An AE should know everything about the client side

446
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:10,231
and every department within our crew.

447
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,768
(There are only old aunties in my department.)

448
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:22,933
(So boring.)

449
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:25,800
I don’t have much to assign to you today.

450
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,617
You can just familiarize yourself with our past projects to get an idea.

451
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,968
We’re a chill group of people.

452
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,337
Here’s your badge.

453
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,951
And this is our team.

454
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,964
There’s no way we can finish everything on this schedule.

455
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,453
We have to cut something.

456
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,164
Then let’s cut this.

457
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:00,426
I have an idea.

458
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,551
I’ll have Jao help you.

459
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:05,155
I’ll film the pilot and finish the editing myself.

460
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:06,248
I think I can do it.

461
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:07,484
By yourself?

462
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:09,480
Will you be able to make the deadline?

463
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,933
I can help.

464
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,875
Yes, let the interns help.

465
00:25:19,902 --> 00:25:21,955
We haven’t assigned anything to them anyway.

466
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:24,151
This one is a contest enthusiast.

467
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,982
The other one has experience on the agency side but he has so much passion.

468
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,151
Wait, where’s the other one?

469
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,004
Hey.

470
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,168
Where have you been for an hour?

471
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,582
Why are you sitting here doing nothing?

472
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,786
Are you just going to keep waiting if no one comes for you?

473
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:14,897
Hey, can you go get the other three interns?

474
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:15,795
(Pie)

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,862
If you don’t want to intern, feel free to go home instead of wasting time here.

476
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,351
I want to intern.

477
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,902
Then why didn’t you follow Prang when she came to get AD interns?

478
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,097
AD?

479
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,311
AD stands for Assistant Director.

480
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,222
Someone who assists the director.

481
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,155
If you still want to intern, you better get started.

482
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,610
(Ryan)

483
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,120
We need to send the pilot to the client by 6 p.m. today.

484
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:52,693
The storyboard has 15 shots.

485
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,262
Mon wants all the interns to help me film this pilot.
(A pilot is a sample clip created to align the client's vision.)

486
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:00,604
However, I’ll have you guys film only one shot, but using specific techniques.

487
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,377
Can you keep up?

488
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:08,711
(A pilot is a sample clip created to align the client's vision.)

489
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,484
I want a shot of someone’s hand flipping a pan.

490
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:15,493
You can put anything inside but they must be dark green and red.

491
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,520
Let’s do high speed, 120 frames per second.

492
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:23,644
This shot should represent a mother cooking for her child every day.

493
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:28,640
The objective is to make the audience worry about their mothers getting hurt,

494
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,240
prompting them to buy insurance for her.

495
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,257
Can you keep up?

496
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,850
The art team has already prepared the props.

497
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:37,688
That’s it.

498
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,151
What are you guys looking at?

499
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,226
Let’s get started.

500
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:06,773
I’ll handle the props.

501
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,982
What do you guys want to do?

502
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:08,871
I’ll direct.

503
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,706
I’ll shoot.

504
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:14,924
I…

505
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,697
I’ll check the brief.

506
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,102
This is an ad, right?

507
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,040
I read pitches earlier.
(Pitching: Presenting work or ideas to the client)

508
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,160
Okay.

509
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,226
University student Ryan, you’ll flip the pan then.

510
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,813
Come on.

511
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,755
Who received the brief? Let me read it to understand this project

512
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:42,168
so we can quickly finish filming and leave.

513
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:42,906
I did.

514
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,475
How about you raise it?

515
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,470
I’ll throw the bell peppers in so they’ll bounce.

516
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:14,693
The pan is heavy.

517
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,826
Can we change it to a mother making porridge instead?

518
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,955
Hey, don’t go off topic.

519
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,657
You should come up with a way to make the things in the pan bounce.

520
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:26,960
I don’t know how to do that.

521
00:29:26,995 --> 00:29:28,320
If I did, I’d have told you already.

522
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,515
This is not a time to argue.

523
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,920
Let’s quickly get this done.

524
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:35,244
It’s not focusing. Twist it in.

525
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,688
Sorry. I have bad eyesight.

526
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:41,431
Ryan, don’t hold it too tightly.

527
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,208
It looks tense when you do that.

528
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:46,968
The client wants you to look relaxed like you’ve been doing this for 10 years.

529
00:29:47,004 --> 00:29:48,960
But he’s only been doing this for an hour.

530
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,355
How can he relax?

531
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,693
Then help us brainstorm.

532
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,848
Ryan, don’t hold it too tightly.

533
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:56,497
Come on.

534
00:29:59,048 --> 00:29:59,706
Ugh!

535
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:01,964
I’m going crazy.

536
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,804
It’s focusing now.

537
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Come get these dishes out to serve.

538
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,208
Hi. Today Mommy Pen is going to teach you how to flip a pan without burning the vegetables.

539
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:16,462
Let’s get started.

540
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,244
See? I told you you need to lift it and pull it down toward yourself.

541
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,222
Maybe our stove and hers are different.

542
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:23,795
It’s not about the stove.

543
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,093
How about we use a trick?

544
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:28,417
Throw the props in the air and shoot from a low angle.

545
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,804
No.

546
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,955
No matter how low the angle, the pan will still be visible.

547
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:29,386
Get ready to bring this to the customers.

548
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,346
Would you like to order anything else?

549
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,466
It looks okay. I’ll try to edit it.

550
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:48,177
Okay.

551
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:50,657
I’ll leave the footage in your room.

552
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:51,386
Okay.

553
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,804
Have you finished filming?

554
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,053
Not yet.

555
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,573
What?

556
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:02,115
It’s already 1 p.m. What have you guys been doing?

557
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,177
If you haven’t started, don’t bother.

558
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,275
Also,

559
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,928
if you’re interning just for fun, staying until the end of the day would already be an achievement.

560
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,164
You don’t have to tire yourself out.

561
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,671
Did he come to check on us?

562
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,182
I brought a professional.

563
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,480
We’ll survive, Lion.

564
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,124
Get her to her mark.

565
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:27,200
This way please, Auntie.

566
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,444
Make sure it focuses this time.

567
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,204
I think she’s been asked to do this a lot.

568
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,115
Right? She seems tech-savvy.

569
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,035
She wears a smartwatch.

570
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:57,546
My mom doesn’t even wear one.

571
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,568
Shit.

572
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,960
Which hand did she hold the pan with? Right hand, right?

573
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,533
Her watch wasn’t captured, was it?

574
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:10,648
Why don’t you just scroll to her wrist?

575
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,115
I am scrolling! Can you not rush me?

576
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,471
Can’t she wear a watch?

577
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,915
She shouldn’t.

578
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,524
It doesn’t fit the motherly look.

579
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:21,955
It won’t look heartwarming.

580
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:23,182
It may not be what the client is looking for.

581
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,831
The heartwarming mother who makes her children worry when she cooks?

582
00:33:25,866 --> 00:33:27,315
She wears such a high-tech smartwatch.

583
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:28,977
There’s nothing to worry about.

584
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:31,653
My dad wears one too and I worry about him.

585
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,604
Okay. Look at the footage.

586
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,115
Are you worried about her?

587
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,822
You seem like you need more attention than she does right now.

588
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,035
What do we do?

589
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
Don’t tell me we need to reshoot it.

590
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,582
You know how hard it is to get the camera to focus.

591
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:13,173
Aren’t you going to tell the interns that you’re done with filming?

592
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,595
They’re still filming.

593
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:18,328
Let them do it.

594
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,140
Try using that footage for slow motion.

595
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,622
Let’s hand this in. It’s almost 6 p.m. now.

596
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,542
Babe, save it. Let’s go with this one.

597
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:09,573
Okay.

598
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,653
Here you go, Jane.

599
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:54,720
This is the footage the five of us filmed today.

600
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:55,457
There’s no need.

601
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:58,657
It’s late. Just go home.

602
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:00,650
Thank you.

603
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,426
Thank you.

604
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,475
Bye.

605
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,191
Let’s go. Walk quickly.

606
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,226
My arm hurts so bad.

607
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,248
I might want to open a restaurant and become the auntie’s competitor.

608
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,777
I’m a pro now.

609
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,204
More like Tae is a great editor.

610
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,160
No.

611
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,590
It’s all thanks to the director for selecting the footage.

612
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,217
What do you want to be? A director?

613
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,711
You’ll have to wake up early.

614
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,510
Like how you wake up to curl your hair.

615
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,657
When you become a famous director, don’t forget us.

616
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,328
And what’s your dream job?

617
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,928
Nothing.

618
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,857
I want to be Tae’s girlfriend.

619
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,040
That’s it.

620
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,040
Right.

621
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:22,275
What about you, university student?

622
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:23,075
What do you want to be?

623
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,266
I don’t know yet.

624
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,533
Do you also want to be with Tae like Ba-Mhee?

625
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:29,537
Shut up.

626
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,817
He’s mine.

627
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
You all can leave without me.

628
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:36,417
I forgot something inside.

629
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:37,973
Okay.

630
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,333
Is our footage okay?

631
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,973
I don’t know.

632
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:09,573
I haven’t opened it.

633
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,813
Do you want to say something?

634
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,368
If you’re not going to use it, why did you make us film it?

635
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,915
When’s the client deadline I told you this morning?

636
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,808
6 p.m.

637
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,982
But we didn’t submit it late.

638
00:39:02,177 --> 00:39:06,480
The deadline is 6 p.m., so that means we have to finish editing it at 5 p.m. at the latest.

639
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,093
If we’re going to finish editing at 5 p.m., we have to finish filming between 2 and 3 p.m.

640
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:14,231
If we have to send it to the client by 6 p.m., you can’t submit your work to me at 6 p.m.

641
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,230
I already gave you the brief this morning.

642
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,977
I only asked for one shot. Why did it take you all day?

643
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,440
If you can’t take it, you don’t have to.

644
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,964
I’m serious, not being sarcastic.

645
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:02,897
(The underarm client called. She wants you to make a final revision.)

646
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:03,973
(The brief is in the file.)

647
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,880
(How was your first day of internship?)

648
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,386
(Mine was so much fun. I made the right decision to come here.)

649
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:29,822
(My mentor is amazing, great at teaching me about work,)

650
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,288
(and even treated me to BBQ.)

651
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,320
(Oh, I met the creative guy I told you about.)

652
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:36,195
(He’s going to Cannes Lions this year.)

653
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:43,137
Hey, An.

654
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,208
The client messaged and asked if you could help with her next product too.

655
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:50,568
I already told her you’d probably be busy for the next three months.

656
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:51,626
Until your internship is over.

657
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,671
You can accept that job.

658
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,404
I’ll be free after tomorrow.

659
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,973
(The underarm that’s brighter than your future.)

(Ryan After Work)

661
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,248
(Hey.)

662
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,982
(What’s up?)

663
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,213
(What’s the difference between the agency you’re interning at and the production house I’m at?)

664
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,044
(From my understanding,)

665
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,444
(the first thinks, the latter executes.)

666
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,911
(Watch this clip.)

667
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,293
(What clip?)

668
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:06,711
(It better not be like last time when I barely turned off the sound in time.)

669
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:08,300
(Just watch it.)

670
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,417
An agency receives a brief from a client and comes up with how to create work for them.

671
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:20,995
A production house receives work from the agency and sees how they can bring it to life.

672
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:22,000
(Okay.)

673
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
(But sometimes, they both think and execute.)

674
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,808
(I see.)

675
00:42:27,422 --> 00:42:29,420
(What does a pilot mean?)

676
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,142
(Someone who flies a plane.)

677
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,124
(Be serious.)

678
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:38,524
(At first, I thought that’s the meaning too, but it didn’t make sense in this context.)

679
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,680
(Of course not.)

680
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,946
(It’s a sample clip created to align the client's vision.)

681
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,657

682
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,462

692
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:25,466
I’m no use to anyone.

693
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,955
Excuse me, Jane. Ryan has a question.

694
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,391
The printer is broken.

695
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:32,062
What number should I call?

696
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:34,060
Why do I have to hear about this kind of problem?

697
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:35,555
Can you really not handle it yourself?

698
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:38,391
It’s such a small problem that needs no degree.

699
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:41,137
Look at your frown, Assistant Directors.

700
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:43,013
Why are you all gathered here talking nonsense?

701
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:44,471
Do you have that much free time in your department?

702
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,542
What are you doing walking around everywhere?

703
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,084
Why is it so hard for you to say a word?

00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,137

Just tell me what you’re thinking.

I can’t guess your mind.

707
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,435
So, are you really going to quit?
