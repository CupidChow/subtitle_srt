1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970
How can you move on when you keep doing this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,330
I still miss her.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,770
Win her back. Just try.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,070
What’s the meaning of this?

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,770
I don’t want a grand surprise.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,200
I just want time for us to eat

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,050
and look at each other’s faces like this.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,590
More importantly,

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,540
I just want us to go back to the way we were.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,350
So sweet!

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,410
What about you?

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,410
Do you have any dreams?

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,980
I used to want to become a director,

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,190
but life somehow led me here

15
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,560
so I stopped thinking about it a long time ago.

16
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,140
I don’t know if anyone has told you this

17
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,220
but to me, you’re so cool.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,950
LAST MONTH…

19
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,220
OF INTERNSHIP

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,630
Guys, Tae and I got back together.

21
00:00:58,552 --> 00:00:59,851
(Jane: Good night.) (Ryan: Morning.)

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,457
(I’m at work now.) (Have you eaten, Jane?)

23
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,010
(Are you busy? You’re not replying at all.)

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,630
Wow.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,130
Surprise.

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,880
This is probably the 2000th time you’ve told me.

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,030
Don’t be sarcastic.

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,780
This is big.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,850
It took us time to learn, understand, and get back together.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,870
I’m going crazy.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,870
There’s a lot to learn from this internship

32
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,180
but you chose to learn about Tae.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,630
Why?

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,150
Does everyone need to learn the same thing as you?

35
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,700
Call NASA. I’ve found the center of the universe.

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,940
You’re siding with her?

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,550
Of course, you’re besties now.

38
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,260
Actually, you’ve changed a lot in these three months, Pie.

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,970
Yeah.

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,730
Three months ago, you wouldn’t have taken Ba-Mhee’s side.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,820
You seem more open-minded now.

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,300
It’s been three months.

43
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,390
How could I not learn anything?

44
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,360
Even Pah has changed a lot since he fought with the accounting auntie.

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,970
Actually, after I resolved that issue, it’s like I was reborn.

46
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,800
I used to look down on myself really badly.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I don’t know which TV dramas influenced me.

48
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,090
But no matter where I am now,

49
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,390
in the next five years, I’ll become an art director for foreign films.

50
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,620
You know who hasn’t changed, though?

51
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,200
The number of words he says each day is still exactly the same as three months ago.

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,710
EP 11: TIME BOMB

53
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,790
(Are you off somewhere?)

54
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:18,465
(No one knows.)

55
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,270
(I miss you.)

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,928
(Miss you.)

57
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:42,057
You must be serious about him now.

58
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,447
Hurry up and decide what you want to do.

59
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:54,967
The internship is almost over.

60
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,817
Are you going to leave things unfinished like this?

61
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,087
(Why are you so extra, Ryan? Hahahaha.)

62
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,248
(You said I should tell you what I think, Jane.)

63
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:20,263
(So I’m telling you, I’m thinking of you.)

64
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,397
(We’re sitting just 2 meters apart. Why are you thinking of me so much?)

65
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,687
(I want to talk to you.)

66
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,617
I couldn’t be more serious about him,

67
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,697
but I don’t know if he's serious about me.

68
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:36,687
(You still have things to talk about? We were on the phone for like an hour last night.)

69
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:39,243
(I have 8,000 more to say.)

70
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:44,747
(Why are you so extra, Ryan? Hahahaha.)

71
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,680
You’re…

72
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:54,077
You’re into Jane?

73
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,087
Judy.

74
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,737
You’re into Jane?

75
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:21,647
Since when?

76
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,407
How is that even possible?

77
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,887
That foul-mouthed guy?

78
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:29,557
Or did he force you to like him?

79
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:47,157
Are you really into Jane?

80
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,587
Are you sure you two will last?

81
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,027
He’s an adult.

82
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,687
You’re still in university.

83
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:54,247
Besides, dating without having time for each other

84
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,407
is like a long distance relationship.

85
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:58,077
Are you sure you can manage?

86
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,077
Answer me.

87
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,147
You’re into Jane?

88
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,227
Why didn’t you tell me?

89
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:12,837
Does he know you’re into him?

90
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,607
Or did he fall for you first?

91
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,777
Do you know that he likes you?

92
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:17,777
Do other people know?

93
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,287
You can tell me. I won’t tell anyone.

94
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:20,177
- Pah, please! - 	Come on, tell me.

95
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:23,057
Please.

96
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:23,657
Please, Ryan.

97
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,797
Please.

98
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,247
Please tell me.

99
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:27,437
Why are you dancing?

100
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,157
Huh? Why are you paying me respect?

101
00:07:34,117 --> 00:07:35,687
Alright, no one can hear us now.

102
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:39,217
Spill.

103
00:07:39,237 --> 00:07:40,087
Everything.

104
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,547
Why are you guys forcing him?

105
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,207
But you should tell us.

106
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,087
Are you two together?

107
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,917
But you talked on the phone for an hour

108
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,467
and said you missed each other.

109
00:07:58,987 --> 00:07:59,807
Really?

110
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:02,297
Tae won’t talk to me for more than 20 minutes.

111
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:03,197
Hmm?

112
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:09,017
We just keep talking.

113
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,957
He hasn’t told me if he likes me or not.

114
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,057
Have you asked him?

115
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,467
This kind of thing doesn’t need to be asked.

116
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,567
He should just say how he feels.

117
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:19,277
Maybe he’s not serious.

118
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:21,277
Maybe he thinks you’re just an intern

119
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:22,837
and that you’ll go your separate ways after the three months are over.

120
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:23,497
Ouch.

121
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,617
Intern or not, Jane has to make himself clear

122
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:35,407
and you have the right to ask him how he feels about you.

123
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,417
Tae’s right.

124
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,517
Yeah.

125
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,707
Where is Jane spending his leave today?

126
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,457
Did he tell you?

127
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,177
Oh, Ryan.

128
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:54,916
(Jane: Good night.) (Ryan: Morning.)

129
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:55,802
(I’m at work now.) (Have you eaten, Jane?)

130
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,843
(Are you busy? You’re not replying at all.) (Are you off somewhere?)

131
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,126
(No one knows.) (I miss you.) (Miss you.)

132
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,877
My office decoration is done.

133
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,087
We can actually go and work there.

134
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,577
I feel guilty enough towards Jo and the crew for taking on a side job.

135
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:18,037
I’ve moved the 7th slide to the back and moved the cast reference up.

136
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,237
Honestly, how long are you going to keep doing this?

137
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:25,057
What do you mean?

138
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:28,467
If you’re talking about work, it’s almost done.

139
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,407
I mean, how long will you keep working as an Assistant Director?

140
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,817
Don’t you want to be a director anymore?

141
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,687
If you keep working under Jo, that day will never come.

142
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:46,007
I don’t want—

143
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,387
Why are you lying to yourself?

144
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:51,047
Don’t stick to the same old things.

145
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:55,337
My recently opened company is still missing a talented director like you.

146
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,467
We’re shooting an MV the day after tomorrow.

147
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,617
How about you come and help me?

148
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,917
It’s my senior’s song.

149
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,917
I don’t really like their ideas.

150
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,517
You might be able to help us finalize things.

151
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:11,447
I can’t do that.

152
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:15,877
Up to you then.

153
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:20,617
But please consider my offer to make you a director.

154
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,447
You’re almost 30, Jane.

155
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,907
Follow your heart already.

156
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,507
Have a look at slide 28 and see if you’re okay with it.

157
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:02,917
(When a Gunman Falls in Love With His Target)

158
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,437
(Character: Gunman Who Falls in Love With His Target)

159
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,937
I called you last night, but you didn’t pick up.

160
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:37,477
I was sleeping.

161
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:38,797
Liar.

162
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:42,787
You read my messages at 4 a.m. and didn’t reply.

163
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,087
You didn’t reply to me all day.

164
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:51,667
I only ignored your message once. Why are you complaining?

165
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:57,607
You said I could ask you anything,

166
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:59,127
but when I did, you didn’t answer.

167
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:11,887
Here.

168
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,067
You forgot to add milk.

169
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:25,167
I was busy all day yesterday.

170
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,817
That’s why I called you at night.

171
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,237
Did you not miss me anymore?

172
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:34,917
Can you stop teasing me?

173
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:36,797
I’m not teasing you.

174
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,077
Tell me what’s wrong.

175
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,067
You know I like you

176
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,957
but I don’t know how you feel at all.

177
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,157
I want to see you every day.

178
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:04,217
No matter how busy I am, I want to talk to you every day.

179
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:06,797
That’s how I feel.

180
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:20,956
Why are you running away when you’re shy?

181
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:21,947
Are you crazy?

182
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,777
If you don’t want me to go crazy, make me your boyfriend already.

183
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,927
Can I fill out the internship evaluation form now

184
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,187
or do I need to make a photocopy first?

185
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:46,347
You can fill it out now.

186
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:51,007
I can’t believe it’s been almost three months.

187
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,697
It feels like only a short time has passed.

188
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:59,497
Actually, I’m thinking I might apply for a job here after graduation.

189
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:01,797
Really?

190
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,717
Why? Is Tae also applying?

191
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:08,597
This is not about Tae. It’s my own idea.

192
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,047
I haven’t even talked to him about it.

193
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:24,917
What’s that?

194
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:26,927
A quotation?

195
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,487
A quotation for the MV you helped me pitch.

196
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,087
Here. The client has signed it.

197
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:40,977
Really?

198
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:41,977
Yes.

199
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,107
I have to give you credit, Ba-Mhee.

200
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:50,357
Even the client asked me if the girl who helped me pitch that day was really an intern.

201
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,637
You’re the one who taught me.

202
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:56,287
I was still making mistakes presenting that day.

203
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:04,807
Honestly, this might be the only thing I feel I’ve gotten better at from this internship.

204
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:15,137
Speaking as your mentor, I think you’ve grown a lot.

205
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,847
I remember you first came here

206
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:21,977
to follow your boyfriend and didn’t care about learning anything.

207
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:29,397
Opening your mind to learn about work and make decisions on your own

208
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:33,497
is a great KPI already.

209
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:40,087
You joined because of someone else but you’re completing this because of yourself.

210
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:41,727
Wow.

211
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,497
You’re too kind.

212
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,257
You’ve done really well, Ba-Mhee.

213
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,217
And that made you cry?

214
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:06,827
It’s all good. If it makes you feel better, cry it out.

215
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,657
Okay. See you soon.

216
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:13,567
I need to get back to work now.

217
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:32,647
Excuse me.

218
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:33,787
Yes?

219
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,607
I’ll come back to work on this later.

220
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:38,077
I want to see Ba-Mhee real quick.

221
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:40,457
There’s no rush. You can go.

222
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,077
Thanks.

223
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,517
I’m lonely.

224
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,147
Uncle Moo and the others are out buying things,

225
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,147
so I’m holding the fort alone.

226
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,447
Why are you bothering us?

227
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,657
Jo’s been here all day, but you haven’t scolded him.

228
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,417
I heard that, Pah.

229
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,567
Why are you whispering so loudly?

230
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:06,947
I’m not criticizing you, Jo.

231
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,227
Babe, what are you doing here?

232
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,797
I’ve been looking for you.

233
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,757
Where have you been?

234
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,067
The client has signed the quotation for the MV you came up with ideas for.

235
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,957
Between the two ideas, they chose Pie’s.

236
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,217
When the work is done, I’ll get you an incentive.
(Incentive = something that motivates employees)

237
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,047
It might not be much, but you deserve it.

238
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,357
I don’t think Pie is thinking about money.

239
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,537
She’s freaking out.

240
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:06,427
It’s not that your ideas are bad, but it’s not just about the objective.

241
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,197
It’s also up to the client’s taste.

242
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:13,397
You’re not sad, are you?

243
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:19,257
Who? Me?

244
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:21,847
Your work didn’t get chosen.

245
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,337
Why would I be sad?

246
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:29,527
Like Jane said, these things are up to the client’s taste.

247
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,527
It doesn’t mean your work is bad.

248
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,307
Congratulations, Pie.

249
00:18:42,597 --> 00:18:43,637
Thank you.

250
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,897
You’re so hardworking, first jobbers.

251
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,607
You interned here, came back as employees,

252
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:27,607
and today, you also helped carry the water.

253
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,227
I’m really grateful.

254
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,447
Who could say no to your job offer?

255
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,017
You’re my idol, you know?

256
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:34,847
Thank you so much.

257
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:36,527
I suddenly feel old.

258
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:41,297
For the MV you pitched ideas for, I’ll go with

259
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,967
Nine’s.

260
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,577
You’ll co-direct it with me.

261
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:48,757
If all goes well, you can direct the next project on your own.

262
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:49,457
Sounds good?

263
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,457
Whoa. Are you sure?

264
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,147
I didn’t major in this field.

265
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,607
That doesn’t matter.

266
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,137
What matters is if you have the heart for it.

267
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,947
No matter what major, everyone can do it.

268
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:00,487
You’re not sad, are you, Jane?

269
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:02,377
Jane?

270
00:20:02,997 --> 00:20:04,057
You’re not sad, right?

271
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,997
Great.

272
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,397
You can try again next time.

273
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,127
I’ll do my best.

274
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,207
You won’t be disappointed.

275
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:12,697
Good.

276
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:35,237
What’s up?

277
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,357
Jane, there are some changes to the brief.

278
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,167
Can you come to the office to review it?

279
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:43,067
We agreed that I won’t go to your office.

280
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,637
It’s urgent.

281
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,107
Can you stop by quickly?

282
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,657
We need to talk to the marketing team too.

283
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:52,757
Please. Help me one last time and I won’t trouble you again.

284
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:16,437
If you don’t want me to go crazy, make me your boyfriend already.

285
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,727
You didn’t tap it. Ryan told us to keep tapping it.

286
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,347
The MV shoot tomorrow is giving me so much headache.

287
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:49,687
Are you really not coming to help?

288
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:52,067
Tomorrow is Saturday. Your main job won’t be affected.

289
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,067
I told you I can’t.

290
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,667
I’m still a full-time employee at Jo’s office.

291
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,917
Then quit and become a director.

292
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,267
How long are you going to stay as just a full-time employee?

293
00:22:03,937 --> 00:22:05,937
This really is your time.

294
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,557
If you wait until you’re older, it might be hard to start something new.

295
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:20,087
Hi, Mr. Jane.

296
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,837
Oh, you know each other?

297
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,337
What a coincidence.

298
00:22:24,697 --> 00:22:27,147
Ms. Joy is the client for our MV shoot tomorrow.

299
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,277
This is Jane, the soon-to-be director of my production house.

300
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,317
I’m trying to convince him right now.

301
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:32,627
Nine.

302
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,487
Congratulations.

303
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,277
I just sent you the revised slides.

304
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:48,917
Please excuse me, Ms. Joy.

305
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:49,527
Bye.

306
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:53,527
I’ll be right back.

307
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:54,837
Okay.

308
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:02,557
Please consider my offer.

309
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:04,557
It’s fine if you’re not ready tomorrow.

310
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,847
Whenever you’re ready to follow your dream,

311
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:10,597
you can start here.

312
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,347
If you want to ask something, just go ahead.

313
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:34,057
If I asked, would you get annoyed?

314
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:38,067
No, but I’m annoyed now.

315
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,537
Start eating already, then you can ask me anything.

316
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,167
Where have you been?

317
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,107
If I answered that, would you be mad?

318
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:08,027
No, but I’m mad now.

319
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:16,757
I went to see Nine.

320
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:19,797
He asked me to help with his work. That’s really it.

321
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:22,087
You said the same thing last time.

322
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:26,377
My answer is still the same because it was another work meeting.

323
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:33,427
If I wanted to go back to him, I would’ve done that a long time ago.

324
00:25:35,937 --> 00:25:39,567
I wouldn’t have waited until some kid was sulking at me like this.

325
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:54,237
Here. Let’s make up.

326
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,687
Is that all you’ve got?

327
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,767
Alright. Is this enough?

328
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,127
Is it because you’re so good at pitching

329
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,137
that Nine wants your help?

330
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:37,207
Baimon and Judy said your presentations win clients over every time.

331
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:41,517
I’m not that good. I’ve just been doing this for a long time.

332
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:45,127
Actually, once you get the hang of it, it’s not hard.

333
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,407
Do you enjoy doing it?

334
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,027
No, I’m so tired of it.

335
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:54,787
What about you?

336
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:57,617
Your internship is almost over. What’s next?

337
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:03,797
I don’t know yet, but I’ve been enjoying what I’m doing,

338
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:07,327
especially coming up with ideas for the MV.

339
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:13,137
Aren’t you sad that the client chose Pie’s ideas?

340
00:27:14,537 --> 00:27:15,507
Not at all.

341
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:23,117
Like you said, if I keep practicing, one day the clients will choose mine.

342
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,477
When that day comes, you have to treat me to a meal.

343
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:32,077
Deal.

344
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,727
I’ll take the trash out.

345
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:57,167
Your hand soap smells really nice.

346
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:12,367
Oh, I’ve been meaning to ask, why do you keep old breakdown sheets?

347
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:40,647
Those documents are used when we’re on set.

348
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,877
I always keep them for reference

349
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,277
for future projects.

350
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:50,107
If you want to become an Assistant Director, you should do the same.

351
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:51,857
Okay.

352
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,787
What movie are you looking for?

353
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:12,057
Do you have Deadpool?

354
00:29:12,537 --> 00:29:13,967
Deadpool?

355
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,077
The one with Ryan Reynolds as the male lead?

356
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:19,707
Ryan again, huh?

357
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:23,007
You seem to be into superhero movies lately.

358
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:29,577
People discussed that Deadpool is not a hero and doesn’t act like one.

359
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:34,627
Later in the movie, his friend encourages him to spare an enemy’s life.

360
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:36,217
Does he listen to his friend?

361
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:38,087
He shoots the enemy right in the head.

362
00:29:40,437 --> 00:29:43,777
Oh, now I remember I watched it in the cinema.

363
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,787
Mon really loved it and laughed at every joke.

364
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,387
He wanted to quit to write comedy film scripts, but Jo stopped him in time.

365
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:51,757
Why?

366
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,057
Mon is a natural comedian.

367
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:55,757
Jo said he didn’t want his talent to go to waste.

368
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:04,567
Jo loves molding people to become directors, doesn’t he?

369
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:23,507
Hey.

370
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:28,527
I just want to know why you chose Nine’s ideas.

371
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:34,537
Oh, why shouldn’t I choose his ideas?

372
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:40,827
Are you saying I should’ve chosen yours?

373
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:46,087
I know you worked really hard on it,

374
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:50,087
but at the end of the day, I had to choose the best one.

375
00:30:54,647 --> 00:31:00,457
The thing is…it’s just not your time yet, Jane.

376
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,447
Do you understand?

377
00:31:07,337 --> 00:31:09,847
I had no confidence left to become a director,

378
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:17,637
even after Nine quit and Jo asked me to direct a small project.

379
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,127
Are you nervous?

380
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:22,057
This is your first time co-directing.

381
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:27,857
Jo, could you please choose the prop?

382
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,797
Let’s go with this color.

383
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:31,177
Sure.

384
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:31,777
Thanks.

385
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,327
Excuse me, Jo, could you choose the extra’s outfit?

386
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:37,197
Which one do you prefer?

387
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:38,437
This one.

388
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:38,847
Okay.

389
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,357
Thanks.

390
00:31:41,877 --> 00:31:43,997
It felt like I was in Jo’s shadow.

391
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:48,067
No one thought I could really be a director.

392
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,307
It felt like—

393
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:53,697
It wasn’t your time yet.

394
00:31:58,277 --> 00:32:00,277
But do you still want to be a director now?

395
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,377
Why?

396
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,877
If I did, would you hire me to direct something?

397
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:20,297
If you want to be a director, I’ll encourage you to pursue it.

398
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:24,757
I don’t know when the right time is,

399
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:28,307
but right now, you’re the most talented.

400
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:34,077
I like you this much, partly because you’re a talented person.

401
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:38,727
You can actually be a director, Jane.

402
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:45,177
Are you sure about that?

403
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,257
I am sure.

404
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:51,237
You really can do it.

405
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,947
You said you like me. Are you sure about that?

406
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:05,447
If I wasn’t sure, I wouldn’t have said it.

407
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:07,867
Both about work

408
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:11,287
and my feelings for you.

409
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:19,417
But if you’re not okay with this, it’s fine.

410
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:22,057
I’ll just continue to be an intern.

411
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:27,017
Do you want to be more than just an intern?

412
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,537
Let’s date.

413
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:35,957
That’s enough.

414
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:12,497
(Throw Away)

415
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:48,797
Are you busy with work?

416
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:50,107
Can I help you with anything?

417
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,377
What’s going on?

418
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,377
Why are you in such a good mood?

419
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,687
I bet you two are an item now.

420
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,597
Don’t be too much.

421
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:50,407
We’ve talked about this, remember?

422
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,487
You’re being conservative.

423
00:36:53,487 --> 00:36:57,527
Do you want to tell the whole office that I’m dating an intern?

424
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,617
Aren’t you worried too much?

425
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,787
If someone asks you, just tell them I made the first move.

426
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:05,487
No one cares who made the first move.

427
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:09,277
Anyone who sees us will think I’m manipulating a kid.

428
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,467
You need to learn to defend yourself.

429
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,807
Why have you let people badmouth you all this time?

430
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:19,637
I don’t care what other people think.

431
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,437
I only care about those I want to care about.

432
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:35,987
It doesn’t hurt to tell them your side of the story.

433
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,987
I don’t like when people criticize you.

434
00:37:38,427 --> 00:37:41,927
When you talk to people, learn to speak up for yourself.

435
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:42,727
Stop acting cool.

436
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:51,757
Hello.

437
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,127
Start with this.

438
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:39,987
It took me ages to find this AirPod.

439
00:38:40,437 --> 00:38:42,277
I found it under the sofa.

440
00:38:42,807 --> 00:38:44,997
Pah found the other one.

441
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:47,607
It took a whole year.

442
00:38:51,657 --> 00:38:56,657
Do you remember the day you interviewed for your internship?

443
00:38:56,987 --> 00:38:58,147
We had that interview here.

444
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:02,157
You were still stuttering then.

445
00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:09,127
If I wasn’t good, why did you hire me?

446
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,787
You should already know the answer.

447
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:14,917
If someone’s already talented, why would they intern?

448
00:39:25,557 --> 00:39:27,047
What else do you want to ask me?

449
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,287
Why did you choose Nine that day?

450
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:38,087
Why didn’t you choose me?

451
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,687
What did I lack that made you say it wasn’t my time yet?

452
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:57,587
To me, you’re one of the best Assistant Directors I know.

453
00:39:59,587 --> 00:40:01,257
You always have a backup plan.

454
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:03,477
You see the big picture

455
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,087
and understand all environments.

456
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:10,297
But I don’t want to be an Assistant Director.

457
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:17,297
Ever since you didn’t choose me,

458
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,837
I’ve been too scared to dream of anything, you know?

459
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:27,577
Is it because of me or yourself?

460
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:38,507
Even the ideas you submitted that day were meant to please me.

461
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:40,927
Think carefully.

462
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:47,807
Do you want to keep being in my shadow or become a real director?

463
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:10,793
How did it go?

464
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:11,884
Are you okay?

465
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:16,800
Do you still want to be with me?

466
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,466
No matter what I do, will things stay the same between us?

467
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,429
Jane, have you seen this?

468
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:36,095
(When a Gunman)

469
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:44,400
(Falls in Love With His Target)

470
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:57,877
Isn’t this our intern’s idea?

471
00:41:57,927 --> 00:41:58,937
Why is it showing here?

472
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,291
What were you doing with Nine when you were on leave last week?

473
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:28,036
(Ryan After Work)

474
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:31,222
(5 Interns, Class of 24)
(Pie, do you think I can be a director?)

475
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:32,597
(Of course.)

476
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,844
(You’re being weird today.)

477
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:36,393
(Do you want to switch career paths?)

478
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,947
(Can he do that?)

479
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:42,087
(Don’t directors have to graduate in directing?)

480
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,509
(Not necessarily.)

481
00:42:44,531 --> 00:42:47,702
(Look at Nolan.)

482
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:50,633
(Why do you want to be a director now, Pah?)

483
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,000
(I don’t.)

484
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:55,397
(I just thought the group was quiet, so I started a random conversation.)

485
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
(Are you Anti-Silent Majority?)

486
00:42:58,437 --> 00:43:01,484
(What a talkative guy.)

487
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:06,167
(A director’s job is to define all the directions in a project.)

488

(If you have stories to tell and a clear enough vision,)

489
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,753
(you can communicate that with the crew,)

490
00:43:13,782 --> 00:43:15,747
(but above all,)

491
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:19,455
(you need to make the people who hire you believe in you)

492
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:22,087
(and that you can get the job done.)

493
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:24,982
(Directors actually come from many backgrounds—)

494

00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:34,386
(Some are former Assistant Directors.)

496
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,307
(Mhee!!!!)

497
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:38,393
(You can come from any background.)

498
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:40,691
(The rest depends on your work.)

(There’s a crew ready to support you.)

500
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:47,338
(Just like how we’re ready to support you, Ryan.)

00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:49,935
(Rooting for you.)

502
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:51,817
(Hugs.)

503
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,917
(It’s okay.)

504
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:57,557
(Yeah.)

505
00:43:57,658 --> 00:43:59,557
The whole office is gossiping about Jane.

506
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,942
Did he really sell your work to another production house?

507
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:03,615
We don’t know the truth yet.

508
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:05,557
Let’s not talk nonsense.

509
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,917
I remember the first day we met.

510
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,097
None of you were any good.

511
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:14,611
Today, I can say you guys have done really well.

512
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,607
Thank you for the past three months.

513
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:17,978
Thank you so much.

514
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:19,833
Well done.

515
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:23,011
Thank you, Ryan, for everything.
