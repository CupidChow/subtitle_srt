1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,153
Have you secured an internship?

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:04,363
All the places are closing their applications soon.

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:06,543
Have you even applied anywhere?

4
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:07,733
I don’t know.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:11,563
Are you two interviewing for the Assistant Director role?

6
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,163
Get up. I’m in a hurry. Come on.

7
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:15,723
You don’t want to be late.

8
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,823
You don’t look like your photo.

9
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,543
Well, that’s not my resume.

10
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,393
- The thing is… - Hello?

11
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,283
You got me the wrong resume again.

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,263
What’s your name?

13
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,093
It’s Ryan.

14
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:28,093
If you still want to intern, you better get started.

15
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:29,423
(Ryan)

16
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,793
Mon wants all the interns to help me film this pilot.

17
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:34,783
However, I’ll have you guys film only one shot.

18
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:36,133
Here you go, Jane.

19
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:39,783
When’s the client deadline I told you this morning?

20
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:41,813
6 p.m.

21
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:44,783
But we didn’t submit it late.

22
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,673
I only asked for one shot. Why did it take you all day?

23
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:49,783
If you can’t take it, you don’t have to.

24
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:51,863
I’m serious, not being sarcastic.

25
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:55,053
You can accept that job.

26
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,593
I’ll be free after tomorrow.

27
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,873
(Nong Ink’s Printing)

28
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:14,383
(Ryan)

29
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,613
An, how’s your internship going?

30
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,573
I’m no use to anyone.

31
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:28,923
Have you seen my glasses?

32
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:31,033
Here they are.

33
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,343
You forgot them in the photo room.

34
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,533
An, don’t leave yet.

35
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:39,453
Come help me carry these.

36
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,943
So, are you really going to quit?

37
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:57,353
Yeah.

38
00:01:58,453 --> 00:01:59,413
It’s up to you,

39
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,863
but if they scold you, scold them back.

40
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:04,003
Don’t give in to them.

41
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:10,043
Anyway, where’s the file they sent for printing?

42
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,033
In Teacher Noi’s folder.

43
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:14,033
We need to print 2 color copies, and the rest in black and white.

44
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:15,203
Okay.

45
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:16,573
I’m off now.

46
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,313
Dad.

47
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:20,893
Hmm?

48
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,093
I left the camera battery charging near the limbo.

49
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,853
Someone’s coming to get their photos taken today.

50
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:26,453
Okay.

51
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:27,713
Go now.

52
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,353
Do your best at work.

53
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:38,933
Ink, when you’re done using the camera, don’t forget to charge the battery.

54
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:40,033
Dad always forgets.

55
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,163
Yeah.

56
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:50,613
EP 2: IMPORTANT ROLE

57
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,073
Are we interning or working at a printing house?

58
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,363
What are we even learning from this?

59
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:30,153
(Breakdown sheet = filming schedule)

60
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,503
Have you never seen a breakdown sheet?

61
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:44,743
What?

62
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,703
You’re an Assistant Director intern but you don’t know what a breakdown sheet is.

63
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:00,283
You’re confused, aren’t you?

64
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:10,743
This column shows the shots we’re going to film.

65
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,743
Ugh. This is getting too much, Prang.

66
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:14,743
They can’t ask us to change it now and expect us to complete it in time.

67
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:17,243
Hello?

68
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,421
Yes. Just find whatever you can.

69
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:24,083
They want to change it at the last minute. No one is going to make it.

70
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,186
Yes, I said just find whatever you can.

71
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,777
That’s it.

72
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,359
Those shades of green are not enough.

73
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:45,728
We actually need to find more. I’ll quickly share our selections.

74
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,813
How are we going to finish filming it in time?

75
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:51,017
If our OT hours exceed, we’re all going to be in trouble.

76
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,910
How could you agree to the client’s new brief and throw us under the bus?

77
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,528
The shooting is tomorrow, not next month.

78
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,297
We might have to ask the client to come early tomorrow, Judy, at 7 a.m.

79
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,915
We’re going to film everything first, including the product.

80
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,075
Then we can film the scenes with changes in the evening.

81
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:14,253
Are you serious, Jane?

82
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:17,657
They want to change from an ordinary man to a superhero.

83
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,284
We have to deal with the costume and the props.

84
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,733
The work is going to turn out badly.

85
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,030
What do you want us to do?

86
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:24,023
Call the client and say we won’t do it anymore?

87
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:29,497
I’ll try to switch the breaks and give the costuming team more time to work in the morning.

88
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,225
We can film the superhero scenes in the evening.

89
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,790
Yeah, it’s easy to move things around when you’re not doing it yourself, Jane.

90
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:37,783
What about the sword?

91
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,693
Do you want me or the costuming to prepare it?

92
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,453
Please do it.

93
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,875
Costuming has enough on our plate already.

94
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,995
I wasn’t complaining. I was just asking.

95
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,853
Props need to be changed too.

96
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,426
It’s tough for everyone.

97
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,190
Adjust the overtime budget, Prang.
(Adjust overtime budget = set aside budget for overtime expenses)

98
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:55,177
The location I contacted is charging 10 thousand for each additional hour.

99
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,541
Jane, don’t forget to leave some time to set up the cameras and the lighting.

100
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,924
There’s a hero landing scene in the new brief.

101
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:01,719
It’ll take at least half an hour to set up.

102
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,546
Can we target to finish at 6 p.m.?

103
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,703
I’ll ask for one more hour.

104
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,475
Can you print the storyboard for me?

105
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,973
I need 15 color copies and 30 black and white copies.

106
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:27,524
The color copies are for all the team leads and five people on the client team.

107
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,048
The black and white copies are to be given out to the other team members by tomorrow.

108
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:32,244
45 copies.

109
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,813
Hey. What’s wrong with the printer?

110
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:53,950
The paper is probably stuck.

111
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:09,253
I think something’s wrong with the machine.

112
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,844
The ink is still full and there’s no paper stuck.

113
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,057
We have to find a technician’s number.

114
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:17,266
Hey. Have you seen my message?

115
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,524
The client is God, you know?

116
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:20,679
The client is God.

117
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,043
That Assistant Director is so foul-mouthed.

118
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,759
Yeah. That’s it.

119
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,075
Let’s go with what I sent you in the message.

120
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:27,470
Let me know if it’s possible.

121
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:28,057
Yeah.

122
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:30,608
What era is the hero from?

123
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,924
Why is he still using a sword?

124
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,777
Go find the props that Jane briefed us on.

125
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:35,586
I have a headache.

126
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:36,093
Go.

127
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,279
What do we do about the printer?

128
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:40,448
Why aren’t they picking up?

129
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:44,928
Ryan,

130
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,693
ask Jane what number to call.

131
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,663
No. Let’s find it ourselves.

132
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:52,741
Excuse me, Jane.

133
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:55,097
Ryan has a question.

134
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:06,466
The printer is broken.

135
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:08,463
What number should I call?

136
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,648
Why do I have to hear about this kind of problem?

137
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,008
Can you really not handle it yourself?

138
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,301
It’s only my second day.

139
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:20,759
I’m sorry.

140
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:22,368
Great.

141
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,097
Because it’s your second day, you don’t deserve to be scolded?

142
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:29,195
It’s such a small problem that needs no degree to know how to solve.

143
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:54,021
What are you looking for, Jo?

144
00:09:56,033 --> 00:10:02,253
I remember that the printer technician’s number starts with 02.

145
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:06,110
Here it is.

146
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:06,875
I found it.

147
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,439
The line is busy.

148
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,433
Yes. It’s also busy when I tried.

149
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,390
I can’t get through. The line is busy.

150
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:27,026
Same here.

151
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,275
I hope he’s still using this number.

152
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:30,261
Let’s try again.

153
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,119
Again, the line is busy.

154
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:37,968
Hey!

155
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:40,546
You’re calling at the same time.

156
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,190
Oh, that’s right.

157
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,195
Oh.

158
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:47,666
You call him then, Ryan.

159
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,199
Okay.

160
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:49,799
Gosh.

161
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:54,253
Can you get through?

162
00:10:58,253 --> 00:10:59,915
Let’s go with this order tomorrow.

163
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,604
1, 5, 4…

164
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:13,221
Look at your frowns, Assistant Directors.

165
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:18,563
Your boyfriend is no different than us.

166
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:21,399
It’s chaos.

167
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,915
What we already shot didn't pass the censorship

168
00:11:24,137 --> 00:11:25,275
because there’s a shot of a monk driving.

169
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,501
Babe, have you taken the vitamins I gave you?

170
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:33,693
You use your eyes all day so you must take care of them, you know?

171
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,888
And why did that monk have to drive?

172
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,753
He’s the reason you have a headache now.

173
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:42,466
Can’t a monk drive?

174
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,448
The mentors indulge the client too much.

175
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,893
I wonder if they’re giving their own parents the same treatment.

176
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,386
They agree to everything the client asks to change.

177
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,310
If they ask us to rename the office, I’m sure they’ll do it too.

178
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:02,973
Oh, shit.

179
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:04,821
What’s stressing you guys?

180
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:08,875
How long have you been here?

181
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:10,973
They made me start fixing this table this morning.

182
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,390
Why are you all gathered here talking nonsense?

183
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,964
Do you have that much free time in your department?

184
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:30,626
So many things about tomorrow’ shoot are not going to plan so it’s a little chaotic.

185
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:36,075
I want you to help your mentors, so it’s not tiring on set tomorrow.

186
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,106
Is that okay?

187
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,737
Ba-Mhee, come with me.

188
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:47,195
Come on.

189
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,679
(Resignation Form)

190
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,928
Jane, come help me with the test.

191
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:48,626
I’ll follow you. Give me a moment to fix the breaks.

192
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,639
Alright, come.

193
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:13,008
(Resignation Form)

194
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:25,248
What? Of course, the location team has to wake up early.

195
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,030
Why the hell are they quitting now?

196
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,023
Your crew have no patience at all.

197
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,884
What other green can it be? It’s dark green like the client’s corporate identity.

198
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,621
Which dark green? The color code is in the group chat.

199
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:49,959
Where’s Baimon?

200
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:53,381
Are we going to let the intern handle the test alone?

201
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,199
I’m coming.

202
00:14:55,143 --> 00:14:56,244
Give me a moment.

203
00:14:56,953 --> 00:15:00,430
Of course, we need to use the crane for the hero landing.

204
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:01,488
Just a moment, Ball.

205
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,306
Hello? Baimon is not here.

206
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,337
Hello? Baimon…

207
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,724
Okay, I’ll let Baimon know.

208
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:13,781
What is it?

209
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,973
Both the front and the back must be dark green.

210
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:17,861
The cap must be dark green.

211
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,115
The shoes must also be dark green.

212
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,524
If you’re going to make underpants, make them dark green too.

213
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:45,515
Pick it up.

214
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,479
Don’t let me hear the telephone ring again.

215
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:52,555
Hello?

216
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:07,728
What is it?

217
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:17,124
The casting team called and said,

218
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:26,279
“Jane, the uncle extra is not available anymore. Something urgent came up.”

219
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:28,021
“We’re so sorry.”

220
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:33,435
How are you going to deal with this problem?

221
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:39,275
Find a new one.

222
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,279
How?

223
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:44,546
Would you like anything else?

224
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,821
Uh,

225
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:52,688
I’ll…I’ll ask the uncle at the restaurant to play the role.

226
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,839
Is that your solution?

227
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,604
Good. Do it.

228
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,337
Find the new extra according to the casting brief.

229
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,217
Go ahead.

230
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:06,786
Sure.

231
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,839
(Reference for Extra: Retired Man)

232
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,253
Did Jane scold you?

233
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,986
Hey. What are you daydreaming about?

234
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,235
I asked how you are doing. What did he ask you to do?

235
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,519
Find an extra.

236
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,124
Excuse me, Auntie.

237
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,673
Is the uncle not here today?

238
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,673
The uncle didn’t come in today.

239
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:21,673
(Aon from Casting: This is the line the actor needs to say.)

240
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,435
(Join us to overcome the struggles related to finance during retirement.)

241
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,590
I got to go find an extra.

242
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:37,497
All mine.

243
00:18:41,906 --> 00:18:43,177
What makes you so hungry?

244
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:07,373
Uncle.

245
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,150
Where do you want to go, young man?

246
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:15,497
Join us to…

247
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:17,493
Hold on a second, Uncle.

248
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:22,786
I’ll count 1, 2, 3, then you can start speaking.

249
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,195
Alright. Sorry.

250
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,048
Okay.

251
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,368
1, 2, 3.

252
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,021
Join us to come over the struggles related to…

253
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:38,839
Relax, Uncle. No rush. Don’t be nervous.

254
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,453
Let’s try again.

255
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,675
1, 2, 3.

256
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:47,381
Join us to overcome the struggles related to…

257
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:49,559
Overcome…

258
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,048
Let me try again.

259
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:52,777
Over.

260
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:53,710
Over.

261
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:54,430
Come.

262
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,608
Overcome the struggles related to…

263
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:00,501
Overcome…

264
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,773
Overcome the struggles.

265
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,141
Overcome the struggles!

266
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,510
Overcome the conflict!

267
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:09,168
Overcome the struggles.

268
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:10,901
Oh gosh.

269
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:13,853
It’s difficult. Can I say something else?

270
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,853
I can’t say it properly.

271
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:16,413
Please.

272
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:18,119
Please.

273
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:32,795
If you give me two more days, I’ll be able to do it for sure.

274
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,023
Oh, shit.

275
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,248
Here you go, Uncle.

276
00:20:48,283 --> 00:20:49,506
Please don’t step on it.

277
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,608
Fruits, anyone? Come and check them out.

278
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:08,270
I’m sorry.

279
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,244
I’m sorry.

280
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,928
Excuse me, do you have 5 minutes to talk?

281
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:38,999
Yeah.

282
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,510
I’m looking for an extra who has to say a line.

283
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:50,030
Here are the details and the budget from the casting team.

284
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,244
I’m interested.

285
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:56,039
Shall we do a camera test?

286
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,728
Let’s find somewhere quiet.

287
00:21:58,243 --> 00:21:58,893
Of course.

288
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:04,466
(Ryan)

289
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:11,168
Hello. I’m Tu Somyut Chanyai.

290
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,195
I’m a 55-year-old salesman.

291
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,719
Can I say the line now?

292
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes, please.

293
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:22,715
Join us to overcome the struggles related to finance during retirement.

294
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:25,319
Wow.

295
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,035
How did I do?

296
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:27,897
Was that okay?

297
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:29,310
That was amazing.

298
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,706
You’re a great actor.

299
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,435
I get a lot of extra roles.

300
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,973
I’ve had experience.

301
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:42,821
By the way, if the pay is more than 3,000 baht, there’ll be a 1,000 baht deposit

302
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:44,306
Did the casting team tell you that?

303
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,684
Let me ask them.

304
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:52,537
I always get lowballed by film sets.

305
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,884
If you ask them, they’ll do the same thing to me.

306
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:02,821
I can pay you first.

307
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:06,253
I’m in a hurry to get back. I don’t want to be late.

308
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:08,635
That’s great.

309
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,106
Please tell the casting team about this later.

310
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,755
I will.

311
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:12,955
Can I scan your QR?

312
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:13,755
Yes.

313
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:19,968
Done.

314
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,030
I’ll call you this evening.

315
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:23,861
Thank you so much.

316
00:23:23,897 --> 00:23:25,284
Don’t forget to call me.

317
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:31,835
At least, something good happened.

318
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:38,012
Hello. I’m Tu Somyut Chanyai.

319
00:23:38,013 --> 00:23:39,906
I’m a 55-year-old salesman.

320
00:23:39,933 --> 00:23:41,710
Can I say the line now?

321
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,706
Yes, please.

322
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:50,350
Join us to overcome the struggles related to finance during retirement.

323
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,270
Okay. This one will do.

324
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,950
Forward this to the casting team.

325
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,221
I need to talk to the other teams now.

326
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:17,461
(Resignation Form)

327
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,893
At least, I did something useful before I quit.

328
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,793
(Resignation Form)

329
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,293
(Reason for resignation: Want to pursue a career aligned with my studies.)

330
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:53,266
You need a signature from your department before giving this to me.

331
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:55,861
Really?

332
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:23,853
Did you really study art?

333
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:26,430
You have to mix yellow with blue to get green.

334
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:29,373
We also have to add black to make it dark green.

335
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,884
If you don’t know, try listening to other people for a change.

336
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:35,470
Don’t be sarcastic.

337
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:36,919
I’m not.

338
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,981
I’m just telling you how it is.

339
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,048
You’re being sarcastic.

340
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:40,653
I’m not.

341
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:41,204
You are.

342
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,013
I’m just telling you how to mix them.

343
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:43,070
You’re being sarcastic.

344
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:44,075
I’m not.

345
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,195
Don’t be sarcastic to me.

346
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,217
- I’m just telling you that when you mix in black, you get dark green.
- You’re being sarcastic.

347
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:50,315
I’m not. I’m just telling you that when you add black,

348
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,319
Excuse me.

349
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,703
Have you seen Baimon?

350
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:11,897
Hey, put the tip of the sword on the floor or the color will get to the holder.

351
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:14,350
I already covered it with newspaper.

352
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:14,973
It can still get inside.

353
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:15,755
How?

354
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:16,253
It’s going to be messy.

355
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:17,968
You’re such a know-it-all, huh?

356
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,373
Ba-Mhee.

357
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:24,270
Hmm?

358
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,115
Have you seen Baimon?

359
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,633
He came to talk about the graphics earlier.

360
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:32,013
Why don’t you ask Jane?

361
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:40,013
Is he going to be everywhere?

362
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:44,404
Ryan.

363
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:52,955
Please tell Tae, “I miss you and want you to get off work early.”

364
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:10,066
What are you doing walking around everywhere?

365
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,781
I’m looking for Baimon.

366
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:15,257
Why are you looking for him?

367
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:23,328
Hey, why is it so hard for you to say a word?

368
00:27:24,066 --> 00:27:26,063
Do your listeners have to wait all day?

369
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:40,733
Jane, Baimon has already watched the video of that extra.

370
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:42,173
He said he really likes him.

371
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,075
He likes him even more than the one I found.

372
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:54,075
If you want to thank someone, thank him.

373
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,073
He was the one who found him.

374
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:06,048
But if you’re waiting for him to speak, you’ll probably have to wait until tomorrow.

375
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,043
Don’t tell the junior off.

376
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,906
The sword belongs to Gryffindor.

377
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,168
Have you really watched it?

378
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:37,613
Of course, but there are so many names.

379
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,603
I can’t really remember now.

380
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,079
But I remember this. Leviorsa.

381
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:43,301
Sorry. You said it wrong.

382
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:48,528
It’s actually Leviosa, not Leviorsa.

383
00:28:50,983 --> 00:28:52,661
Ryan, it’s good you’re here.

384
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,746
Let’s go to the costume room.

385
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,743
They want to try the sword with the costume.

386
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:57,684
Hey.

387
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:01,835
Yeah, yeah, smarty.

388
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:03,106
Leviosa it is.

389
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:08,626
Great. I love it.

390
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:11,319
Please tighten the shoulders evenly on both sides.

391
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:12,946
Tighten them more.

392
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:20,226
Here you go.

393
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:23,639
Stop it.

394
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:28,670
Tae,

395
00:29:30,663 --> 00:29:32,173
Ba-Mhee asked me to tell you,

396
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:35,079
“I miss you and want you to get off work early.”

397
00:29:39,073 --> 00:29:41,524
Damn. That’s cringe.

398
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,350
What are you doing?

399
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:55,193
Your outfit is so tight.

400
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:57,399
Ba-Mhee!

401
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:00,261
Okay.

402
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:05,684
Not now.

403
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,968
Let them take his photos and send them to the client first.

404
00:30:09,817 --> 00:30:10,430
Ready?

405
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:11,817
I’ll start taking photos now.
Come on. You’re like Superman.

406
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,568
Take the robe off.

407
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:14,973
Lower your sword a bit.

408
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:18,315
Stand looking sharp.

409
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,417
Chest up. Shoulders back. Yes.

410
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:21,888
Left.

411
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:23,710
Well done.

412
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,703
Amazing.

413
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:26,679
Sharp. Yes.

414
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:28,439
Look confident.

415
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:30,075
Hold the sword properly. Yes.

416
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:31,159
Great.

417
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,977
Thank you. We’re done.

418
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:49,479
I added you all to the group.

419
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,999
“5 Interns, Class of 24”

420
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:01,337
Whoa, you’re too serious.

421
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:03,381
Let’s name it something cool.

422
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:07,604
How about “Wingardium Levi-o-sa, Class of 24”?

423
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:08,964
Will you stop teasing me already?

424
00:31:10,893 --> 00:31:12,724
The costume got a green light.

425
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,039
I just heard from the client.

426
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:20,670
Finally, after so many attempts.

427
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,804
That Assistant Director Jane is also really strict.

428
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,693
He’s annoying.

429
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,693
He’s strict with you all too, isn’t he?

430
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,577
I understand an Assistant Director like Jane

431
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:34,910
but I’m sick of the tasks he’s assigned us.

432
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:37,479
Like staple papers and photocopy.

433
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,719
What’s all that? None of it is serious work.

434
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,253
Come on. Don’t you like easy work?

435
00:31:42,555 --> 00:31:46,635
Anyway, I think Jane has an issue.

436
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,550
He can’t stand even a little mistake.

437
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,444
Jane, Baimon has already watched the video of that extra.

438
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,617
He said he really likes him.

439
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,448
He likes him even more than the one I found.

440
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:59,639
If you want to thank someone, thank him.

441
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:01,497
He was the one who found him.

442
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:06,866
He’s so sharp-tongued, especially to the crew.

443
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,919
We can’t even make a little mistake.

444
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:09,764
He’s not like that.

445
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,613
Are you Jane’s favorite now?

446
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:24,057
No.

447
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:31,408
Ryan, I sent you a photo.

448
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:35,488
Please forward it to the extra so he knows he has to wear that costume.

449
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:36,510
It’s final now.

450
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,524
Okay.

451
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,284
(Cannot Send Message. You’re temporarily blocked from the conversation.)

452
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:19,275
Excuse me.

453
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:23,355
Do they like any of the other extras you proposed?

454
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:24,599
No.

455
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:26,208
Mon crossed out all of them.

456
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:02,164
Just say what you want to say.

457
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,319
Why are you just standing there?

458
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,284
I can’t guess your mind.

459
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:12,946
Are you going to speak or not?

460
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:23,613
Hey, are you crying?

461
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:32,546
That extra I found blocked me.

462
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:35,461
I tried to contact him but I couldn’t get a hold of him.

463
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,488
We can find someone else. Why are you crying?

464
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:44,964
I’m hurt. He cheated me out of money and blocked me.

465
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:45,488
What?

466
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,066
He cheated you out of money too?

467
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:55,079
He asked me to transfer him a 1,000 baht deposit.

468
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:58,804
I didn’t think he’d do that. He seemed like a very good guy.

469
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:01,479
I’m so sorry, Jane.

470
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:14,288
From now on, don’t ever use your own money to pay for anything again.

471
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,119
If there’s anything you don’t know, ask me.

472
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:22,261
Did he also threaten you for anything else other than the 1,000 baht?

473
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,057
Listen.

474
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,986
You’re an intern.

475
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,573
Don’t make that kind of decision on your own again.

476
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:36,288
Otherwise, what’s the need for a mentor?

477
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:42,430
I’m sorry for ruining the work.

478
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,133
I’ll take responsibility by resigning.

479
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:48,581
Hey, this is not a parliament

480
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:52,457
where you have to show your spirit by resigning after making mistakes.

481
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:56,875
You’re not in the wrong.

482
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,964
You just weren't careful.

483
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:03,257
If you want to be an Assistant Director, you need to be more mindful.

484
00:36:07,603 --> 00:36:09,266
Could you please sign this for me?

485
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:11,915
I don’t want to work here anymore.

486
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:13,195
I can’t do it.

487
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,193
If I stay, I’ll only be in your way.

488
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,193
I’m so useless.

489
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,213
Here you go.

490
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:43,381
If you want to quit, hand the form to HR.

491
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:55,968
The printer has been fixed now.

492
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:00,564
We used the technician you called this morning.

493
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,195
Thank you.

494
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:06,501
What’s wrong? You’re emotional.

495
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,386
You should thank him, not me.

496
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:10,377
Thank this technician.

497
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,373
It’s fixed and ready for printing.

498
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:31,461
Hey, are you open to an extra job?

499
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:43,461
Move the light a bit to the right.

500
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:46,928
Okay.

501
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:50,288
When you’re ready, please start.

502
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:18,208
(Here’s another casting video for the hero role.)

503
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:28,350
(Amazing!!)

504
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,146
Don’t trust anyone so easily again.

505
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,743
You’re unlikely to get lucky like this every time.

506
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:52,493
Got it.

507
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:56,181
I’m sorry again for causing trouble.

508
00:38:56,843 --> 00:38:58,093
I just wanted to help.

509
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:01,093
Actually, you’re not a bad assistant.

510
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,413
By the way, were you named after Ryan Giggs?

511
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:16,261
Who’s that?

512
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:19,986
He’s known for making the most assists in the league,

513
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:21,070
if I remember correctly.

514
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:28,724
An assist means passing the ball to others to score a goal.

515
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:34,413
But I haven’t passed any balls or anything to anyone to score a goal.

516
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:42,021
You didn’t score a goal or find the extra,

517
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,568
but at least you got my printer working today.

518
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:56,608
If you still want to come back tomorrow, I’ll see you at the office.

519
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,661
We leave the office at 5:30 a.m.

520
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,753
You’re going to experience the real thing, Ryan.

521
00:40:29,453 --> 00:40:31,328
How’s your second day of internship?

522
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:33,079
It was okay. And you?

523
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:36,884
My angel of a mentor yesterday turned into a barking dog today.

524
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:38,821
I shouldn’t have praised him for an hour.

525
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,013
Today, I got badly scolded.

526
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:43,621
Also, I’m not a planner intern but I was asked to plan all day.

527
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:49,061
Excuse me, can you pass me the ball?

528
00:40:51,573 --> 00:40:54,030
An assist means passing the ball to others to score a goal.

529
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:02,901
Yay!

530
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:09,159
By the way, were you named after Ryan Giggs?

531
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:11,479
Actually, you’re not a bad assistant.

532
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:16,146
You didn’t score a goal or find the extra,

533
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,053
but at least you got my printer working today.

534
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,555
Yay!

535
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:32,635
Hello?

536
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:44,608
What’s going on with you?

537
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:46,404
Nothing.

538
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,066
Are you going to dump the trash?

539
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:49,559
Let me do it.

00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,328
Did you let her go home?
