1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,982
As if sipping water is going to break your hard disk.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,675
Come with me.

3
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:03,310
Come on.

4
00:00:03,342 --> 00:00:04,190
- Ba-Mhee. - 		If you don’t take it now,

5
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,333
don’t take it at all.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,631
This is the hard disk Jane is looking for.

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,675
I think I should confess it to him.

8
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:15,964
No, you can’t.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,697
You could be disqualified from your internship.

10
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,186
What the hell did you guys do?

11
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:23,146
Do you think I’m angry with you for dropping the hard disk?

12
00:00:23,182 --> 00:00:25,511
I’m angry that you guys acted without thinking.

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,728
If any files leaked when you took the hard disk out, you’d be sued, Tae.

14
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,071
I’m sorry.

15
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,142
I dared to speak up

16
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,657
because I might not get to come back here tomorrow.

17
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:38,400
I was mad that Jane didn’t let me help run the set.

18
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,817
I was mad about being assigned to a small unit.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,810
I thought I was smart.

20
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:46,711
Pie, being confident is not wrong

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,382
but we’re working as a team.

22
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:52,800
Jane asked you to run Unit B as a trial before your real project.

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,391
For the next TVC shoot, you’ll be a second Assistant Director after Jane.

24
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,644
Thank you.

25
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:01,217
I’ll remember this day for the rest of my life.

26
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:04,710
(Nong Ink’s Printing)

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,382
Give me the biggest size and most expensive frame.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,302
Price is not a concern.

29
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:13,964
But I need it today, as soon as possible.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,542
We need time to print it.

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,377
Just send me your photo.

32
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:20,506
I’ll try to add the text.

33
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,697
What do you want me to write?

34
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,897
Well, I’ll go with,

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,160
“Love forever. Love you the most.”

36
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:32,620
“Not a day goes by that I don’t miss you.”

37
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,320
Something like that.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,191
I already sent you the photo.

39
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,915
Call me when you’re done.

40
00:01:43,422 --> 00:01:44,684
Please make it quick.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,040
Sure.

42
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,302
“Love you the most.”

43
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,653
“Not a day goes by that I don’t miss you.”

44
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,835
How about this one, Ink?

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,697
Get a brighter-colored one.

46
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,782
Her boyfriend will probably like it.

47
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,088
What’s wrong?

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,222
It’s the puppy.

49
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,297
It has gone back to heaven.

50
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,773
EP 5: KNOW MORE

51
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:57,857
Wow, Pie.

52
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,191
You’re so early.

53
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,826
I arrived at my usual time.

54
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:03,297
An hour in advance is usual for you?

55
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,511
The traffic wasn’t bad today.

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,693
Are you excited about becoming the second Assistant Director?

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,186
Not really. I’m just doing what they ask.

58
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,622
Hey, but you have to work with me.

59
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,186
We can be Assistant Director 2.1 and 2.2, maybe.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,084
How many Assistant Directors are there?

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,293
It depends on the set.

62
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,666
If it’s a small set, there’s only one Assistant Director.

63
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,466
The role is exactly as the name suggests: to help the Director.

64
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:54,542
If the Director is the head, the Assistant is the two hands.

65
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,293
They help build on all the Director’s ideas.

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
Some Assistants grow to become Directors.

67
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,540
Hey, there’s an error here.

68
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,435
Just a moment.

69
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,897
So that means Jane can become a Director, right?

70
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:10,026
Of course.

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,137
To even become an Assistant Director like Jane, you need a lot of experience.

72
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,933
But I don’t think Jane wants to become a Director.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,951
If he did, he would’ve done it a long time ago.

74
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,577
I only need one copy.

75
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,306
Okay.

76
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,626
Don’t sigh.

77
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:43,733
I told you if you carried a hard disk again, I wouldn’t walk with you.

78
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,906
I’m holding on to it so tightly.

79
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:47,804
It won’t fall.

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,711
When will you stop taking work home?

81
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:55,262
You need some personal time after work.

82
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,315
Now you get tense every time you breathe in,

83
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,031
afraid it’ll affect this thing.

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,111
Tell me, this is your plan to steal my boyfriend, right?

85
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:03,911
Say it.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,360
Ba-Mhee, I just want to get work done quickly

87
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,937
so we can spend time together on our anniversary.

88
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:20,533
Oh, babe.

89
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,902
Ba-Mhee,

90
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:28,000
are you still holding up okay with interning at the same place as me?

91
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:34,684
Yes,

92
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,848
I’m just bummed that we’re interning at the same place but don’t get to see each other.

93
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,177
But it’s okay.

94
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,386
I can be anywhere as long as I get to be near you.

95
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,004
I’ll find more time to be with you.

96
00:06:58,506 --> 00:06:59,946
Hang in there.

97
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,448
It’ll be over in three months.

98
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,360
Okay.

99
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,084
Let’s go.

100
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,093
Let’s go.

101
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:16,666
Are you sure you’re still holding up okay?

102
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,660
I’m busy with the new TVC

103
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,195
but I have work for you.

104
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:24,764
Someone Baimon knows wants to make a music video.

105
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:27,102
We don’t have ideas to present to the client yet.

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,253
I’ll send you the song so you can listen to it

107
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:31,724
and come up with ideas for pitching.

108
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,582
Okay.

109
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:35,457
Pitching?

110
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,764
Create a pitch deck like you would for a school assignment presentation.

111
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,293
Just start with what you understand for now;

112
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,222
I’ll teach you how to pitch later.

113
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
Does my face give you ideas?

114
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:27,386
You don’t have any ideas?

115
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,920
Start with something familiar to you.

116
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,528
Don’t overthink it.

117
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,760
Maybe think about your favorite movie.

118
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,084
Okay, I think you’re overthinking this.

119
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:55,080
Anything can be an idea.

120
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,346
What are you into?

121
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,368
Games?

122
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,146
Fashion?

123
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,915
Hobbies?

124
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:01,955
People?

125
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,911
Anything.

126
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,168
What am I into?

127
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,395
This is our company profile and our directors.

128
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:39,217
If you want to work with any specific directors or producers,

129
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:40,800
please let me know, Ms. Mam.

130
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,382
If I may be honest, Ms. Jarinporn.

131
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:46,906
Please do.

132
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,093
Good directors are very hard to find these days.

133
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,951
Most of them are young and liberal.

134
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:56,586
Their work often features people wearing revealing outfits

135
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,004
and drinking alcohol.

136
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,448
I’m not comfortable with that.

137
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I completely understand.

138
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,733
If you’d like to get to know our directors and crew better,

139
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
I can arrange a meeting for you.

140
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,377
This way, you can find out what you like and don't like,

141
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:20,186
which can help prevent any issues when we start working together.

142
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,133
That’d be good.

143
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,502
I’ll set up an appointment for you then.

144
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:38,435
Excuse me, Mr. JT.

145
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,124
Mr. JT.

146
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,844
Mr. JT.

147
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,951
Mr. JT, if you’re interested, we have a marketing team for you.

148
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,164
As for the production, please refer to what I sent you.

149
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,355
What do you think?

150
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:03,831
Here’s the thing, Ms. Judy.

151
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,955
I graduated from school four years ago

152
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,653
and now I want to start a business about something I love.

153
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:10,986
You understand me, right?

154
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:12,275
Absolutely.

155
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,728
And you are?

156
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,053
I’m Ba-Mhee.

157
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:19,306
Ms. Ba-Mhee, right?

158
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:22,231
Can you take a video of me from that angle?

159
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,888
Of course, she can.

160
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,440
Please capture my whole body.

161
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,191
Hold on.

162
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:36,897
Can you take it horizontally?

163
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,728
I want the views to be captured as well.

164
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,022
‘Cause that’s my hometown, baby.

165
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,020
Yeah, sure.

166
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,177
Absolutely.

167
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,902
Perfect.

168
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,951
Looking great.

169
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,102
I think Ms. Mam is a bit conservative

170
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:09,822
but I’ve talked to her secretary who said their team is quite young.

171
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,880
So I propose we present her with two options.

172
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:18,764
As for Mr. JT, he’s open to us presenting a pitch,

173
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,853
but it seems like he already has a director in mind.

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,937
We’ll have to wait and see if we can win him over in that area.

175
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,408
Ba-Mhee,

176
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:29,964
what’s wrong?

177
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,964
Did Judy tell me everything?

178
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:34,740
How was your meeting with the clients today?

179
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:37,991
She did.

180
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,031
I can’t even remember what we’ve talked about today

181
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,622
but I have tons of the client's ice skating photos on my phone.

182
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:45,573
Who?

183
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:46,888
Who did ice skating?

184
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,022
Baimon, I’d like your advice.

185
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,697
Ms. Mam and Mr. JT’s timelines are quite similar.

186
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,511
In fact, they overlap.

187
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,746
We can’t do both.

188
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:03,973
If we have to create four boards for this, there’s no way we can finish in time.

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
We don’t have enough people.

190
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,208
How about I handle the crew?

191
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:08,675
Alright,

192
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:13,066
but set aside some budget to hire the subs too.

193
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,360
Aren’t you going to eat?

194
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,582
I’m not hungry.

195
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,022
Have you already eaten?

196
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,071
Not yet.

197
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,248
I’ve been in meetings since morning and they’re still not over.

198
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Excuse me, Jane.

199
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,440
Could you look at my ideas for the MV?

200
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,737
Is this for the MV project I assigned?

201
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,164
You had half a day to work on it and this is all you could come up with?

202
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,817
Did you include these just because you know I like this kind of movie?

203
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,315
If you can only come up with shallow ideas,

204
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,257
you might as well sit back and do nothing until it’s time to get off work.

205
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:27,991
Hello, Ja.

206
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,631
What’s wrong? A lot of work?

207
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,355
Or did you get scolded by your mentor?

208
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:37,320
Jane is always a foul-mouthed guy.

209
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,240
He has always been that way no matter how many years working with him.

210
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,186
Let me guess. You don’t have a direct background in this field.

211
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:46,346
How do you know that?

212
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:47,973
It’s obvious.

213
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,986
Jane doesn’t like any interns without a direct background in this field.

214
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,084
Why doesn’t Jane like interns from other fields?

215
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,955
People say Jane thinks they intern just for fun and not take it seriously.

216
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:04,595
They don’t know how to do anything as they don’t know the basics.

217
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:06,382
He has to teach them everything from scratch.

218
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,380
Ask him.

219
00:15:10,728 --> 00:15:12,720
Jane has issues with interns every year.

220
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,915
Who? That Assistant Director Jane?

221
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,910
Yes. He’s his mentor.

222
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,804
Two years ago, a marketing major interned as an Assistant Director.

223
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,906
After only a week, that intern cried and quit.

224
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:30,142
Yeah. Jane is difficult with everyone else in the world but afraid of the clients.

225
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,520
He’ll do anything for them.

226
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,902
He can do whatever he wants for them

227
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:36,151
but I wish he would fight for the team sometimes,

228
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,835
instead of just indulging the clients without caring about us.

229
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,222
What kind of Assistant Director does that?

230
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,080
Hello, Auntie.

231
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,924
These are the invoices from the art team.

232
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,920
You said you’d give these to me yesterday.

233
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,742
Have these been reviewed?

234
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,675
Yes.

235
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,728
Who did the review?

236
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,400
I did.

237
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,875
Did your team not teach you that these need to be reviewed by your mentor first?

238
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:27,182
The ID copy must match the one who signed.

239
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,180
This is basic knowledge.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,293
You also need to check which ones need a 3% or 5% tax deduction.

241
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,888
Whoa.

242
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,715
Were my mistakes that bad?

243
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:41,226
I’ve already reviewed them.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,275
Are you sure you looked at them correctly?

245
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,982
I’ll fix them.

246
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,266
Of course, you have to.

247
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,964
Or you can ask your intern friends to do it.

248
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,453
Someone who knows what they’re doing.

249
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,928
Okay.

250
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:25,297
When we choose the cards and write the messages ourselves,

251
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,813
the clients will notice that we pay attention

252
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,204
and feel that they’re special.

253
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,164
Choosing thank you gifts for them is easy.

254
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,111
We just need to pick what suits their brands

255
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,040
and be mindful of anything related to their competitors,

256
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:40,560
both directly and indirectly.

257
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,351
Well, Ba-Mhee, are you good at choosing gifts?

258
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,902
You know, I’m the best at that.

259
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,000
I have 18 friends.

260
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:54,577
They all like the gifts I picked for them.

261
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,200
Wow, you have 18 friends?

262
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,822
Yes, and that’s just from university.

263
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:03,760
I always know what’s trending and what to give accordingly.

264
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:12,284
Then help me think of what to buy for this client.

265
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,551
They’re a soft drink brand

266
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,600
opening a gastropub this month.

267
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,991
Hmm?

268
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,804
What’s their image?

269
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,502
Are they drinkers?

270
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,493
But since they’re opening that kind of restaurant,

271
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,711
shall we get them wine?

272
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,222
I’m good at picking wine.

273
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,377
If you think like that, our gift will end up among the pile of others’.

274
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,560
Think about it.

275
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:42,711
The client is opening a new restaurant.

276
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,742
They must have ordered countless drinks themselves already.

277
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,964
If we give them a special decoration piece instead,

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,404
it will be displayed in their restaurant forever.

279
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,400
Your idea was close.

280
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,973
Aren’t you leaving?

281
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,040
You can leave without me.

282
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,791
Don’t worry too much. He’s probably making us do this because he’s busy.

283
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,666
I’m leaving now.

284
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:08,924
Bye, Jane.

285
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,453
Bye.

286
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,662
You can go home.

287
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,751
Please go first.

288
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:40,488
I don't have a policy about interns having to leave after me,

289
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,680
so you should go home now.

290
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:16,551
Are you hungry?

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,862
No.

292
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,084
Then what was that sound?

293
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,288
A beatbox in your throat?

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
We can eat at the noodle shop up ahead.

295
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:36,300
Where is it?

296
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,306
If you’re in a hurry, you don’t have to go.

297
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,497
I can walk there and eat by myself.

298
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,537
It’s next to my condo.

299
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,360
Just a five-minute walk from here.

300
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,977
Your condo is so close.

301
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,706
I came from another city.

302
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,475
When I moved to Bangkok for work, I chose a place near my office

303
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,333
to save commuting time and get more sleep.

304
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,982
That’s great.

305
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,066
How old are you?

306
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:05,955
Watch out!

307
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,960
Why do you ask?

308
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:19,422
I’m just curious how old we usually are when we figure out what work we want to do,

309
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,973
enough to feel confident buying a place near it.

310
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,568
This place makes delicious food.

311
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,928
After the mall closes, people love coming to eat here.

312
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:51,075
Right.

313
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,662
By the way, I’m so tired after five hours of choosing gifts.

314
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,048
Honestly, do we really have to be this detailed?

315
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,084
The client is getting them for free. They’ll probably be okay with anything.

316
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:10,782
True, they’ll be okay with anything

317
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,675
but we should care about our company image.

318
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:19,991
We choose the best things and give them for free because we want them to hire us again.

319
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,253
Have there been cases where the clients didn’t like what you chose?

320
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,817
Many.

321
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,955
When I first started working, I got scolded almost every day.

322
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,093
Really?

323
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,288
You? Getting scolded?

324
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:40,133
Yes.

325
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,564
Is there anyone who doesn’t get scolded?

326
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:44,897
I don’t think so.

327
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:51,111
I don’t know, but you’re so cool, Judy.

328
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:54,640
Today, you were able to handle the clients in every scenario.

329
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:59,990
Because I have the experience, Ba-Mhee.

330
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:02,924
Any AE my age can do that.

331
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,693
That’s not true.

332
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,182
You’re so talented.

333
00:24:07,475 --> 00:24:09,555
I want to be pretty and talented like you.

334
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,084
I mean, I’m just pretty, but I’m not talented yet.

335
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:53,786
Are you okay?

336
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,457
Do you want to go to my room? I’ll get you something to eat.

337
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,275
Make yourself at home.

338
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:06,933
Here.

339
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
Thank you.

340
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:15,422
An MV needs more storytelling than a TVC.

341
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,457
It’s like making a movie.

342
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:19,450
You can’t just stick to one mood.

343
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,782
If you want to be an Assistant Director, you need to watch a lot of movies

344
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:25,422
to see how to tell stories in a way that people can understand.

345
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,853
I love watching movies, but just general ones.

346
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,417
What do you mean by general?

347
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,217
Movies where the visuals aren’t that good or cool like the ones Pie watches.

348
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:41,546
My family loves action movies.

349
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:44,302
Robots fighting each other, that kind of stuff.

350
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,013
I’m not sure if I can apply that to my work because it’s not cool.

351
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,875
Whether it’s cool or not depends on individual taste.

352
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,737
Whether it can be applied or not depends on how many ideas you can get from the movies.

353
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:03,013
You might even get cool ideas for a TVC from watching morality plays.

354
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,084
Feel free to grab any movie behind you if you want to watch it.

355
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,573
I’ll make you something easy to eat.

356
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,306
Hello?

357
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,568
Hello, Jane. Are you free the day after tomorrow?

358
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,524
The day after tomorrow?

359
00:27:46,888 --> 00:27:47,724
Yes.

360
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,671
I got the flu. I don’t think I can run the set anymore.

361
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:53,057
Can you cover for me?

362
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:54,568
Okay.

363
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,275
Send me the details.

364
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,524
Sure. I’ll send you the shot list and breakdown sheet.

365
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,288
Okay. I’ll message you when you recover.

366
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:06,500
Okay. Thank you.

367
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,466
How can I finish it in time?

368
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,248
Only one hour for the big scene?

369
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,497
There’s no way I can finish this scene in time.

370
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,031
20-minute meal break. Is that enough time?

371
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,368
Do you always have to prepare for every scenario?

372
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,142
There are always problems on set, coming from every direction—

373
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,386
cameras, lighting, costumes, location.

374
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:47,380
We need to plan for all possible solutions.

375
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:51,582
Wow. I didn’t know the scope of an Assistant Director’s role was so broad.

376
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,568
Have you heard that if the Director is the head, the Assistant Director is the two hands?

377
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,924
Actually, not only that, the Assistant Director is also the two feet.

378
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,973
Basically, they’re both the hands and feet of the Director.

379
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,484
They do anything they can.

380
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,911
Jane is difficult with everyone else in the world but afraid of the clients.

381
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,128
He’ll do anything for them.

382
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,333
He can do whatever he wants for them,

383
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:23,644
but I wish he would fight for the team sometimes,

384
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,340
instead of just indulging the clients without caring about us.

385
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:27,804
What kind of Assistant Director does that?

386
00:29:35,937 --> 00:29:37,342
And have you…

387
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,422
Is this also your way of finding references?

388
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,982
Have you encountered any problems as an Assistant Director?

389
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,822
What kind of problems? Not communicating work clearly?

390
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,742
Something like that.

391
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,408
Or are you referring to office gossip about me not caring about the crew?

392
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,462
That I only try to please the clients without considering anyone else?

393
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,377
All they can do is criticize me.

394
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I know my own intentions.

395
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,724
If you want to watch it at home, you can borrow it.

396
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:31,057
Does anyone still use a CD player these days?

397
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,608
I do.

398
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:50,850
Hey, can you put that thing under this?

399
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:53,955
Not that.

400
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,777
Are you crazy? Hold this.

401
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:08,222
Hey, get the pink coaster.

402
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,226
Put it on the table.

403
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:18,000
I’m sorry.

404
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,662
Can you eat it? I didn’t add any chilis.

405
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,435
You can add them. I can eat spicy food.

406
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,306
I won’t. I can’t eat spicy food.

407
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,991
Why are you watching this?

408
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,373
I watched this with my big sister but didn’t finish it.

409
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,370
She loves Ryan Gosling.

410
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,737
Another Ryan.

411
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
Have you watched Barbie?

412
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,768
I only watch Ryan Gosling’s in action movies

413
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:58,000
because my family only watches action movies.

414
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,902
Right, you don’t like ordinary Ryan.

415
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,946
You like action Ryan.

416
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,626
You can build on what you like for the MV.

417
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,013
It’s such a sweet love song. Can I really use a crime thriller as a reference?

418
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,817
Well, ideas can come from anywhere.

419
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,351
I got the ideas from my thesis from The Lord of The Rings movies.

420
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,253
Actually, I wanted to watch this after getting to see your room.

421
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,337
Why?

422
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,080
Am I like the Driver?

423
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,440
Kind of.

424
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,582
You’re different people day and night.

425
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,742
You’re more detail-oriented than other people think.

426
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,044
And I didn’t expect that you wouldn’t eat spicy food.

427
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,955
You’re so smart about anything not work-related.

428
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,160
I was so stressed when I first received the assignment.

429
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,160
I was afraid my ideas wouldn’t be good enough.

430
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,462
There’s no good or bad idea.

431
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,102
What matters is if it’s right for the project.

432
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,782
I shouldn’t have called your work shallow today.

433
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:33,964
That was wrong of me.

434
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,528
I’m sorry.

435
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,191
Stop overreacting or that’ll fall and mess up the carpet.

436
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,311
Eat up.

437
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:53,475
Are you serious?

438
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,057
Of course.

439
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,448
This is expensive and hard to wash.

440
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,520
I meant what you said earlier.

441
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,164
I told you that I’d apologize when I should.

442
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:08,737
Your work is not bad. It’s just not what we’re looking for.

443
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:10,730
But there’s no bad idea.

444
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:18,257
I once told Jo that I’m a bad mentor.

445
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,097
I’m not good at teaching anyone.

446
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,004
I was busy all day today

447
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,782
and took it out on you.

448
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,128
I’m really sorry.

449
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,568
By the way, how are you finding the internship so far? Do you like it?

450
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,968
You experience 3,000 emotions in a day.

451
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:48,248
At first, not really.

452
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,120
But now, I’ve started to. A lot.

453
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:18,195
Ryan.

454
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,688
Ryan.

455
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,426
It’s time for you to go home.

456
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,586
Ryan.

457
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:52,311
(Enjoy your food. Tell me when you get home.)

458
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:00,675
Hey!

459
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,475
I didn’t delete the files.

460
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:12,240
Are you tired from working like this?

461
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,897
I am, but it’s fun.

462
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,484
This is the most gifts I’ve ever bought in my life.

463
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:24,648
I’ll teach you everything you want to know.

464
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,577
Even though you didn’t want to intern here in the first place,

465
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:39,457
I want you to learn as much as possible.

466
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,786
Now I feel silly for following my boyfriend to intern.

467
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,053
You’re not silly.

468
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:49,946
It’s great that you love each other.

469
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,866
Oh, no. I forgot about him.

470
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:06,915
What?

471
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,560
Did he throw his phone away after calling me?

472
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,964
This is not funny.

473
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,448
My boyfriend is weird.

474
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,351
Weird?

475
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,546
But you follow him everywhere.

476
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:36,630
(GRADE 10 SEMESTER 1)

477
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,035
Hey.

478
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,213
Is your student ID 16?

479
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,231
I’m Ba-Mhee. My student ID is 17.

480
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:01,955
(GRADE 10 SEMESTER 2)

481
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:15,351
I don’t like sweets.

482
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,720
Me neither.

483
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,133
But they say you should buy donuts to flirt with someone you like.

484
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:33,973
But I don’t like them.

485
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:44,568
(GRADE 11 SEMESTER 2)

486
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,275
Is that Ba-Mhee who rejected you?

487
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,360
Yes.

488
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,884
She told me she likes someone else already.

489
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:00,720
What a bummer.

490
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,720
This is your chance.

491
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:04,044
Go in and talk to her.

492
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:04,800
Do you think that’s a good idea?

493
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,564
Yes.

494
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:36,506
(GRADUATION DAY)

495
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,120
Will you write on my shirt?

496
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,520
What do you want me to write?

497
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,208
Anything.

498
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,342
Okay.

499
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,195
Right here.

500
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,924
Eyes connect briefly, can people fall in love?

501
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,702
Done.

502
00:40:56,728 --> 00:40:58,933
Just a fleeting moment

503
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,928
(Anything.)

504
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:00,942
Hey.

505
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,640
Be serious.

506
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,346
Why did you write this?

507
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,186
You said to write anything.

508
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,617
You should write your feelings.

509
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,915
Or write something to scold me for having a crush on you…

510
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:21,964
Or write that I drool in my sleep.

511
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:25,644
Or that I’m lazy or talk too much.

512
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,955
Whatever. It’s up to you.

513
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,951
Write again. Here.

514
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,542
Okay.

515
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:35,022
Someone you meet on a day you feel vulnerable

516
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,328
Would it be easier and faster when you fall?

517
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:40,977
Alright.

518
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,440
Are you done?

519
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:46,284
I never really cared about love theories people say

520
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:47,680
What did you write?

521
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,946
You can read it at home.

522
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,226
Oh.

523
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:51,964
Here.

524
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,551
Until the day I met you

525
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,675
I want to see it.

526
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:58,124
(You drool in your sleep, but that’s cute.)

527
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,275
You make me want to explore

528
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:03,884
My eyes yearn to see you more

529
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:07,146
You got me lost in a distant land

530
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:10,835
Too far to reach or understand

531
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,524
(Miss you.)
No matter how near or far

532
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:25,964
I’d do anything to be there in youniverse

533
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,013
Oh, shit!

534
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,142
I’m going to get scolded!

535
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,453
(Please turn off the AC and close the door completely when you leave.)

536
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:03,546
(It’ll lock itself.)

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,377
Is it for the MV?

541
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:47,306
Yes.

542
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,084
But I didn’t come up with this myself.

543
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,924
Jane gave me advice on how to find ideas and references.

544
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:58,817
Wow. You’re Jane’s favorite junior now?

545
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,777
That’s great.

546
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,333
I wouldn’t say that.

547
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:03,060
He still scolds me.

548
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,102
But I didn’t expect him to give me advice about the MV.

549
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,960
Why did you think that?

550
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,155
Someone told me Jane doesn’t like interns who don’t have a direct background.

551
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:18,284
Oh, don’t believe them.

552
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,964
People will say whatever they want.

553
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:22,977
Jane was once an intern like you guys.

554
00:44:23,013 --> 00:44:24,071
He was really eager.

555
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:30,115
One day we had to pitch the interns’ ideas to the client and they chose the other intern’s idea.

556
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:33,253
That intern then got to help with directing.

557
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:39,128
I think Jane was hurt because that intern didn’t study in the field.

558
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,582
Later, he was poached by another company.

559
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:44,160
Jane probably didn’t like how he threw away his opportunity,

560
00:44:44,213 --> 00:44:47,955
while he was the one who really wanted it, you know?

561
00:44:48,213 --> 00:44:49,297
I think he’s still hung up on it.

562
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,022
I remember he was so upset by it.

563
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,964
I don’t think Jane has anything against you.

564
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,462
Think about it. If he didn’t care, he’d have ignored you by now.

565
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,764
He wouldn’t bother taking the time to teach and scold you.

566
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,568
Honestly, compared to any other interns in the past,

567
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,982
he likes your group a lot, even though he doesn’t say much.

568
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,630
Come on. Let’s go eat.

569
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:20,260
Why are you wearing such a big shirt though?

570
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:23,300
It has the same pattern as Jane’s. Has he seen it?

571
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,088
Ryan.

572
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:41,982
Ryan.

573
00:46:25,706 --> 00:46:27,700
Did you switch up your style today?

574
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,306
You really look like an oppa.

575
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,764
(Ryan After Work)

576
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,480
(5 Interns, Class of 24)

577
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:03,395
(Is no one talking today?)

578
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,840
(Fine…I’ll leave. This is no fun.)

579
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,524
We actually have many things in common.

580
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,626
Except for one thing—I’m not as clingy to a partner as you are.

581
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:18,266
More like your partner is clingy to you.

582
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,208
I’m single.

583
00:47:19,235 --> 00:47:20,062
Really?

584
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,204
Judy can speak four languages too.

585
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,622
I didn’t think she’d be great at everything.

586
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,168
Did she hire you to praise her?

587
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:27,955
Can you stop talking about the mentors?

588
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,497
Is this what you meant when you said he’s in love?

589
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,133
When someone loves or likes someone, it shows through their actions.

590
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:36,373
Really? He likes someone?

591
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,604
Who do you like again, Ryan?
