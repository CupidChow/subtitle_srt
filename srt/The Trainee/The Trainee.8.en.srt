1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,857
I’ll go and get some sleep too.

2
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:03,520
I’ve been up since yesterday.

3
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:04,808
Is there a lot more to finish?

4
00:00:04,844 --> 00:00:05,973
Do you want to help me?

5
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:08,782
It’s my anniversary with Ba-Mhee this Saturday.

6
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,466
Just tell him it’s your anniversary this Saturday.

7
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,460
No one can remember every day in their lives.

8
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:15,040
Judy can.

9
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:17,610
Tae, I made you a sandwich.

10
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,462
Shall we eat it together?

11
00:00:18,488 --> 00:00:19,973
Leave it there. I’ll eat it later.

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,991
Don’t just take care of someone else.

13
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,511
Take care of yourself too.

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,733
Are you really single?

15
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:26,835
Yes.

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,524
You’re pretty

17
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:29,564
and nice.

18
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:31,822
Any man who walks by looks at you.

19
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,386
I don’t like men.

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,311
Where did you get this bottle?

21
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:49,662
The director’s room.

22
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:51,848
Who took the bottle from behind my desk to do the test?

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
If you’re not taking your job seriously, just stay home.

24
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,644
Don’t come and make us feel bad every day.

25
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:58,817
Just go wherever you want.

26
00:00:58,853 --> 00:00:59,857
I’m not leaving.

27
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,075
I like this job.

28
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,000
I like it here.

29
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,342
And I like you.

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,440
SATURDAY MORNING

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,888
I like this job.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,288
I like it here.

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,715
And I like you.

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,386
Wake up.

35
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,195
An!

36
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:02,693
Come down and help me.

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,008
We have a lot of clients.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,844
Okay.

39
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,395
One,

40
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:34,860
two, three.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,675
Okay.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,822
One.

43
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,168
One more time.

44
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,142
Okay, done.

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,448
Do I look handsome?

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,217
Can I see?

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,235
Please wait for your photos downstairs.

48
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:05,582
Alright.

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,417
I only confessed my feelings. Why does he have to haunt me?

50
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,071
Pull yourself together.

51
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,520
Pull yourself together, Ryan.

52
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,711
Who do you have feelings for?

53
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,897
Why are you shocked? It’s me.

54
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,906
You’ve seen me since primary school. Aren’t you used to it by now?

55
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,711
Come on.

56
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,080
So, who did you confess your feelings to?

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,577
Are you crazy? I was just thinking about the script for my work.

58
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,160
Okay.

59
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,168
Tell me about the script.

60
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,648
Well, it’s about

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,471
having a crush on someone at the office

62
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,066
and confessing your feelings,

63
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,466
but not knowing what to do next since you have to see each other every day.

64
00:03:59,511 --> 00:03:59,982
Who do you have feelings for?

65
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,093
I have feelings for…

66
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,160
In the script, right?

67
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,497
It’s a senior at the office.

68
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:11,235
I already told you. Why are you asking so many questions?

69
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,346
I already told you.

70
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:12,746
EP 8: NEW PAIR OF SHOES

71
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:13,573
Okay.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,728
I won’t ask anymore.

73
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,720
Good. Help me choose the photos.

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,653
(127 Missed Calls)

75

(Let’s not stay mad for this long.)
(Please call me back, Tae.)

(I’m sorry about last night, Judy.)

79
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:55,226
(I’m sorry for kissing you.)

80
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:01,502
What should I worry about first?

81
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:26,604
(11:30 a.m. Restaurant Reservation)

82
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,813
Hello. What’s up?

83
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,555
Where are you?

84
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,622
So yummy.

85
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:54,417
The shrimp is good too.

86
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,013
Right?

87
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:55,822
Yeah.

88
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,653
Excuse me.

89
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:06,580
Are the French fries included in the course?

90
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,364
Can I have one more?

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,071
I’d like some sauce too, please.

92
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,173
Do you want some sauce?

93
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:12,960
What kind of sauce do you want?

94
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,071
Can we get one tomato sauce and one mayonnaise, please?

95
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,404
What’s wrong with Tae?

96
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,400
He looks like he just got dumped.

97
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,613
Do I like Judy?

98
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,453
Do you really have a crush on Judy?

99
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,697
Piping hot.

100
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:15,226
Babe, are you in there?

101
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,386
Please open the door.

102
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:46,595
(GRANDMA HONG’S NOODLE SHOP)

103
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:51,875
Hey, I thought you went to see Tae.

104
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:53,137
Why are you back so early?

105
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,031
He’s not home, Dad.

106
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,155
Ba-Mhee.

107
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,933
Judy.

108
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,017
I was visiting our client in this neighborhood.

109
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,240
She recommended this place.

110
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,982
When I told her the owner was the intern who’s good at singing,

111
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,980
she was really shocked.

112
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,133
Judy.

113
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:48,595
Hmm?

114
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,306
About last night,

115
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,173
I’m sorry.

116
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,448
I was really drunk.

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,697
Ba-Mhee, why are you apologizing to me?

118
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,200
I’m not mad at you.

119
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,768
If you want to apologize, you should do it to your boyfriend.

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
I know you’re not into me like that.

121
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,755
Wait, no.

122
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,973
Actually, you’ve caused me some damage too.

123
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,782
You must take responsibility.

124
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,217
What do you want me to do?

125
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,650
Quit the internship?

126
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,991
It’s not enough.

127
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,057
This bowl is not enough.

128
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,950
Treat me to two more.

129
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,431
Order yours too and let’s eat together.

130
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:24,791
Only then, I’ll stop being mad at you.

131
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:33,742
Okay.

132
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,604
Dad!

133
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,608
Two more of this and two of the usual for me.

134
00:12:39,644 --> 00:12:40,720
Okay. Just a moment.

135
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,564
You didn’t even finish this.

136
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,608
Well, I don’t like meatballs.

137
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,302
Freaking good.

138
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,395
See? I told you we needed to order this at this kind of place.

139
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:19,066
Tae, will you stop being miserable already?

140
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:21,404
We’ve eaten almost everything in this place.

141
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,288
Have you taken a single bite?

142
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,760
At least you guys made the most of this meal.

143
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,890
My reservation didn’t go to waste.

144
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,213
Eat with us.

145
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,648
Excuse me.

146
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,337
One more.

147
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,768
I don’t know what you’ve been through, Tae.

148
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,773
You can be disappointed and sad

149
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,640
but these delicious dishes didn’t do anything wrong.

150
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,226
Just eat.

151
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,702
At least, you won’t be disappointed with the french fries.

152
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:19,813
Okay.

153
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,195
Why did you move it? I placed it nicely.

154
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,964
I just wanted to make it easy for Tae to grab the fries.

155
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,604
Placing it at this angle was already good.

156
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,826
I wanted to put it like this so it’s easy for Tae.

157
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,302
This is abstract art.

158
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:35,973
What art? Stop it.

159
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:37,786
- You don’t work in art. You know nothing.
- Just stop.

160
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,244
I know you’re hurting badly.

161
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I don’t know how to help you.

162
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,088
If you want me to replace your girl,

163
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,275
I’m afraid I can’t.

164
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,128
I’ll stick with you this weekend,

165
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,253
whether that helps or not.

166
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,688
Come on. Let’s eat.

167
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,084
Eat up.

168
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,911
MONDAY MORNING

169
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,675
All good with pack shots, Uncle Moo?

170
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,680
Okay.

171
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Jane, can you take the blocking position?

172
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:49,377
Okay.

173
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,370
Pie, don’t forget the lighting cue.

174
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,102
Wear the suit so we can check the real color.

175
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,320
I need two people to play the main leads.

176
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,964
Ryan, take the blocking position.

177
00:16:16,115 --> 00:16:16,542
Here.

178
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,964
Do the main leads hate each other?

179
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,266
Move closer to each other.

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,382
Female lead, feed him the snack.

181
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,946
Male lead, lean forward to bite it.

182
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,648
Get closer, Jane.

183
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:35,777
Closer.

184
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:38,746
Closer.

185
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:45,170
Jane, this is a romantic scene.

186
00:17:45,324 --> 00:17:46,408
Get closer.

187
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,586
Closer.

188
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,964
Okay. Cue the lighting.

189
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:57,502
Cue.

190
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:08,871
Closer.

191
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay. Cut.

192
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:22,871
That’s what we’re looking for.

193
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,142
Pah, are you bringing props to Uncle Moo on the set?

194
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,671
Come here first.

195
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,053
Accounting called me over

196
00:18:44,097 --> 00:18:46,382
and complained about the many mistakes in the invoices you prepared.

197
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,840
How did that happen?

198
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:51,822
Come on. I’m dumb.

199
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,820
Let me carry stuff instead.

200
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,582
Don’t make excuses.

201
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,173
Redo the invoices.

202
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,146
I’ll handle the props.

203
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,648
You can go to the set later.

204
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:01,466
Alright.

205
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,831
Cut.

206
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,946
Very good. Isn’t that good?

207
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,671
It’s good to go for me.

208
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:21,040
Judy, please check with the client.

209
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,364
Okay. The client needs a moment to watch the playback.

210
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,800
One playback, please.

211
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,924
What’s up, female lead?

212
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
I wanted to say hi since I saw you on the monitor doing your blocking.

213
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,497
Why didn’t you tell me this is your company?

214
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,804
How could I have known that this production team is from your company?

215
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,871
I’m so happy to be working with my friend.

216
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,764
What a small world.

217
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,857
Is that everyone on your team?

218
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:56,488
Yeah.

219
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,266
Oh.

220
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:01,386
Which one did you confess your feelings to?

221
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,315
Ryan, get the extras here.

222
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,880
Ms. Judy.

223
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:27,235
Yes?

224
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:31,004
I want to eat congee from the shop in Bangrak, but I don’t know if it’s still open.

225
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,737
Okay, let me check for you.

226
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,391
Ba-Mhee.

227
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,324
It’s open.

228
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,133
What would you like? I’ll place the order for you right away.

229
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:38,933
Great.

230
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:41,057
Let me ask my team to add what we want.

231
00:20:41,093 --> 00:20:41,715
Of course.

232
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:49,404
Judy.

233
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:49,973
Hmm?

234
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,435
You asked them to deliver coffee at 10 a.m., right?

235
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:55,173
Yes. I forgot.

236
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,817
It’s okay. I already asked the support services team to get it for us.

237
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,955
There they are.

238
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,484
This way, please.

239
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:05,040
Thank you.

240
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,804
I ordered coffee for you.

241
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,977
Thank you.

242
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,031
Here’s your green tea.

243
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
I remember you don’t drink coffee.

244
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:19,680
Thank you.

245
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,137
Done.

246
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,231
Thank you.

247
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,973
(Can you hear me out, Tae?)
(Please call me back.)
(I was really drunk.)
(Today is our anniversary, do you remember?)
(Let’s not stay mad for this long.)
(Please call me back, Tae.)

248
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,520
Why am I so bad at math?

249
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,640
I should’ve worked harder in secondary school.

250
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,608
Oh, who taught you last time?

251
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,600
Ba-Mhee helped me.

252
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,075
Did you two not talk at all over the weekend?

253
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,431
What do you want me to talk about?

254
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,448
You saw what I saw, didn’t you?

255
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,128
You’re right.

256
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,444
A ghost must have possessed Ba-Mhee, I think.

257
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,511
Hey, what are these photos?

258
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:04,480
They look beautiful.

259
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,671
Do you want to visit these places?

260
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
Ba-Mhee does.

261
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,604
You know what? At first, I was so angry.

262
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:32,986
But over the last couples of days, I’ve been reflecting on myself

263
00:23:33,306 --> 00:23:34,980
and realized that she’s changed

264
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,635
because of me.

265
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:44,471
Why do you think that?

266
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:51,448
I don’t know.

267
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:56,835
It seemed like her life was all about me.

268
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,928
I neglected her in many ways.

269
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,248
If I’m not the only one in her life anymore,

270
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,742
it’s all my fault, isn’t it?

271
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,266
I’m okay.

272
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,333
Go cry in there.

273
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,524
Are you crazy?

274
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,204
I’m not going to cry.

275
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,702
I can see from Mars that you’re not okay.

276
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,551
Go cry.

277
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:11,555
Come on.

278
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:12,355
Go.

279
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,191
Go.

280
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:14,435
Just a bit.

281
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,395
No.

282
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:16,533
I’m not going to cry.

283
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:17,635
I’m serious.

284
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,546
I’m okay.

285
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,373
This tells you whether it’s day or night

286
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,350
and this tells you which actors are needed.

287
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,435
Correct.

288
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:14,791
I almost forgot you study communication arts like the crew here.

289
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,302
Not really.

290
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:18,684
I study advertising. I’m working on the client side.

291
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,208
All the sets I’ve been on always wrap late

292
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:22,915
but this one seems so chill.

293
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,422
The Assistant Director must be talented.

294
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,240
Yes, Jane is talented but very strict.

295
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,240
Ryan, come here.

296
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,942
Speak of the devil.

297
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:35,751
Yeah.

298
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:39,902
- Careful.
- Ryan, are you coming yet?

299
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,297
Go get the actors.

300
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,040
Got it.

301
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:45,982
Bye.

302
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,980
Ryan, go get the actors.

303
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,733
Got it.

304
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,062
Are you almost done?

305
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:56,506
Ryan, get the extras in the frame.

306
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,920
Got it.

307
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,293
Ryan, come do blocking instead of the actors.

308
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:03,324
Got it.

309
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:04,817
Ryan, get the product shots.

310
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:06,088
The client wants to see them. Hurry.

311
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,155
Got it.

312
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,964
Ryan, we can’t start filming due to the noise. Didn’t you hear it?

313
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,755
Got it.

314
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:13,422
Ryan, come here already.

315
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,275
Here you go.

316
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,506
Hey.

317
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,160
Stop.

318
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:19,395
Please stop here.

319
00:27:19,422 --> 00:27:20,817
Could you turn off your engines?

320
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:23,804
Thank you.

321
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,671
Can we go yet? I have something to do.

322
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,800
Just a moment, please.

323
00:27:30,835 --> 00:27:31,964
Hurry up.

324
00:27:32,008 --> 00:27:33,377
Hurry up.

325
00:27:34,106 --> 00:27:34,942
Okay, cut.

326
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,088
You can let the motorbikes go.

327
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,004
You may go now.

328
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:37,857
Thank you.

329
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:38,666
I’m sorry.

330
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:39,751
What’s wrong with him?

331
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,750
Ryan, come to the front of the set.

332
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:47,395
Got it.

333
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:53,390
Do you think Jane is acting weird, Ryan?

334
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,066
He’s so strict today.

335
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,306
Yeah, even the client asked who Ryan is because he keeps getting called so much.

336
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,360
Did you do something to upset him?

337
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,968
And I like you.

338
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,955
Pah.

339
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:13,724
Excuse me.

340
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,022
Hey, guys.

341
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:20,222
Clearly not. It’s like we’re in a military camp today.

342
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,084
What’s up, lover girl?

343
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,871
How can I look at her the same way?

344
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,431
I feel so bad for Tae.

345
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,924
How’s it going?

346
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,631
You were chilling this morning, but suddenly your mentor turned strict.

347
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,520
Jane's mood keeps going up and down today.

348
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,013
I don’t understand.

349
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,204
Believe me.

350
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,440
In less than 5 minutes of talking with me, he’s going to call for you again.

351
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:34,515
Yeah.

352
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,880
I don’t know what’s going on today.

353
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,302
My friends…

354
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:39,226
Ryan, can I have the product shots?

355
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:40,888
Damn.

356
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,100
Did he stick something to your body?

357
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:48,977
Wait.

358
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,715
Your shoelaces are loose.

359
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,120
Do you want to wear my shoes instead?

360
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,502
You’ll get scolded for running with laces coming off like that.

361
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:54,453
Come here.

362
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,933
I have another pair in my car.

363
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,955
The client asked me to get the product shots.

364
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,591
Which ones? I don’t know.

365
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:18,613
I just got here.

366
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,813
Can you help check? We need them.

367
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,617
You have to wait. The seniors in my team are eating now.

368
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:26,773
When they’re done, I’ll ask them for you.

369
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,240
Can’t you ask them now?

370
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,635
The client wants to see them.

371
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,986
What’s so hard to understand?

372
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:40,980
They’re eating right now.

373
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,973
Let me run and ask them.

374
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,706
It’s not your job, Ryan.

375
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,040
This is lunch break.

376
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,840
What’s the rush to see them now?

377
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,622
If they want to see them so much, the AE should prepare them herself.

378
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,177
Can you not pick a fight with me?

379
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,964
I’m here to talk about work.

380
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,084
I’m talking about work.

381
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,626
I think not. You’re being sarcastic with me.

382
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:11,620
Stay out of other people’s business.

383
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,853
You’re right.

384
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,426
I’m nosy.

385
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,951
I happened to know your boyfriend didn’t sleep

386
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:18,808
because he wanted to spend time with you on your anniversary.

387
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,857
I happened to be with him when he was crying his eyes out.

388
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:25,822
I happened to see where you went when he was doing everything for you.

389
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,262
I’ll ask Jane about the product shots.

390
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:39,653
Let’s go, Ba-Mhee.

391
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,431
Okay, hold up the products.

392
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,662
Stand back-to-back.

393
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,582
Cut.

394
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,604
That’s good to go.

395
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:06,835
Let’s have a 30-minute meal break.

396
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,537
The actors are done. You can let them leave, Pie.

397
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,977
After eating, we’re going to shoot the pack shots.

398
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:17,070
Ryan, follow me.

399
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,293
Okay.

400
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,280
You want to talk about how I showed you the product shots late, don’t you?

401
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:50,337
No, I talked to Moo and the client together before you gave them to me.

402
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,568
Why didn’t you pay attention to work at all today?

403
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,320
Huh?

404
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,666
Me?

405
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,942
I ran around doing the tasks you assigned all day.

406
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,693
If I hadn’t radioed you, you’d have chatted with that client all day.

407
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,248
That didn’t affect my work.

408
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:19,760
I should be asking what’s wrong with you.

409
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,644
Me?

410
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,173
Yes.

411
00:33:23,591 --> 00:33:24,577
Something is wrong with you.

412
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,364
My friends kept fighting, my work was chaotic,

413
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:30,360
and it also felt like you were bullying me all day.

414
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,013
Do you think that just because I confessed my feelings for you,

415
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,235
you can be mean to me however you want?

416
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,146
When you said you liked me, in what way did you mean?

417
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:40,471
Or were you just rambling?

418
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,266
Do you think you can just casually say you like someone?

419
00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:06,800
SATURDAY MORNING

420
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,022
Yeah, I don’t think we can finish filming in time.

421
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:36,000
We need to talk to…

422
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,586
Ryan!

423
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,168
I like you!

424
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,577
It’s nothing.

425
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:49,340
Male lead, lean forward to bite it.

426
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,680
Jane, this is a romantic scene.

427
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,844
Get closer.

428
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,497
Okay, cut.

429
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:04,240
Your ear is so red, Jane. Is it hot in there?

430
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:15,991
Ryan, go get the actors.

431
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,751
Ryan, come here.

432
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,795
Careful.

433
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,088
Ryan, are you coming yet?

434
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:31,093
Go get the actors.

435
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,280
Ryan, get the extras in the frame.

436
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:33,911
Got it.

437
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:35,457
Ryan, come do blocking instead of the actors.

438
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:35,911
Got it.

439
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,520
Ryan, we can’t start filming due to the noise. Didn’t you hear it?

440
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:38,008
Got it.

441
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:38,515
Ryan!

442
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,680
Ryan!

443
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,524
In less than 5 minutes, he’s going to call for you again.

444
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,520
Ryan, get the product shots.

445
00:36:06,711 --> 00:36:07,706
What’s in that bag?

446
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,684
Check it out.

447
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,431
Are you going to change your shoes?

448
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,430
Do you think I can wear that size?

449
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,471
Whose size is it, really?

450
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,813
But if you already got another pair, it’s fine.

451
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,164
Wait.

452
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,164
He’s my friend.

453
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,084
His name is Tao-hu.

454
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:21,650
He's been my best friend since secondary school.

455
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,040
Just wanted to let you know, in case he’s the reason you’ve been mad at me all day.

456
00:37:31,413 --> 00:37:32,800
Don’t get ahead of yourself.

457
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,800
Thank you, Jane.

458
00:38:35,884 --> 00:38:36,453
Here.

459
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,924
Oh, I was just craving fried meatballs today.

460
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,795
I thought you were going to say you’d eat them later.

461
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,546
Here, do you want some?

462
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,582
They’re still hot.

463
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,982
Have a seat.

464
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,613
They really are hot.

465
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,610
They’re delicious, aren’t they?

466
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,164
Yeah.

467
00:39:53,084 --> 00:39:55,502
(DON’T FORGET TO DRINK 8 GLASSES OF WATER!!)

468
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:58,826
Oh, I need to drink water at 8 p.m.

469
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,488
Without you to remind me, how would I live?

470
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,480
I’m sorry.

471
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,351
It’s okay.

472
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,151
I understand.

473
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,466
You know, I really want to be mad at you,

474
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,871
but I can’t lie to myself.

475
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,266
Things got this messy because of me.

476
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,422
I’m the one who didn’t take care of you well enough.

477
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,270
That’s why everything turned out this way.

478
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,271
You must be tired already.

479
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:54,320
You know,

480
00:41:56,115 --> 00:42:04,177
all this time I thought I was in the way of your life.

481
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,520
I waited for you to give me attention.

482
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,906
I waited for you to take care of my feelings for a change.

483
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,173
I waited for you to eat the sandwiches I made.

484
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,226
You know,

485
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:38,160
your 'soon' felt so long for the one who was waiting like me.

486
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,435
So,

487
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,240
should we end this?

488
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,915
I’m sorry.

489
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,200
It’s okay, Ba-Mhee.

490
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,644
It’s okay.

491
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,004
Stop blaming yourself.

492
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,973
When you finish your vitamins, buy more from the pharmacy.

493
00:44:58,497 --> 00:45:00,490
And don’t get sick.

494
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,093
Get a lot of sleep.

495
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:04,382
Got it?

496
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,973
I know.

497
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,377
You can go.

498
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:28,951
Ba-Mhee.

499
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,031
Your eyes are swollen like a frog’s.

500
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,106
(Ryan After Work)

501
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,946
(Jane, thank you for the shoes.)

502
00:46:57,955 --> 00:46:59,146
(Thank you.)

503
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,635
(It’s okay. Now you don’t have to swap shoes with anyone again.)

504
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:06,373
(Are you jealous?)

505
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,160
(Yeah, I’ll wear them every day.)

506
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:13,297
((Awkward) smile)

507
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,293
Tae stepped away for you.

508
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:17,395
I know I’m in the wrong,

509
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:20,595
but do you know how hard I’ve tried all this time?

510
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:24,248
You know, Tae never paid me much attention.

511
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,817
Nine, what brings you here?

512
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,337
I have some business to attend to.

513
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,342
Let’s grab something to eat together.

514
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,408
I want to talk with you.

515
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,311
Baimon, why do they seem so close?
