1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,730
If you're smart,

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,560
you'll come clean right now.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,090
You're asking for trouble.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,520
You're stalling again.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,800
Brother Chu.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,520
Xiaoqi.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,800
Very well,

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
this old man will stretch his muscles

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,780
and make you admit defeat.

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,580
Brother Liang,

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,560
Xiaoqi has already informed Brother Chu

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,039
to follow the carriage

13
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,400
heading north of the city.

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
You should go now,

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,759
I'll handle things here.

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,479
Alright, be careful,

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,100
and find us when the Imperial Guards arrive.

18
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,200
Lin Feng,

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,240
you won't be able to intercept this shipment today.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
Is that so?

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,280
So confident.

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,160
If I don't disappoint you,

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,090
I'd be letting down your boasting.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
Brother Chu,

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,600
it's empty.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,320
Something feels wrong.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,600
What's wrong?

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
Yin Qingmo hasn't shown up yet,

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,960
and Lin Feng's carriage must be a decoy too.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,120
No,

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
that's not it, Ah Liang.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
Go find out where Yin Qingmo is,

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
we must be missing something.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,040
Alright, leave it to me,

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,840
you go after Lin Feng,

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
I'll let you know immediately if I find anything.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,040
Good.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,760
Let's see how you'll escape now.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,680
Damn it.

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,370
Another poisoning.

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,760
It's fake.

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,290
Even the last carriage is fake.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
All four carriages are fake,

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
how is that possible?

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Not entirely.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,660
One of them has a small amount of iron ore.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
A diversion?

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,610
What exactly did Li Haifeng do?

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,920
Did you see me?

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,480
Did you see Yin Qingmo?

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,680
No,

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,720
that's why I find it strange too.

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,160
Brother Chu,

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
we found it.

55
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,320
Brother Liang says

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,520
the real goods are in the western woods.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,600
Let's go.

58
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,000
She's been by his side all along.

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,040
Don't lose your composure,

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,840
our objective remains the same.

61
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,399
Yin Qingmo,

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
do you really want to become our enemy

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
for his sake?

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,360
I believe you'll make a wise choice.

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,000
Look,

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,320
isn't Ping'an adorable?

67
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,880
I have no choice.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
Kill them.

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,880
I know you don't really want to fight me.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
That doesn't matter.

71
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
I must save my child.

72
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Mother, stop fighting.

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
I'm so scared.

74
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,210
You still have a chance.

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,250
Take your child and leave quickly.

76
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,480
Are you worried about the poison in your child?

77
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't worry.

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,560
I will definitely

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,490
get the antidote before tomorrow.

80
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,360
How can I trust you?

81
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
I am Jurchen.

82
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,250
That cannot be changed.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Whether Jurchen

84
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
or Han,

85
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,800
no one likes war and killing.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
You're just an ordinary person now.

87
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,400
You have family who needs you.

88
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,320
It's your mind that's been poisoned.

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't you want peace?

90
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,570
Don't you want to live a peaceful life?

91
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,060
You've already died once.

92
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,360
Now you have a fresh start.

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,159
You haven't robbed or killed anyone again.

94
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,250
You have the right to be reborn.

95
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
Go live a peaceful and happy life.

96
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
You think the two of you

97
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,200
can stop me?

98
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
There's no escape for you today.

99
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Yin Qingmo,

100
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,600
if you betray me,

101
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

102
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Father.

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Lin Feng.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,450
Brother Lin.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
Yin Qingmo.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
You dare betray the Jurchen people.

107
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,659
I have never betrayed our people.

108
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
The one I betrayed

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,640
was you.

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,200
You use the pretext of restoring our people's power,

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,440
but it's actually just for your

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,400
pathetic and ridiculous power-hungry ambitions,

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,260
sacrificing innocent civilians

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,360
and children's lives

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,840
to achieve your own goals.

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,880
Li Haifeng,

117
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,680
you're ruthless and stubborn,

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
you've caused the death of our people around you,

119
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,320
you're the one who betrayed the Jurchen,

120
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,380
you don't deserve to lead our people.

121
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,600
You dare claim you're more noble than me?

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,080
You yourself are someone who betrays your own family.

123
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,920
Isn't it all for that child?

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,800
I'll grant your wish right now.

125
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,840
Li Haifeng!

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,200
If you dare touch that antidote,

127
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,520
I will never let you get away with it.

128
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Never let me get away?

129
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,640
I want you to watch

130
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,200
as this antidote slips through your fingers

131
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,679
and feel complete despair.

132
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,400
No!

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,440
Li Haifeng!

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
Li Haifeng!

135
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,160
I'll make sure you die a horrible death!

136
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Take down the Golden Blade Clan,

137
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
don't let anyone escape.

138
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,450
Don't be afraid.

139
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,800
Sir.

140
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,560
You should go back first,

141
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,920
quickly tend to your wounds,

142
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
leave the cleanup to us.

143
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,560
Take this one away.

144
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,200
Ping'an.

145
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
Father, Ping'an.

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,440
Hurry up.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Hero Chu.

148
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
This is the antidote prepared by the young master himself,

149
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
it will certainly help your family

150
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,360
overcome the poison and escape danger.

151
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,840
Thank you, Miss Ruoting.

152
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,160
I will remember this kindness,

153
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
if you ever need anything from me in the future,

154
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
I will certainly help with all my might.

155
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Hero Chu, you're too kind.

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
I've only done

157
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
what little I could.

158
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
Then I won't stay any longer,

159
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
I must hurry to save them.

160
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,090
Sister-in-law,

161
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
this medicine was prepared by the Medicine Immortal himself,

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,400
it will definitely cure Ping'an's poisoning.

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Ping'an, wake up.

164
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,040
Ping'an.

165
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,040
Ping'an, you're awake.

166
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,760
Ping'an.

167
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
Ping'an, you're finally awake.

168
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm so hungry,

169
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
I want to eat.

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
Alright,

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,280
mother will go make

172
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,140
your favorite wontons right now.

173
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,490
Brother Chu.

174
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,480
We're truly grateful for the antidote you brought

175
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,540
that saved Ping'an

176
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,440
and saved our entire family.

177
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,240
I, Lin Feng, cannot thank you enough.

178
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,370
Brother Lin,

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,800
no need for such formality.

180
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,880
If you really want to thank someone,

181
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,280
you should thank Miss Zhao and Master Ling.

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,780
I'll definitely pay them a personal visit another day.

183
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,850
Brother Chu,

184
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,240
how's your wound?

185
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Is it serious? Do you need it bandaged?

186
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
No need, no need. It's not serious.

187
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,520
I've already dressed it.

188
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,640
That's good.

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Master Chu.

190
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Master Chu, please stay for dinner.

191
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,320
Sister-in-law,

192
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280
I won't stay for dinner.

193
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,610
I have some matters to attend to back home.

194
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,720
Goodbye.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,680
My dear,

196
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
no matter what storms rage outside,

197
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,330
I will protect you all with my life.

198
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,240
My love,

199
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm truly grateful to you.

200
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Thank you for giving me

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,840
a chance to start over.

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,020
You've made me realize

203
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
that I too can live a happy life.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,640
Qingmo,

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,580
you don't need to thank me.

206
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,360
You deserve this happiness.

207
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,380
For the road ahead,

208
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,160
let's walk side by side

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,370
and protect our home together.

210
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,520
It hurts.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,240
Brother Chu.

212
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
We agreed

213
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,280
that before our revenge is complete,

214
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,560
you must protect yourself

215
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,020
and stay out of harm's way.

216
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,380
I don't oppose your heroic deeds,

217
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,200
but you need to weigh what's more important.

218
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,760
I know,

219
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
don't you trust me by now?

220
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,320
When have I ever broken

221
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,880
a promise to my little brother and sister?

222
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,640
Next time I'll be extra careful,

223
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
and if I encounter danger again,

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,160
I'll keep my distance.

225
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Brother Chu.

226
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Brother Chu.

227
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
How did you get hurt?

228
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,960
Is it serious?

229
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,360
Don't touch me,

230
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,840
don't.

231
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,400
What's wrong?

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,930
It's not serious as long as you don't touch me.

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,200
A-Liang.

234
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,360
Why are you scaring Ji'an?

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
I didn't say anything,

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,920
don't blame me.

237
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,680
It wasn't Brother A-Liang who told me,

238
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,240
it was Miss Ruoting.

239
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
She said you were hurt

240
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
and bought some things for me to bring back.

241
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,880
When I heard you were hurt, I was terrified,

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,960
my head was spinning,

243
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,840
I couldn't think straight,

244
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
so I rushed back immediately,

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,800
I just...

246
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,020
Good thing she brought all these supplies back.

247
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,840
Thank you, honored guests, for visiting our art studio.

248
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,200
Today is my Hanxiu's graduation ceremony

249
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,360
and I invite you all to appreciate her artwork.

250
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,640
Later, we will be selling Hanxiu's paintings

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,260
to the highest bidder.

252
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,120
I hope everyone will actively participate

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,320
in this artistic celebration.

254
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Wonderful!

255
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,880
Good, this is truly impressive.

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,600
Indeed.

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
It was you.

258
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
You killed me.

259
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,490
Pay with your lives.

260
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,320
I'll make you pay with your lives.

261
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,000
You will pay for what you've done.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,260
What's wrong with her?

263
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,200
Quick, get someone to take her away!

264
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,880
Lanxin.

265
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
What's happening to you?

266
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
Calm down.

267
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,050
Don't be afraid.

268
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,400
What grievances do you have?

269
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,920
We can talk this through.

270
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm going to kill you.

271
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,090
I will end your life.

272
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Give me back my life!

273
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,200
Return my life to me!

274
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,040
Give me back what you took!
