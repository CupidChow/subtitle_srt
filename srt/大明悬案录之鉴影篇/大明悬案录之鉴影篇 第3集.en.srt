1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,440
Indeed, quite interesting.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,680
But this Paris polyphylla,

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,840
is it easy to collect?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,720
I've heard that when collecting it,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
you need some luck,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,560
because it grows in damp, deep mountains,

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,760
making it extremely difficult to find.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,360
Brother Chu, you even know about this.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,680
You're truly knowledgeable.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,740
Come, Brother Chu,

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,560
I toast to you.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,890
Brother Lin.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
That bodhi fruit waist pendant of yours

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,480
is quite unique.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,960
Where did you find it?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I rarely see

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
such exquisite craftsmanship.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,080
My dear,

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,120
you haven't been drinking,

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,320
why do you seem drunk?

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,650
Brother Lin.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,400
Your waist pendant is truly a fine piece.

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,370
Only the wealthy or noble could wear such an item.

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,960
It seems you're a hidden master.

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Brother Chu, you jest.

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,640
It was merely made by a friend,

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,000
originally as a token of love for my wife.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,360
My dear,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,800
where is your pendant?

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,730
Bring it out too.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
I just remembered

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
a few days ago when Mrs. Wang and I were moving vegetables

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,729
I accidentally cut myself.

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,280
I've been quite busy these past couple of days

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,360
so I put it away

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
with my clothes in the storage room.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,360
I'll wear it again after things settle down.

38
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,440
You put it away?

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,170
You haven't taken it off once in six years.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
I was afraid of losing it.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,479
You two enjoy your drinks

42
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,880
while I check on Ping'an.

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Brother Chu

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
come, let's drink.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,160
Mrs. Lin

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,120
my hand

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,780
got hurt last night while I was washing clothes.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,400
Mrs. Wang

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,480
please rest for a while

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,810
I can carry this myself.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Lin.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
Your secret

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
doesn't matter anymore.

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,940
Lin asked me to help you

55
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm not too late, am I?

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
My husband told me before he left

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
you've arrived just in time.

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,920
Mrs. Wang

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
my husband needs me for something

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
could you please watch the stall for me

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,570
while I go back home?

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
If there's something at home, you should hurry

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll take care of everything here.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,400
Thank you.

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Go quickly.

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,020
Lin Feng doesn't know your secret

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,280
but do you know

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,210
who he really is?

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,690
What do you mean?

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,880
Is Lin Feng keeping secrets from me too?

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm also curious

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,640
what game you two are playing.

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,600
Lin Feng is no ordinary man

74
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,440
he's the Chief Officer of the Shenwu Guard in Tongzhou

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,500
currently investigating the iron ore smuggling case.

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,720
Shi Jia from the blacksmith shop

77
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,000
is an important figure in a secret organization

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
did you know that?

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,490
The Shenwu Guard...

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,200
Smuggling iron ore

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,400
though it violates imperial interests

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,930
isn't such a serious matter

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,160
why make such a big fuss about it?

84
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
The Shenwu Guard is our dynasty's military garrison

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
tasked with protecting the safety of Tongzhou region

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
and preventing foreign invasions.

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,760
Tongzhou, as a crucial transportation hub

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
and strategic location,

89
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
holds great military significance.

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,040
The Shenwu Guard must constantly patrol and remain vigilant,

91
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,570
staying alert at all times.

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,760
Some people, to make a living,

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,080
sell small amounts of iron ore for some silver,

94
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,740
which isn't a serious matter.

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,220
But smuggling large quantities of refined iron ore

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,279
and sulfur ore,

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
suggests their purpose

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,240
is not simply to earn some scattered silver

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
to get rich.

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,010
Why are you telling me all this?

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,650
I don't understand.

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,960
Besides,

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,120
how do you know so much?

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,500
My husband couldn't have told you these things.

105
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Could you and Lin Feng have met that night?

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,250
He was one of the officials.

107
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
I was in a hurry to leave that day,

108
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,040
didn't want to cause trouble,

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,640
and didn't see them clearly.

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
But you,

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,240
I saw you very clearly.

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Madam,

113
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,400
I know you don't want innocent people to die.

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,460
You must know more about this matter.

115
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,410
I need your help for me and Brother Lin.

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
The mastermind behind this,

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,740
who needs large quantities of refined iron and sulfur ore,

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
what exactly is he planning?

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,100
Who are you really?

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Who sent you?

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,580
What's your true purpose?

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Madam,

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
you can trust me.

124
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm not your enemy,

125
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
and I'll keep your secrets.

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,680
I was forced into this case,

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
and I need to prove my innocence.

128
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
But I don't want to turn you in.

129
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,120
However, if more

130
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
innocent lives are at stake,

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
I ask you

132
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,010
to consider carefully.

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,640
I have no other purpose

134
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,000
than to find the mastermind, help Brother Lin solve the case,

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,530
and leave Tongzhou safely.

136
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,920
I never thought he would hide

137
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,320
such a big secret from me.

138
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,040
I had my suspicions

139
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,170
that he was keeping something from me.

140
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
It must have been due to his official duties,

141
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,170
so I didn't ask too many questions.

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,610
Sister-in-law.

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,120
You go ahead first,

144
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,050
think carefully about what I said.

145
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,800
You third-rate characters,

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,520
I'll take you in for a proper interrogation.

147
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,580
Let's see if you've got what it takes,

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Mr. Li.

149
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
There are still 10 days until delivery,

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,930
why have you come in person?

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
I happened to have business in Tongzhou,

152
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
so I stopped by to check if these carriages

153
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,320
are as good as you claimed.

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
Rest assured,

155
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,080
the craftsmanship you requested

156
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
can only be achieved by our team of craftsmen

157
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,160
within your delivery timeline.

158
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,560
Mr. Li,

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,880
what are you planning to do

160
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,840
with so many custom high-end carriages

161
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,240
that you've ordered?

162
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
You'll find out when the time comes.

163
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
Rest assured,

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,840
it will definitely be delivered to you in ten days,

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,900
without any delay.

166
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,840
This is a small token from me.

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,640
Thank you, Mr. Li.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,180
Keep it to buy yourself a nice coffin.

169
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,159
Burn this place down on delivery day,

170
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
and make sure it's clean.

171
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,480
Master,

172
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,840
Shi Jia has been killed.

173
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
The registry from his blacksmith shop

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,130
has also been taken.

175
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
Fortunately, according to our plan,

176
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,600
the remaining transaction locations haven't been exposed.

177
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,920
The great gift Shi Jia mentioned in his letter to you

178
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,380
refers to finding Suo Yun.

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
This Suo Yun

180
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
is the one who assassinated Shi Jia.

181
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
We've discovered she is

182
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,000
the wife of Lin Feng, Captain of the Imperial Guard who's been investigating us.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,040
She's currently using the alias Yin Qingmo.

184
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,920
However, I wasn't able to obtain

185
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,620
evidence confirming her clan identity.

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,600
Have you seen how she uses her sword?

187
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,159
I heard that among Shi Jia's wounds,

188
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,620
there was one fatal injury

189
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,120
to his lung.

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,610
A few days ago, my men and I went to test her skills,

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,280
thinking we could subdue her.

192
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Her swordsmanship is exceptional,

193
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,720
with no wasted moves.

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
Do you know why she left a wound in the lung?

195
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
Because it first pierces the opponent's lungs,

196
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,610
making them unable to scream even if they want to.

197
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,890
This is the sword technique used by assassins who excel in stealth.

198
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,480
Does she use her sword like this,

199
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,920
appearing to make a mistake before the second move,

200
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,520
then thrusting diagonally?

201
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,920
The Golden Blade Sect doesn't keep incompetent and negligent people.

202
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
Tell those responsible for transporting the ore

203
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,490
to use a new transaction location,

204
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,160
and from today on, report only to me.

205
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,520
Gotcha!

206
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
Caught you!

207
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Got you now.

208
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,850
There's nowhere to run.

209
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Suoyun,

210
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
I hope you haven't forgotten

211
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
that you're a Jurchen.

212
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,480
My dear,

213
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,000
my old leg injury is hurting a bit,

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
it might rain soon,

215
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,780
I'll bring in the vegetables you hung out to dry.

216
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,520
Let me do it.

217
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
You don't know which ones need to be spread out

218
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
and which ones need watering.

219
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,050
Then I'll help you carry these.

220
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,640
My dear,

221
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,000
Li Qiang says bamboo shoots will be going up in price soon,

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,860
should we get in on that business?

223
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,240
It's only because the Zhao family is buying so much.

224
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
These common folks,

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
they all just follow whatever the rich families do,

226
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,160
it's just a passing trend.

227
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
You go rest first,

228
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,540
I'll be there soon.

229
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,160
My dear.

230
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,200
Do you remember

231
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,400
what I said the day we first met?

232
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,570
We've been married for so long,

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,880
why bring this up now?

234
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,000
That day I said

235
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,340
the past doesn't matter anymore,

236
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,440
do you remember?

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
What's wrong?

238
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,370
It's still the same now.

239
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,620
I should warn Brother Lin.

240
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,360
Let's wait and see what happens.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,240
If Yin Qingmo can deceive those people,

242
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,080
and trick them again,

243
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,580
using their own strength against them would be better.

244
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
But in that case,

245
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,320
should I tell him or not?

246
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Young master,

247
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,530
would you like some?

248
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,360
It's very sweet.

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Would you like grandma to take you to buy a rattle drum?

250
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,480
Let's go.

251
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,300
It's all cold now. I'll heat it up for you.

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,220
Where is everyone?

253
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
Look at this little girl,

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,160
she's quite brave.

255
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,620
You said it was your child.

256
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,280
Do you know his name?

257
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,200
Come with me to the magistrate's office

258
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,530
and let's see if the child recognizes you.

259
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Getting nervous,

260
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
afraid to go?

261
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,370
I've been watching you for a long time.

262
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
You, woman,

263
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,720
hiding at the alley entrance every day to spy on the child.

264
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,250
I've long noticed your sinister intentions.

265
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm going to stick my nose in this business.

266
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,180
Could she be some kind of female hero?

267
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,280
You little brat,

268
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,090
I advise you to mind your own business.

269
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,010
Look, this belongs to the Zhao family.

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,840
Why don't we tie her up

271
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,240
and make more money?

272
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,140
What are you doing?

273
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,900
Don't come any closer!

274
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I've already reported this to the authorities on my way here

275
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,170
and they'll be here any minute.

276
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,800
Want to play the hero

277
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,760
I'll oblige you.

278
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,520
Get him!

279
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,320
Attack!

280
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,890
Look at this guy.

281
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,960
Do you know why I'm using a bamboo stick?

282
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,760
Because you need a dog-beating stick to beat a dog.

283
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,970
I'm telling you, I knew they were bad news from the start.

284
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,880
Yue'er,

285
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,560
please take Lele home now.

286
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,360
Yes, Miss.

287
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
I'll wait for you at the shop.

288
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
We're truly grateful to Miss Zhao and Master Lin

289
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,200
for their brave intervention

290
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,640
that led to the capture of these traffickers.

291
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,920
No need for such formality.

292
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,760
My father always says

293
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,560
that as merchants,

294
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
we should do more to help our community.

295
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,640
From what those traffickers said,

296
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,400
there must be more people behind them.

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,240
Please don't let them off easily, sir,

298
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,280
so our people can live in peace.

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,160
Of course.

300
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,560
Thank you both for your heroic assistance.

301
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,480
Do you know this child?

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,360
Thank you for your help today, Master Lin,

303
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
preventing Lele from falling into the hands of those villains.

304
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,520
Lele is the child of the Xiuluo Fabric Shop owner.

305
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,040
The shop has been very busy lately,

306
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,680
so they've been unable to watch him closely.

307
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,080
I often visit the shop to have clothes made,

308
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,480
so I naturally know Lele.

309
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,040
Fortunately we found him in time,

310
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,320
otherwise the consequences would have been unthinkable.

311
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I see.

312
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,560
Master Lin,

313
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,760
would you allow me to treat you to a meal

314
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,960
to show my gratitude?

315
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,120
You're too kind, Miss Zhao.

316
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,780
Please, just call me Ruoting.

317
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,320
It felt wonderful to be a hero today.

318
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,460
I wonder if you could teach me some martial arts,

319
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,930
so I can fight against evil alongside you?

320
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,560
Though I don't know which noble family you're from,

321
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,440
I can see that the officials

322
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
treat you with great respect.

323
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
Miss Zhao, you need not experience

324
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,620
the dangers of the martial world.

325
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,680
You should return home soon.

326
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,480
I must take my leave now.

327
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,280
Master Lin,

328
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,680
do you dislike people from official families?

329
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,640
My surname isn't Lin,

330
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,240
I...

331
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Why did you lie?

332
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,520
Miss Zhao.

333
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
Miss Ruoting, please don't misunderstand.

334
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,600
I just didn't want to cause any more trouble,

335
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,560
and what I did today was actually a good deed,

336
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,820
so I had no intention of hiding anything.

337
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,680
Then, hero,

338
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,240
would you honestly tell me your name?

339
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,600
I am Chu Bufan.

340
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm from Yingtian Prefecture,

341
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,280
just arrived in Tongzhou a couple of days ago,

342
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,200
and I hope Miss Ruoting can help me out.

343
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,880
Sure.

344
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,700
If you need anything in the future, just let me know.

345
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
However, you just lied to me,

346
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,520
and if you want my forgiveness,

347
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,250
you'll have to accompany me to a nice restaurant.

348
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
Alright then.

349
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,960
Wait a moment.

350
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,359
You truly are a great warrior,

351
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,160
eating like someone who has traveled far and wide.

352
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,319
I wouldn't call myself a great warrior,

353
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,680
but I thought I hadn't revealed anything suspicious.

354
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,160
How did you figure it out, Miss Ruoting?

355
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,839
For the sake of this delicious grilled meat,

356
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,839
would you tell me?

357
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,000
In storybooks, great warriors

358
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
often conceal their true identities.

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
That was your first mistake.

360
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,080
Also,

361
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,800
when you were speaking with the guards today,

362
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,660
you appeared calm on the surface,

363
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
but you made many subtle movements.

364
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,920
You're quite observant, Miss Ruoting.

365
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,900
Did you notice anything else?

366
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,520
You must be hiding some enormous secret.
