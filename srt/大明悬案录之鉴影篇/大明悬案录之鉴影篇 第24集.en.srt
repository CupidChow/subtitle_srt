1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,960
If you keep covering up,

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,840
I won't look for the peacock hairpin.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,400
Goodbye.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,520
Mr. Chu.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,200
Mr. Chu.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,640
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,600
But it concerns Yun Ling's reputation.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
He is the pillar of our troupe.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,380
I really don’t know how to bring it up.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Before the peacock hairpin was lost,

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,040
I did wear it on him.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,360
Yun Ling is not only my disciple,

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
but also a famous male actor in our troupe.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,640
Peacock hairpin can only be worn by a pillar.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,410
[His body is Yu-mi and has a unique voice.]

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,920
He was loved by the nobles.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,320
But since Wang Youshu's performance,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,760
he disappeared.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,680
I don't believe he eloped.

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,800
In that case,

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,200
shouldn't we find Yun Ling first?

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,000
He is a key person.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,320
Mr. Chu.

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,810
Please come with me.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,880
Mr. Chu.

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,080
This is a letter from Ling Ke.

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,120
Leader’s knees.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,410
The one who respects

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:28,840
Minister.

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,000
Fortunately, I met Miss Liuli.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,620
She is from the mansion of Baroness Wang.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,520
We love each other very much.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,520
So we decided to run away.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,050
Since it's decided,

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,880
Although I know it's against the rules,

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,200
and your kindness,

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,039
It’s hard to suppress the love.

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,920
I hope you don’t look into it.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,880
Please don’t blame me.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,680
Your kindness

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
is like the kindness of Mount Tai.

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
I'll never forget.

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,979
I'll repay you in my next life.

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,160
I, Yun Ling, have been panicking.

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Since he has his own fate,

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,720
what are we looking for?

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,480
Maybe Yun Ling has taken it away.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
and gave it to Miss Liuli.

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Impossible.

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Yun Ling would never do that.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
Why are you so sure?

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Because that night,

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,720
I saw Yun Ling Ke

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,400
I met Yun Ling but...

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,280
But the peacock hairpin is no longer on his clothes.

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,040
You mean...

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,890
the time that the peacock hairpin was lost

58
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,840
was probably when the show was not over.

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,880
That's right.

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,940
Although Yun Ling is missing,

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,760
he's not the one who stole the peacock hairpin.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,920
Do you know who Liuli is?

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,960
I’ve never seen her or heard of her.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Mr. Shao.

65
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,880
I can keep looking for it for you.

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,920
But if you lie to me,

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,760
I won’t let you go.

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Mr. Chu,

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,760
This is 300 taels of silver.

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,960
Consider it the deposit for finding the peacock hairpin.

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,520
Leader.

72
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,000
You’re really willing to pay.

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Mr. Chu,

74
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,960
I’m not hiding anything from you.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,079
The 300 taels of silver is the proof of my sincerity.

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
I’m just a troupe leader.

77
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,810
My savings are limited.

78
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,240
I’ve worked hard for 300 taels for years.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,320
Leader is so sincere.

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,980
If I suspect you again,

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
if I suspect you again.

82
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,720
Since you've accepted the deposit,

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,560
I will try my best to help you find the peacock hairpin.

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,160
If I fail to find it,

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,920
I’ll pay you 300 taels of deposit.

86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,640
Thank you for helping me.

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you so much.

88
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,920
Mr. Shao, wait for the good news.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Burn incense to worship the moon.

90
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:31,400
Burn incense to worship the moon.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:42,360
I pray for nothing else.

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:05:01,120
May you be blessed.

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
God,

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,570
please eliminate the bad luck.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
and protect me.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,160
and eliminate evil.

97
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
and protect me.

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
God,

99
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,560
I beg you to eliminate evil.

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Who is it?

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,560
Don't come near me!

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
Spare...

103
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,040
Please forgive me.

104
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,760
A wrong has a source.

105
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
I didn't hurt you.

106
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,080
You got the wrong person.

107
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
It's none of my business.

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
I'm just a peasant.

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
Please forgive me.

110
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
Please spare me.

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,960
Evil spirits,

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,160
Please.

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,200
Look at you.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Wang Youshu,

115
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,640
You must have done a lot of bad things.

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Let me go.

117
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,720
Qi Ming.

118
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Did you find anything?

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,800
We're in trouble this time.

120
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
Usually big families

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,840
always hire some chores.

122
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,800
I can sneak in and find out the truth.

123
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
But this nobleman

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,200
is really tight.

125
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Other than raising young servants,

126
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,320
Other servants are introduced by acquaintances

127
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,440
to work

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,280
I can't get in without a way.

129
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Their family members are very strict.

130
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,840
So strict.

131
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,210
It shows that there's a ghost here.

132
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Look closely, you're a handsome man.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,240
You're pretty.

134
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,200
Why don't you try to find a companion?

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,659
Maybe you can sneak in and find out the truth.

136
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,880
Stop!

137
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
Forget it.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Baroness Wang's family is full of strange things.

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,010
Who knows if there’s a trap inside?

140
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,640
Besides,

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,120
I feel a bit uneasy this time.

142
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,440
If there's no other way,

143
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,520
we'll see.

144
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
However,

145
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,880
you said that handsome man is pretty.

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,880
I admit it.

147
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,400
In that case,

148
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,050
let's find another way.

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
A few days ago,

150
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,080
a new companion.

151
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,200
named Bai Yue.

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
Qi Ming, look into him.

153
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,760
Bai Yue.

154
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,650
The girl named Bai Yue just came in.

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
Newbies always

156
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
some mistakes.

157
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,360
The places he frequents

158
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,880
or people who interact with the outside world

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,760
may leave

160
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
we can find.

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,080
If you start from this direction,

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,540
you might find something.

163
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,760
Okay.

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,440
You're smarter than me anyway.

165
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll listen to you.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,040
I'll find out

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,640
to find out who Bai Yue is.

168
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
and hobbies.

169
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,760
After all,

170
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,160
we have 1,000 taels.

171
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,240
Take out the best fragrance powder

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
the best fragrance powder here.

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,120
Okay, sir.

174
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
Please wait a moment.

175
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,760
This

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
This

177
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,520
This

178
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,640
And this.

179
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Wrap them up.

180
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,490
and send them to Baroness Wang’s mansion.

181
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,280
Baroness Wang’s companion is so generous.

182
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,040
It's only been a few days since White Moon left.

183
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
You're already so generous.

184
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,120
Sichuan brocade is really from heaven.

185
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
The texture and the pattern

186
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,080
is amazing.

187
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,320
Boss.

188
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,410
I'll take the Sichuan brocade.

189
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Sorry, Young Master.

190
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,880
Mrs. Situ of Sichuan brocade has booked it.

191
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,800
No delivery.

192
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
If you like it, reserve it now.

193
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,800
It'll arrive in a month or two.

194
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Ready?

195
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,360
So what?

196
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
I work for Baroness Wang.

197
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,210
How dare you refuse to sell your shop to me?

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,640
So what if you're Baroness Wang's companion?

199
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,000
Rules are rules.

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Sichuan brocade is not for sale.

201
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Why are you so ungrateful?

202
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
Say it again.

203
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
I work for Baroness Wang.

204
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,530
Don’t make a scene here.

205
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,610
If you don't get out, I'll ask my men to invite you out.

206
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
You hit me?

207
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,600
So what?

208
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,120
Fine.

209
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,320
You bitch!

210
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,960
It’s just a cloth store.

211
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,420
I’ll take someone to smash your cloth store.

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,560
Who did it?

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,400
Who did it?

214
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,560
Who did it?

215
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,320
Who did it? Who did it?

216
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,000
You and Ruoting.

217
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,840
are really good.

218
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,680
But White Moon likes to buy cloth.

219
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,620
she provided us with a direction.

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Ruoting might be able to help us.

221
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,320
But...

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,880
Bai Yue and Ruoting are fighting like this.

223
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
can they help us?

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
White Moon is very narrow-minded.

225
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
He'll probably go back for revenge.

226
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,440
You underestimated Ruoting.

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,920
Women have more ways than us.

228
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,800
Come out, bitch!

229
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,760
If you don’t kneel down and apologize to me today,

230
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
I’ll smash your cloth store.

231
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,400
Sir,

232
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,780
What are you doing?

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
What's going on?

234
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
Why are you asking me?

235
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,240
Let me ask you.

236
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,080
Did you send someone

237
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,960
Did you send someone to water me?

238
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
Do you admit it or not?

239
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,640
Poop.

240
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,080
Sir.

241
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,960
Someone splashed dung on you.

242
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,690
Are you pretending?

243
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,600
Young Master.

244
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,450
I think you misunderstood.

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
I can't do

246
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
I can't do that.

247
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,970
Why don't you go to the place where it happened again?

248
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,880
You don’t admit it?

249
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,400
Smash her cloth store!

250
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,160
I’ll see how she’ll show off.

251
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,720
Wait.

252
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,760
Young Master.

253
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,880
I think you don’t know

254
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
this cloth store belongs to Zhao Mansion, right?

255
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,320
Zhao Mansion?

256
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
All the shops in this street belong to the Zhao family.

257
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
In terms of manpower and family background,

258
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,480
Baroness Wang can't beat the Zhao family, right?

259
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
Sir,

260
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,640
I think

261
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,640
really want to trouble your master.

262
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,920
Then my bullying yesterday was in vain.

263
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,800
It was my fault last time.

264
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,920
I hit you.

265
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,520
I apologize to you.

266
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,880
This Luminous Sichuan brocade

267
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,610
the Luminous Sichuan brocade.

268
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,040
I've discussed it with Mrs. Situ.

269
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,890
She agreed to give it to you.

270
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,680
I'll give it to you now.

271
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,960
I hope we can get along

272
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,480
and get along.

273
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,440
Sister.

274
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
If you were like this earlier,

275
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
how could we

276
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
end up like this?

277
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,000
Sister, you're really a gentleman.

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
and elegant.

279
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
In that case,

280
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,840
our grudges

281
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
between us.

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
There's no grudge between us.

283
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,880
Let bygones be bygones.

284
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,200
You can call me White Moon from now on.

285
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Okay.

286
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,920
I'll send someone to send you

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll send someone to send them to the manor.

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay?

289
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,280
That's great.

290
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,560
Good.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,320
I'll leave you alone.

292
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,820
If you have good materials in the future,

293
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,600
I will.

294
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,480
Goodbye.

295
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,680
What a sister.

296
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Now

297
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,960
more and more like a businessman.

298
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
What you said just now

299
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,640
is really sharp and flawless.

300
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,560
Of course.

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,460
If I don't learn business,

302
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,660
how can I manage the family business?

303
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
You always help me.

304
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,720
Thank you, Ruoting.

305
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,720
But I need you

306
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,240
to ask around for me again.

307
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,440
Chu Bufan.

308
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,600
In terms of appreciation,

309
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
I should thank you.

310
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,520
If you hadn't been encouraging me

311
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,580
and supporting me,

312
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,140
I'm afraid I can't hold on any longer.

313
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,120
Ruoting.

314
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,880
Do we need to talk about this?

315
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,440
Okay.

316
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,520
What should I do next?

317
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,800
just tell me.
