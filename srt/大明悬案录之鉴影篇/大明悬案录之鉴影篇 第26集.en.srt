1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Who are you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,130
Why don't you dare show your true face?

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,760
Catch him!

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,940
Over there!

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,500
Looks like I'll have to hide here for a while.

6
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,280
Ruoting.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,960
It's me.

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,360
Chu Bufan.

9
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,650
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,880
That Cheng Tianci has sent men searching for me throughout the city.

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,610
Didn't I tell you to be careful?

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,240
Follow me.

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,880
Hide in there first,

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,009
I'll check what's happening outside.

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,400
Open up!

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,320
Imperial guards are here to arrest a criminal,

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,850
open the door immediately!

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,160
May I ask why the imperial guards are visiting so late at night,

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
what's the urgent matter?

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Cut the nonsense.

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm pursuing a wanted criminal,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
who has likely hidden in your residence.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,560
Step aside and let me search inside.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
Wait.

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
Why is the Cloud Cavalry Officer

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,900
visiting my Zhao residence so late at night?

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,520
Miss Zhao,

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,640
the authorities are hunting a notorious bandit

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,680
who may be hiding in your residence.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,919
Please cooperate

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,560
and have all rooms opened

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
so we can conduct our search.

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,090
The Cloud Cavalry Officer is truly imposing.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,120
However, sending men to intrude upon my residence at night

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
seems rather improper, doesn't it?

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,400
Though my Zhao family has declined somewhat,

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,040
we still maintain considerable wealth and status,

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,300
not just anyone can enter as they please.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,960
Without solid evidence,

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,560
is such a search by the Cloud Cavalry Officer appropriate?

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Miss Zhao,

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm simply trying to assist the authorities

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,320
in capturing this bandit,

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,050
with no ill intentions.

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,140
If you obstruct us,

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
it suggests you have something to hide.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,970
Officer, your words are too harsh.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
My family is beyond reproach,

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
there's nothing to hide.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
This bandit you claim to be after,

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,200
where is the wanted poster?

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,360
Where were his crimes committed?

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,620
And what's the bounty?

54
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,080
Since you can't answer these questions

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,810
and have no official notice...

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
I cannot allow anyone to search inside,

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,360
if I let your men in today,

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,560
then tomorrow will everyone else

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,290
be able to barge into my Zhao residence as you did?

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
If that's the case,

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,290
then I won't search.

62
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,960
However, may I ask Miss Zhao

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
for a private conversation,

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
would you do me this favor?

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,160
It's late. Not convenient.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,650
Cloud Cavalry Officer, please leave.

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,360
When I saw you at Squire Wang's house last time,

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,320
I was immediately drawn to you.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
You know my position and authority,

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
I advise you not to oppose me.

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,860
Otherwise, even though I have feelings for you,

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,880
I will show no mercy.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,560
Yes.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,720
Reporting, Cloud Cavalry Officer.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,840
There's nothing unusual at the Zhao residence.

76
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
Miss Zhao is in her room reading by lamplight,

77
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,240
and no suspicious activity elsewhere.

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,200
Cloud Cavalry Officer,

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,330
do you need any further arrangements?

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,560
No need.

81
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,409
Just keep an eye on the Zhao residence.

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,080
As long as that person is still in Tongzhou,

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,720
he won't escape my grasp.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,400
Miss,

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
those men have left,

86
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,480
and there's nothing unusual in the residence for now.

87
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,160
Well done.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,640
Continue to strengthen the patrol

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,560
and remain vigilant.

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,080
If there are any more uninvited guests,

91
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,540
report to me immediately.

92
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,520
Thank you.

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Otherwise I'd have been in real trouble this time.

94
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,240
What have you done?

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,200
They've chased you all the way to the Zhao residence.

96
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,680
I accidentally overheard his conversation with Wang Pengshu.

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,800
The Peacock Feather is indeed connected to them,

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,040
and they might have even harmed Yun Lingke.

99
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Ruoting, what did you find out?

100
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
According to my investigation,

101
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
when he was young,

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,090
he was just an ordinary soldier

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
who distinguished himself in a minor border skirmish

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,000
by killing an enemy general.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,960
He was promoted for his achievements,

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,290
and the court granted him the title of Cloud Cavalry Captain

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
to honor his military merit.

108
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Cheng Tianci does have some skills.

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,320
Skills, yes,

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,480
but his character is questionable.

111
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,960
Since becoming Cloud Cavalry Captain,

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,600
he's been colluding with local power brokers.

113
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
Cheng Tianci not only serves as

114
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
Wang Pengshu's advisor and assistant,

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,280
but also helps him consolidate local power.

116
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,200
They secretly

117
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,480
control many businesses in Tongzhou,

118
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
eliminating opponents,

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
truly partners in crime.

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,880
Have you heard of someone named Liuli?

121
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,560
Liuli?

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,659
Never heard of her.

123
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,560
Though judging by the name,

124
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,400
she sounds like a maid from some wealthy household

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,930
or perhaps an entertainer.

126
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
Yun Lingke mentioned her in his letter before disappearing.

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Now Cheng Tianci

128
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,480
is also connected to Yun Lingke,

129
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,650
there must be something suspicious going on.

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,920
What do you plan to do?

131
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,340
I haven't decided yet,

132
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll go back and discuss it with Qi Ming.

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,960
How's it going? Any progress?

134
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't even ask.

135
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
I ran into a tough nut to crack today.

136
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,200
I didn't expect Cheng Tianci to be so skilled.

137
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,360
We've alerted them today,

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,820
so it'll be harder to investigate tomorrow.

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,620
Are we still going tomorrow then?

140
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,700
Tomorrow you'll come with me.

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,760
That cunning Cheng Tianci.

142
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Qiming,

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
you'll distract him.

144
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,280
Who's chasing us?

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,260
After them!

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,680
Fine.

147
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,460
Could this be the costume with the peacock feather?

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,840
Sir, please spare me.

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,680
I just love seeing you adorable people

150
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
crying and begging for mercy.

151
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,040
Sir,

152
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,680
please let me go.

153
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,040
Spare you?

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,280
Too bad I'm not done playing yet.

155
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,440
Sir.

156
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,040
Sir.

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Sir, please have mercy on me.

158
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,120
Wake up.

159
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,720
Don't be afraid,

160
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,980
I'm here to rescue you.

161
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,120
But,

162
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,780
but the Imperial Rider...

163
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,760
Why do you still care about him?

164
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,620
When he wakes up, he'll be going straight to prison.

165
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,800
Thank you for saving my life, Brother Chu.

166
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,770
Please get up first.

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,080
Achun,

168
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,640
do you know a maid named Liuli?

169
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
Liuli?

170
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,100
Never heard of her.

171
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
This Liuli,

172
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,920
could it be that it's not even a person's name?

173
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,780
We've been searching for so long without any leads.

174
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
That's possible.

175
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,360
Does liuli have any other names?

176
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,640
Liuli has many alternative names,

177
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,680
like five-colored stone, blue jade, medicinal jade,

178
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,480
they all refer to the same thing.

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,760
Blue jade...

180
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,080
Oh right,

181
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,460
I just remembered,

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,330
I used to have a personal sachet

183
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,320
but Cheng Tianci took it from me.

184
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,660
He said it was trash

185
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,810
and casually threw it into a blue jade dish to burn it.

186
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
A blue jade dish?

187
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Brother Chu,

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,340
I've heard that blue jade is a translucent material

189
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,440
because it can reflect light and shadow,

190
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,960
ancient people believed it could connect the living and the dead.

191
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,240
If a vengeful spirit won't leave,

192
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
the best method

193
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,120
is to throw things into a blue jade dish and burn them,

194
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
to dissolve the resentment.

195
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,500
It must be a personal item.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,680
A personal item...

197
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Burning...

198
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,560
Liuli...

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,120
Cheng Tianci worships evil gods

200
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,360
because he has done too many unconscionable things.

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,420
He burned your sachet in the jade dish

202
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
because he feared that after torturing you to death,

203
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,850
your vengeful spirit would come back for him.

204
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
That makes sense now.

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,640
Yun Lingke's peacock feather

206
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,900
must have also been burned by Cheng Tianci in the jade dish.

207
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,960
Get some good rest tonight,

208
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,920
tomorrow morning we'll report this to the authorities.

209
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,600
Achun,

210
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,360
when the time comes, you must tell everything

211
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
you know.

212
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,140
Damn, we couldn't shake them off.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,600
Chu Bufan.

214
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,440
Chu Bufan.

215
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,720
Ruoting,

216
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,200
what are you doing here?

217
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
I knew you stubborn fool

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,560
wouldn't let go of Cheng Tianci,

219
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
so I was worried about your safety

220
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,780
and sent people to track you down.

221
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,970
Miss Zhao, you're truly a timely rain,

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,300
saving me from danger.

223
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,960
You all should come back to the Zhao mansion with me quickly,

224
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
I'll keep you safe.
