1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,360
Luo Qiuming.

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,320
Surrender yourself.

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,120
You can't escape.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,600
I'll kill you lackeys!

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
How dare you be so rude in front of the Imperial Guard?

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
Don't you know what you're capable of?

7
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,320
It's no use catching me.

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,720
I won't say a word.

9
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,520
Centipede.

10
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,280
Why is this in my mouth?

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,920
Could it be a spell?

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,640
Luo Qiuming.

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,640
Luo Qiuming.

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
Wake up.

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,120
He's dead.

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,080
The clue of the Iron ore case is dead.

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,520
Luo Qiuming died mysteriously.

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,880
Someone must be behind it.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
We have to be careful.

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
What should we do now?

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,079
Find out where he went before he died.

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,840
before he died.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,200
Bring his body back to the Shenwu Guards.

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Please examine the body.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
I knew it.

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Master Liu.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Did you find anything?

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,079
Luo Qiuming died of poisoning.

29
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,440
And it’s not an ordinary poison.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
His organs were devoured by poisonous insects.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,760
It's so rotten that it's hard to identify.

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Such a death

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,800
is extremely rare.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Poison insects?

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,520
Is it really the legendary Gu poison?

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Poison?

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
Rumor has it that it controls people's hearts with poisonous insects.

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,880
It can control people's lives.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,400
For many years,

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
there were many rumors,

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
there has never been solid evidence

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
to prove the existence of Gu poison.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480
I dare not make any assumptions.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,000
These rumors are often hard to tell.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,880
But Luo Qiuming's death is too strange.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
If it weren’t for the Gu poison,

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,800
it’s hard to explain

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Why did he spit out centipedes before he died?

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,480
Master Liu.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,040
Continue to check the body.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,920
Let me know if you find anything.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,760
Boss, a bowl of porridge.

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,040
Sir.

54
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
There's no porridge today.

55
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680
Come again tomorrow.

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,120
We're closed today.

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Ahn.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Good.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Good.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
You're a girl.

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,360
miss us so much?

62
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Prepare the food and wine.

63
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,760
Brother Chu, Brother Ah Liang.

64
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,640
I really miss you.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,960
Last time you said you were coming to Shuntian Prefecture,

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
but you stayed in Tongzhou for a while.

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,960
I was so happy.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,760
I've been looking forward to your coming.

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,560
Hurry up.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Let's pack up and go home.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,159
I miss you so much.

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,440
Mr. Lin.

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,120
Don't forget to bring this home.

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,280
Your sister-in-law washes them clean every time.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,160
How virtuous.

76
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,240
You have to work hard again.

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
I have to wash your clothes

78
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
you've never worn before.

79
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,080
But your clothes are not worn at all.

80
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,440
Didn't your sister-in-law ask you?

81
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,320
How about this?

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
Next time you wear it,

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,480
I'll fix your legs.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,320
It's more real.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
You've grown up.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,640
Take care, Lord Lin.

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,159
Honey.

88
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
My husband is back.

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,640
Why do you always wear your uniform so dirty?

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,560
It's inevitable to get dirty when running around.

91
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Thank you.

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,920
Father is back.

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
Little naughty girl.

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,640
Look what I brought you.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,159
Windmill.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
This is for you.

97
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,040
Do you like it?

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Yes.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,840
Father.

100
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,000
I want you to ride a horse with me.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
Okay, ride a horse.

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Coming.

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't hurt the child.

104
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Don't worry, honey.

105
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
You guys...

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
I said to get a fish.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,280
but you insist on saying it's troublesome.

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
It's rare for you to come here.

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,760
Although my porridge shop is not big,

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,720
I don't earn much,

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,560
But at least let me

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
to entertain you.

113
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Look at this.

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
Je'an.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
We're brothers.

116
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,240
It doesn't matter what we eat.

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
What's important is we don't get together often.

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
Your porridge

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,760
tastes better than those fish and meat in Jianghu.

120
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,320
You're right.

121
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
After many years,

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,480
we can still eat your porridge.

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,120
That's enough.

124
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
Besides, Brother Chu and I

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,280
are strong.

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
Look at you.

127
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,960
You should eat more.

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,080
I...

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
The hard days have passed.

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,320
Cherish the present.

131
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
and take care of yourself.

132
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,880
We have more things to do in the future.

133
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
I know, Brother Chu.

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,120
Mine

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,960
I eat a lot, but my luck isn't good.

136
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,680
You're joking again.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,400
Eat

138
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Let's eat.

139
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,880
By the way, Brother Chu,

140
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
you mentioned in your letter that

141
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,680
you asked me to find you a blacksmith

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
in Tongzhou.

143
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,320
I heard

144
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,120
a master named Shijia in Tongzhou

145
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
who has excellent skills.

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,159
Many people came to him to forge swords.

147
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,000
I know him.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
He seems to be quite powerful.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,320
There's no martial artist you don't know.

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,240
I'll stay in the porridge shop tomorrow.

151
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
You can

152
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
in my little house.

153
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
If you need anything,

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
if you need me.

155
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,920
Tongzhou is not a small place.

156
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,080
I can still

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,000
some information.

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,920
Come to the porridge shop for breakfast tomorrow.

159
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
I'll prepare it for you.

160
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
Is your porridge shop doing good every month?

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,760
On the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month,

162
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,200
to give porridge to the 15th store every month.

163
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,640
I'll visit the kids on the first day of the festival.

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,560
Let's eat.

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,320
Let's eat

166
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
Hot buns

167
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
Come and see the buns

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
Madam, please take a look inside.

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,039
All vegetables and meat.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,680
My lord,

171
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
We found the last place

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
before he died

173
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
is this blacksmith shop.

174
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,560
The owner of this shop, Shi Jia,

175
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
is a famous craftsman.

176
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,720
I don’t think he’s a spy.

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,400
Luo Qiuming wouldn't come to Shi Jia for no reason.

178
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
Maybe as you said,

179
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,840
he's just here to make some good weapons.

180
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,680
But a blacksmith shop needs iron ore.

181
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,680
Since Luo Qiuming was here,

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,800
we have to look into it.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,840
Don't miss anything.

184
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
But don't alert them.

185
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,440
See you next time.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Shi Jia looks fierce.

187
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm afraid there's something wrong.

188
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Don't judge a book by its cover.

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,560
What you see may not be true.

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,080
Be alert.

191
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,240
See if there is any other clue.

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
Manager Shi.

193
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Let’s go inside.

194
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,120
I'll be right there.

195
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Okay.

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,560
You have good taste.

197
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,720
This is the best weapon

198
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,240
all these years.

199
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
The sword is like frost.

200
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,880
If you really like it,

201
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,960
it has found its own master.

202
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,560
I won't let you down.

203
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
It's really good.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
I like it.

205
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
I'll use this sword well from now on.

206
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
But I came to you today

207
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,440
to customize a weapon.

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
I have a drawing.

209
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Take a look.

210
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm new here.

211
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know who's good or bad.

212
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't get yourself into trouble.

213
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,000
It's for everyone.

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,600
Are you crazy?

215
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
I have nothing against you.

216
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
I won't report you.

217
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,120
Let's go our separate ways.

218
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,640
Something happened.

219
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,880
Don't move.

220
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm just here to play swordsmanship.

221
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
What are you doing?

222
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,240
I suspect you're the suspect's accomplice.

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
Let's talk in the prison.

224
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,840
No.

225
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,240
It's a misunderstanding.

226
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't move.

227
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,560
Sir.

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,680
Go check on Shigaka.

229
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,160
Sir.

230
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
Isn't he dead?

231
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
How can he move?

232
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,680
Did he come back to life?

233
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,160
That's impossible.

234
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,240
The dead won't come back to life.

235
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Then he's dead.

236
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,600
Centipede.

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,800
Centipede again?

238
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,120
What is this?

239
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,240
This is exactly like the Gu poison in Luo Qiuming.

240
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
Poison?

241
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,280
You Shenwu Guards believe in this?

242
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
This is neither a zombie nor a Gu poison.

243
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
This blacksmith

244
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,200
in this blacksmith's body.

245
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Although he's dead,

246
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,640
his nerves were torn by poisonous insects

247
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,160
and reacted.

248
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
These nerves can still

249
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,720
in a short time.

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,160
and cause spasm.

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,840
That's why it happened.

252
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
How do you know so much?

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
Who are you?

254
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,600
How did you know about us?

255
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
The Shenwu Guards are famous.

256
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
You are all elites of the imperial court.

257
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,360
You have the responsibility to protect Tongzhou

258
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,800
and dealing with rebellion.

259
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,080
I guessed your identities

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
after seeing your clothes.

261
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,920
It should be the rank of the champion.

262
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm Chu Bufan from Jianghu.

263
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
I just arrived in Tongzhou yesterday.

264
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,920
Nice to meet you.

265
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,200
Nice to meet you.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Sure.

267
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,120
Chu Bufan.

268
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
I heard your name.

269
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,360
But I don't care how famous you are.

270
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
if I find out

271
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
you did something evil,

272
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,040
I won't let you go.

273
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
What did I do?

274
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,360
I didn't kill him.

275
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,640
I didn't feed the bugs.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The poisoner must have

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,560
there must be medicine

278
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,120
and relieve the toxin.

279
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,400
to control Shi Jia.

280
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
The priority now

281
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
is to find the poisoner.

282
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
Don’t play tricks.

283
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,400
Before the truth is revealed,

284
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,560
if you dare to step out of Tongzhou,

285
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
I promise your head

286
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,800
at the city gate.

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,040
If you dare to escape,

288
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,560
I will not go easy on you.

289
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
We will definitely issue a warrant

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,320
Kill them all.
