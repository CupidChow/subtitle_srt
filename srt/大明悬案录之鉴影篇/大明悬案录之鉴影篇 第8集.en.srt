1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm going to kill you.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,280
Give me back my life!

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
She's dead.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,120
She's dead.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,260
Someone come quickly!

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,860
Go report to the authorities at once!

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,320
What terrible luck.

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Mrs. Gu,

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
Lanxin died so tragically.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,560
Let's cover her with a cloth,

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,610
so everyone won't be frightened by the sight.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,770
Cover the body first

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,880
and wait for the officials to arrive.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,320
In broad daylight like this,

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,720
it's like seeing a ghost.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,120
Until we uncover the truth,

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,560
all of you keep your mouths shut.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,039
Hanxiu.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,610
Today was supposed to be your special day,

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,120
yet such a terrible thing happened.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,970
We'll have to reschedule for another day.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I'll do whatever you say, Madam Gu.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,740
What are we going to do now?

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,039
How am I supposed to explain this to Master Lin?

25
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,680
This is just too pitiful,

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,800
really.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,960
He came all the way

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,759
from Luoyang specifically for Hanxiu,

29
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,160
bringing a thousand taels of gold with him.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,759
Someone has died here,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,460
what do you expect me to do?

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,880
Go and pacify Master Lin first.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,680
Tell him

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,080
as long as he has enough gold,

35
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,010
Hanxiu will be his sooner or later.

36
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,840
Master Lin.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,370
I'm terribly sorry.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
Where is the body?

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,610
Take us to see it.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
I just covered it with a white cloth.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,010
What's... what's going on?

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
What... what's happening here?

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Where's the body?

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,240
I covered it with this cloth myself.

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,200
Someone has switched it out.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,460
This is truly bizarre.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,210
Look at this wooden tablet,

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,500
there's writing on it.

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Chu Bufan.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Chu Bufan.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,160
Which Chu Bufan?

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Constable Li,

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,560
didn't you report a murder case?

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,440
Why are you presenting me with a scarecrow?

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,040
Sir,

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,280
we received a report that

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,810
the artist Lanxin was dead.

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
But when we arrived at the scene,

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,880
only this scarecrow was left.

60
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Oh, and there was also this wooden pendant.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
I suspect the person whose name is written on this pendant

62
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,740
must be connected to the artist's death.

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Chu Bufan?

64
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Isn't he the one who achieved merit alongside

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,840
the Captain of the Imperial Guard?

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,079
How could he be involved

67
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,410
in a murder case at the painting workshop?

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,440
Recently, the townspeople have been saying...

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,600
Are those righteous deeds of his in the jianghu

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,000
perhaps

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
nothing but a sham?

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,770
Constable Li

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm giving you three days

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
to arrest Chu Bufan without fail.

75
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,240
Sir

76
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,760
I've heard this Chu Bufan is quite skilled

77
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,760
with exceptional martial arts

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,640
I fear he won't be easy to capture quickly.

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Are you all just useless parasites?

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,580
Claiming defeat before even trying,

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,000
what's the point of the court paying your salaries?

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
I don't care what methods you use,

83
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
you must arrest Chu Bufan within three days,

84
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,560
within three days, understood?

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,900
Brother Liang.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,960
What is it?

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
A constable just gave me this,

88
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
asked me to watch for this person,

89
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,380
gave me 10 coins and told me to keep quiet,

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,520
to observe secretly,

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
and when I looked at the person they want to arrest.

92
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
It's Brother Chu.

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,570
You killed someone.

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
Are you sleepwalking or am I?

95
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
This can't be possible,

96
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,690
must be someone with the same name.

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,120
This drawing is quite good.

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
It really is me.

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,920
Could I have actually been sleepwalking

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,650
and done such a terrible thing?

101
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
Get a grip.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,480
No one would believe that story.

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
Think harder.

104
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
Could it be an enemy coming after you,

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
or something else?

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,920
That's impossible.

107
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm still at a loss.

108
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
Maybe I should ask Lin Feng.

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
Would he believe you?

110
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,480
No,

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,700
he probably won't believe I killed someone.

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,050
Then go ask him quickly.

113
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,040
The authorities are secretly hunting for him now.

114
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Xiao Wu gave me all this information.

115
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
They know you're hard to catch,

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
so they've assigned many undercover agents to watch you.

117
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
Be careful when you go out.

118
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,300
Alright, wait for my news.

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Boss.

120
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,000
About the money I owe you from yesterday,

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll bring it to you first thing tomorrow morning.

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,760
I was worried you might be concerned,

123
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,690
so I came specially to let you know.

124
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
I have a small job this afternoon,

125
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm going to earn some extra money first.

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
Good, that's fine.

127
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
You're a regular customer,

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,640
you're being too polite.

129
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,940
It's no problem, there's no rush.

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,040
Official business!

131
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Cooperate fully. Keep it quiet.

132
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,600
Boss Li,

133
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
We went to that porridge shop

134
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
that Chu Bufan frequents,

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
and we spotted him,

136
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,760
but we lost him.

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
That guy is really fast.

138
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I examined the pastries he gave to the shop owner,

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,700
but found no clues inside.

140
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,600
Could Chu Bufan know we're after him,

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,000
and was just testing us?

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Looks like we've tipped him off.

143
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,250
Let's keep searching. Be careful.

144
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,280
Brother,

145
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,159
let me help you.

146
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,880
Thank you.

147
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,920
You're new here,

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,380
I haven't seen you before.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm the newly hired painting assistant.

150
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,640
Perfect timing.

151
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,159
Help me take this inside.

152
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,880
This?

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Brother,

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
how long have you been working here?

155
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,400
How's the pay here?

156
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Is it good?

157
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,170
This is the Yanbo Painting Studio.

158
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,050
The clients are either wealthy

159
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,840
or have powerful connections.

160
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Working here pays well.

161
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,960
I notice all these painters

162
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,280
are young women.

163
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Aren't there any male painters here?

164
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Male painters are nothing special,

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,200
they're everywhere outside.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,920
Our Yanbo Studio only employs female painters.

167
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,400
The painters here

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,659
were all carefully selected by Madam Gu,

169
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,539
who personally taught them the art of painting.

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Each of them

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
combines talent and beauty.

172
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,280
Not only are they skilled artists,

173
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,210
but they can also endure hardship.

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
What do you mean?

175
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,760
These young ladies

176
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,880
don't come from poor families,

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,440
yet they've all chosen to come to this Yanbo Painting Studio.

178
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Here,

179
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,280
when they practice painting,

180
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,540
their hands often develop blisters.

181
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,480
It pains me to see it,

182
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,160
but they continue to work tirelessly.

183
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
Why are they working so hard?

184
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,200
They say once they master the skills,

185
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
a single painting can sell for 10 taels of gold,

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
and might even change their fate.

187
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,300
The bounty on my head is also 10 taels of gold.

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,760
It seems any painting by these girls

189
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
is worth the same as my life.

190
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,530
Ten taels of gold

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
is enough for an ordinary family

192
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
to live on for a year.

193
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,170
No wonder they work so hard.

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Actually, 10 taels isn't that much.

195
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
If a nobleman takes a liking to them,

196
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,220
they could enjoy endless wealth and luxury.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,460
What does it mean to be 'taken a liking to' by a nobleman?

198
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
Could it be

199
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,180
becoming a concubine?

200
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,770
It's hard to say.

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Although these girls aren't from humble backgrounds,

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,760
it's still not easy for them

203
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,690
to become a nobleman's concubine.

204
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,640
Most are just fleeting romances,

205
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,840
temporary pleasures

206
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,000
that cannot last.

207
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
How is this any different from a brothel?

208
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,040
Aren't these girls from respectable families?

209
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,970
Would they really consent to this?

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
How can brothel girls compare to these ladies?

211
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,400
First, there's a clear distinction in social status.

212
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,840
Not to mention the qualifications required to enter the painting house.

213
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,640
For those officials and nobles,

214
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,640
visiting the painting house is far more refined than going to a brothel,

215
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,970
and much more discreet.

216
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Besides,

217
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
some girls, for the sake of survival,

218
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
are probably willing to do this.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,360
Of course.

220
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
All of this is just hearsay I've picked up,

221
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I don't even know if it's true or not.

222
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm just a laborer here,

223
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,000
knowing too much doesn't do me any good anyway.

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,640
I would never bring my daughter

225
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,170
to work in a place like this.

226
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,120
To outsiders, this place looks like a temple of art,

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,370
but actually...

228
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
Back to work!

229
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,160
By the way,

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,720
um,

231
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
do you know where Miss Lanxin's room is?

232
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,780
No, why are you asking about that?

233
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
To be honest with you,

234
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm the new painting assistant Miss Lanxin just hired,

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,170
so naturally I need to find her.

236
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
But Miss Lanxin is dead.

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,880
Dead?

238
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
How... how is that possible?

239
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Her death was suspicious.

240
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Everyone says...

241
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,200
How tragic.

242
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,050
But Madam Gu specifically instructed

243
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
not to hire any young painting assistants.

244
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,280
You must be mistaken.

245
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
Her previous room is over there.

246
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,420
If you want to go see it,

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
you'd better not.

248
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
That's bad luck,

249
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,560
okay.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,760
Got it,

251
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,160
thanks, man.

252
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,040
This is the mark of the Ghost Market.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,530
Lanxin has actually been to the Ghost Market.

254
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,490
So this is the legendary Ghost Market.

255
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,560
Excuse me?

256
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,500
Do you have this medicine?

257
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,480
No.

258
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
Do you know where I can buy it?

259
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
The medicine vendor is dead.

260
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,080
You can't get it anymore.

261
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Dead?

262
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,330
Then do you know what kind of medicine this is?

263
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,120
No idea.

264
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,600
Go look somewhere else,

265
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,860
and stop bothering me.

266
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,060
Seems I won't find anything useful here either.

267
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,520
Was I wrong?

268
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,400
Who are you?

269
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,040
You don't even know who I am,

270
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,570
so why are you following me?

271
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
So you noticed all along.

272
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I've underestimated you.

273
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,360
Those who underestimate me

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,080
usually don't end up well.

275
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,680
What's your relationship with Lanxin?

276
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,920
I am Lanxin.

277
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Well, well, Lanxin,

278
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,970
you're actually alive!

279
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,000
Come with me to the authorities to clear things up

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,960
and restore my innocence.

281
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,920
It's because of you

282
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,840
that I'm now a fugitive on the run.

283
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,320
Chu Bufan.

284
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
It really is you.

285
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,120
It's not safe here.

286
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
If you want to know the truth,

287
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,680
please follow me to a safe place.

288
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,440
Alright.

289
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,320
Well, I'd like to see

290
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
what you're really up to.

291
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,640
Is this far enough?

292
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,420
What do you want to say?

293
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,320
I've long admired your reputation,

294
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,960
and now I finally meet you in person.

295
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
Please help us, Master Chu.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
I'll save you.

297
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,090
What do you mean?

298
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Last time when we sold it,

299
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,680
Master Lin paid

300
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,860
a full 1,000 taels of gold for your painting.

301
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,560
But then that incident with Lanxin happened.

302
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,200
What bad luck.

303
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Madam Gu,

304
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,050
Hanxiu isn't worth those 1,000 taels of gold.

305
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,099
Please let Hanxiu continue to serve you.

306
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,450
What did you say?

307
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,040
Hanxiu is willing to devote all her knowledge

308
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,880
and the rest of her life to the painting studio.

309
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Useless thing.

310
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,960
What do you think my Yanbo Painting Studio is?

311
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,090
Do you think we keep worthless people?

312
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,290
You don't deserve 1,000 taels of gold.

313
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,440
Well, I want to see

314
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,570
what you, Hanxiu, are actually worth.

315
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,120
Madam Gu.

316
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,800
What if I refuse?

317
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,040
You refuse?

318
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Then you'd better think carefully

319
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,160
about what happened to your dear friend Fengling.
