1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,720
Please, master, punish me.

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,759
Punish me.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,720
This is your reward.

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
May I ask what brings you here, miss?

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,520
I'm the owner of the Embroidery Fabric Shop at Tongzhou Market.

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,440
I've come here

7
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,960
to deliver some newly arrived fine silk to Bai Yue

8
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,560
Would you please inform her?

9
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,720
Bai Yue has been unwell lately

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,960
and is resting in her room.

11
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,220
I'm afraid she can't come out to meet you.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,820
However, I can pass the fabric to her.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,780
If that's the case,

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,740
I'll trouble you with it then.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,160
But there's one more thing,

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
I wonder if I might have the honor

17
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,140
of meeting Mr. Wang today?

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,800
You wish to see our master?

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,900
The Tongzhou merchant Zhao Wanyi was my father.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
He has passed away,

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,200
and I now manage all the Zhao family businesses.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,130
Though our families aren't close,

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
we do have business connections,

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,600
so I should have paid my respects earlier.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,840
I've been too busy with affairs

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,770
and haven't had the time until now.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,560
Today I'd like to take this opportunity

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
to meet with Mr. Wang.

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
So you're Miss Zhao.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Please wait a moment,

31
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,250
I'll inform the master right away.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,640
Mr. Wang.

33
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,079
Sorry to intrude.

34
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,120
Miss Zhao, please don't be so formal.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Having you visit today

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,520
truly brightens my humble home.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,890
Please, have a seat.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
Miss Zhao.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,400
I am Cheng Tianci, Cloud Cavalry Officer,

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,520
I've long heard that Miss Zhao

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,840
possesses both grace and exceptional talent.

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,720
Meeting you today,

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,800
your reputation is well-deserved indeed.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
Officer Cheng, you flatter me.

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm just a novice in business,

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
how could I deserve such praise?

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,680
The Zhao family is the elite of merchants in Tongzhou.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,960
Miss Zhao, managing the family business at such a young age,

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,400
truly admirable.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,320
Such beauty and talent,

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,240
whoever marries Miss Zhao

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,920
would be fortunate for life.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,200
You jest.

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,640
Mr. Wang.

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,800
Not knowing what you like on my first visit,

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,740
I've brought a small gift,

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
please accept it.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,050
Miss Zhao, you're too kind.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
In the future,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,800
if you need any assistance with business,

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
just say the word,

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,570
I'll do everything in my power to help.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,940
And myself as well,

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,360
if Miss Zhao needs anything,

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm at your service.

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Though unworthy,

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,000
I have some accomplishments in martial arts.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
I also employ some skilled fighters,

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,420
ensuring no one would dare offend Miss Zhao.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,730
In that case,

71
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,280
I thank you both.

72
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,840
Mr. Wang.

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,000
Actually, my visit today

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,640
comes with a request.

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,079
I wonder if I might meet with your attendant Bai Yue

76
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,960
in person.

77
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,840
He previously came to my fabric shop,

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,720
and we had quite a pleasant conversation.

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,850
I just heard from your steward that he's feeling unwell,

80
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,690
and I'd like to check on him.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,720
Miss Zhao, you're truly beautiful inside and out.

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,800
However, Bai Yue recently

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,920
has been quite ill,

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
and isn't able to receive visitors.

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Please understand, Miss Zhao.

86
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
But rest assured,

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,140
as soon as he recovers,

88
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,560
I'll have him visit you personally.

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,700
If that's the case,

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,000
I won't interrupt your conversation with Officer Cheng any longer.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,060
I'll take my leave.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,880
Take care.

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,560
Miss Zhao

94
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,480
doesn't disturb at all,

95
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
not in the slightest.

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Cavalry Officer.

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Cavalry Officer, have you changed your taste?

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,210
My taste has never changed,

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,960
I just haven't met

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,200
such a perfect woman until now.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,120
She's not from some ordinary family.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,480
The Zhao family is the wealthiest in Tongzhou,

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,000
with extensive connections.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
You shouldn't mess around.

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
Who says I'm messing around?

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,720
I'm still unmarried,

107
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,880
if I marry Miss Zhao,

108
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,880
I'll get both beauty and fortune,

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,480
the best of both worlds.

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,400
Then I wish the Cavalry Officer success.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,440
That Cloud Cavalry Officer looked at the lady

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
with such lecherous eyes,

113
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,960
it was truly disgusting.

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,409
Something doesn't feel right.

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Yue'er,

116
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
go back to the mansion first.

117
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
I'll be back soon.

118
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
Miss, where are you going?

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Today at Wang Pengshu's mansion,

120
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
I met Wang Pengshu

121
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,120
and a Cloud Cavalry Officer named Cheng Tianci.

122
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
After a brief conversation,

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,440
I asked to see Bai Yue.

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,170
But not only did the butler refuse,

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,140
that Squire Wang and Cheng Tianci

126
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,280
immediately changed their expressions

127
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,540
and absolutely refused to let me see him.

128
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Interesting.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
This Bai Yue is just a servant,

130
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,320
why would Wang Pengshu and that officer

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,600
be so nervous about it?

132
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,040
I suspect something has happened to Bai Yue,

133
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,370
or perhaps he's been locked up somewhere.

134
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,560
Then I'll visit Squire Wang's mansion tonight

135
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,960
to find out what's really going on with this Bai Yue.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Come out.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Heaven has its fortune and misfortune, fate has its predetermined course.

138
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,960
This humble Taoist can read fate and see through mysteries.

139
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,600
If you wish to know your fortune, come get a reading.

140
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,050
Wait, young master.

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,960
There's a reddish hue between your brows,

142
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,760
I fear you'll face a bloody calamity soon.

143
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
You mean me?

144
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,040
This humble Taoist never speaks nonsense.

145
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,000
Young master, you've returned from shopping today,

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,159
what should have been a smooth day,

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
but heaven has sent an ominous sign.

148
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,560
A red glow appears,

149
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,440
disaster surely awaits you.

150
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,520
Then tell me

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,620
how I should resolve this?

152
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Young master, please draw a fortune stick.

153
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,780
Young master has such a refined appearance.

154
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,080
Perhaps you're a servant in a wealthy household

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,810
or a personal study companion?

156
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,640
That's right,

157
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,330
you've guessed correctly.

158
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,010
Young master, recently

159
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,720
you must have suffered some physical pain

160
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
that cannot be relieved,

161
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,680
and instead, your wounds have worsened,

162
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,940
becoming unbearable.

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,820
That's truly miraculous.

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,560
Then tell me,

165
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,640
is there any way to resolve this?

166
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,200
Wealth surrounds you,

167
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,140
but danger comes from within.

168
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
The solution to your predicament

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,120
is help from a noble person.

170
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Young master, your destiny is quite unusual.

171
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
There is a calamity in your fate,

172
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
only a noble person can resolve it.

173
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,700
A noble person?

174
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,610
Where is this noble person?

175
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,360
In the northwest, there's a lady from a wealthy family

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,580
who has some connection with you.

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,080
If you can find her,

178
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,720
tell her everything about your situation. Northwest direction.

179
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
Hold nothing back.

180
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,360
She will surely resolve your calamity.

181
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
The noble person,

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,920
could it be Miss Zhao?

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,530
Are you serious about this?

184
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,280
Heaven's will is clear,

185
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,840
how could I jest?

186
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,810
If you don't believe me,

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
you might as well try.

188
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,840
I've finished my part in this play,

189
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,960
now it's up to you how you perform.

190
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Bai Yue.

191
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,160
Sister,

192
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,820
please help me.

193
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
What happened to you?

194
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,480
Get up.

195
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Who did

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
this to you?

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,480
Sister,

198
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
these are just the wounds on my arms,

199
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,010
I have more all over my body.

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,360
Was it Squire Wang?

201
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,480
Bai Yue,

202
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,690
if you don't tell me,

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,280
how can I help you?

204
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,480
If you truly want to escape this misery,

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,440
you need to tell me everything.

206
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,220
It wasn't Squire Wang,

207
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
it was Imperial Guard Cheng Tianci.

208
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
He's a pervert,

209
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
he enjoys

210
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,680
torturing attractive young men and women.

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,840
Squire Wang's business

212
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,640
needs Cheng Tianci's support,

213
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,240
so Wang gave me to him.

214
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,960
Every day

215
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm subjected to his torture.

216
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,680
These beasts.

217
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
Sister, do you know,

218
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,460
I'd rather be dead than alive.

219
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,120
On the surface, I've gained a lot of money,

220
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
but what good is all this money?

221
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,480
I feel

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,760
like I'm

223
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,800
just a captive animal.

224
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,940
Every day I think about ending it all,

225
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,360
but I can't bear to die like this.

226
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Bai Yue,

227
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,440
I will do everything in my power to help you escape.

228
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
But for now,

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,930
you need to endure a little longer.

230
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,700
Thank you, sister.

231
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,120
After hearing all this,

232
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,880
I finally understand

233
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,340
why Squire Wang has been having nightmares.

234
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,760
It seems Cheng Tianci is the key to all this.

235
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
That person you mentioned before,

236
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,970
the missing Yun Lingke,

237
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
must be connected to him as well.

238
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,560
Cheng Tianci,

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,690
Cloud Cavalry Lieutenant.

240
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,880
This Cloud Cavalry Lieutenant is a sixth-rank official.

241
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,410
Though he has no real power,

242
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,500
he still has some local influence

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,610
and several skilled fighters under his command.

244
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,400
The way Squire Wang flatters him

245
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,720
is certainly suspicious.

246
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,880
Bai Yue definitely isn't

247
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,210
the only person Squire Wang has given him.

248
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,800
This Yun Lingke is likely one of them.

249
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,640
I suspect his so-called elopement

250
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,580
is nothing but a cover-up.

251
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,420
If that's the case,

252
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,940
then we need to start our investigation with Cheng Tianci.

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,080
This won't be so simple this time.

254
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Cheng Tianci not only has status,

255
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,120
but his martial skills are formidable,

256
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,850
you must be extremely careful.

257
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I will be careful,

258
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,720
don't worry.

259
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,090
Squire Wang.

260
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,360
That old bastard Shao Heng,

261
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
what has he been up to lately?

262
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,620
Cloud Lieutenant,

263
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,520
that Shao Heng has been behaving himself lately,

264
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
probably because he's lost hope,

265
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,360
he's not worth worrying about,

266
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,160
rest assured.

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,600
He goes crazy like a mad dog whenever he sees the peacock feather.

268
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Just an ordinary object,

269
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,700
I don't know why he's so obsessed with it.

270
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,970
So it's true,

271
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,360
Yun Lingke's disappearance is connected to Cheng Tianci.

272
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Perhaps so.
