1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,700
Shortly after,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,720
I heard someone knock and enter.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,700
They seemed to say something.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,120
It sounded like Mr. Zhao,

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,000
coughing while saying something.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,880
I couldn't hear clearly.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
Maybe because it was stuffy inside,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,880
I fell asleep.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,200
When I woke up again,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
I felt like it was already dark outside.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,800
Just as I was about to push open the cabinet door,

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,040
I heard some scattered noises again.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,400
So I quietly and slowly waited.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,120
After I felt there was no one moving outside,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,660
I pushed the door and came out.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,450
As soon as I came out,

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,920
I saw someone slumped over the table.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,960
When I got closer, I saw the person was dead.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm really scared.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,120
I really wish

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,780
it was me lying there instead.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
I wanted to escape this place immediately.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,720
Just as I reached the door,

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I heard someone approaching again.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,520
I quickly bolted the door

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,810
and barricaded it with a chair.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,050
I looked around the room

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,880
and saw a staircase on the side.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,620
I went up there without a second thought.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Later, I heard the butler say

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
that everyone should gather in the main hall

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,960
because there was something important to announce.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,640
Miss,

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,520
I didn't kill the master,

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,729
it really wasn't me.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
Why aren't you telling the truth?

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,039
I was just scared,

38
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,800
and I really don't know

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
what actually happened.

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,320
I believe

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,479
the authorities will find ways to identify the murderer.

42
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,539
I don't want you to misunderstand me,

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,960
even though I know you don't like me.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,640
Wang Er.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
Why did you come to Tongzhou?

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
I originally lived in Yingtian Prefecture,

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,380
where I ran a small medicine shop.

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,960
My parents passed away years ago,

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,620
leaving only my uncle as my remaining relative.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,320
My uncle lived quite comfortably in Shuntian Prefecture,

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,240
and repeatedly urged me

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,840
to come live with him.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
I rarely go out here,

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,850
so many people haven't seen me before.

55
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Who is your uncle?

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,160
Wang Youshan.

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Wang Youshan.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Miss Zhao, you know him?

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,490
The issue isn't whether I know him,

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
it's that this person disappeared a long time ago.

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,079
Disappeared?

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,320
Wang Er.

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,440
Did your uncle send you to the Zhao mansion?

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Butler Zhang.

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Tell us about your deal with Wang Youshan.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,850
Uncle Zhang,

67
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,620
what kind of deal do you have with him?

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
I can tell you.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,680
Don't say it!

70
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,360
You were sent by Wang Youshan, weren't you?

71
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,240
Isn't the blacksmith shop what you're after?

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,440
Let go of the young lady!

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I'll give you the deed

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
and you and Wang Er can leave.

75
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,810
Uncle Zhang,

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
what do you mean?

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
You killed Master Zhao and Liu Yang.

78
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
Release the young lady.

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Uncle.

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Let the young lady go.

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right,

82
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,640
I am Wang Youshan.

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,880
Wang Er,

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
you useless fool.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
You killed my brother,

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
you killed him,

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
it was you.

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Yue'er,

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,440
what are you saying?

90
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,040
Miss,

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,080
I never meant to hide anything from you.

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,240
I just heard what they were saying,

93
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,780
and only now I understand.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
I didn't know anything before,

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,120
I really didn't.

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
What my brother told me before,

97
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,329
I couldn't make sense of it.

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,440
I didn't understand what he meant.

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,400
Wang Youshan,

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I'll say it again.

101
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Release the young lady,

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,410
Zhang Shuyi.

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Do you really want the truth to come out?

104
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
Ruoting.

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
You all know

106
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
even if you all come at me together,

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,580
you're no match for me.

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Don't waste your effort.

109
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,520
I won't run or fight back.

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,040
I'll give you an answer.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,170
That's for the best.

112
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,040
But I have one request.

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,880
Go ahead.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
The whole story,

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,900
I only want to tell it to the young lady alone.

116
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
I don't want anyone else present.

117
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
All of you, leave.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,080
Chu Bufan,

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,200
you stay.

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,330
I was born in Yingtian Prefecture.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,400
My family was quite wealthy when I was young,

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,720
and we lived without any worries about food or clothing.

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,880
I practiced martial arts from a young age.

124
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,680
My parents arranged a childhood betrothal for me.

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
I had a childhood sweetheart.

126
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,050
We were very devoted to each other.

127
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,520
However,

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,040
tragedy struck.

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,840
When I was 14, thieves broke into our home,

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,700
my parents were murdered,

131
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,080
and I became an orphan overnight.

132
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
I was devastated.

133
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,159
Later, the head of your family took charge of my fate

134
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,840
and sent me to a military camp.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,090
From then on,

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,650
I was separated from Lingling.

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
I lived in the military camp for five years.

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,460
I was exhausted, both physically and mentally,

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
and suffered many injuries.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,860
I wanted to go home to farm the land

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,680
and leave the life of war behind.

142
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I just wanted a simple and peaceful life.

143
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,880
After returning to my hometown,

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
I inquired about your family's situation.

145
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,420
I heard that because of debt, your family

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
had married their daughter to

147
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,380
the Zhao family in Tongzhou, Shuntian Prefecture.

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,720
After much hesitation and with a reluctant heart,

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,260
I packed my belongings and headed north.

150
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,760
After arriving in Tongzhou,

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,570
I first worked at a blacksmith's shop.

152
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,960
In the blink of an eye, three years passed.

153
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,080
Stop right there!

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
One day, I happened to catch a thief

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,320
who was trying to kidnap Young Master Zhao Wanyi from the Zhao mansion.

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,650
I stepped in to save him.

157
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,360
Zhao Wanyi was impressed by my martial skills

158
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,420
and asked me to work as his bodyguard.

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,840
Your fighting skills are exceptional.

160
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
Come work as my bodyguard,

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
the pay is excellent.

162
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,250
From now on, we're friends.

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,300
After I settled in at the mansion,

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,700
one day in the back garden,

165
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,400
I accidentally encountered

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,860
the young mistress reading in the pavilion.

167
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,290
I watched her from a distance for quite some time.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,130
I suddenly realized

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,660
that the young woman before me

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,090
was actually Lingling.

171
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,559
Tears immediately welled up in my eyes

172
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,539
beyond my control.

173
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,570
Just then, the young master came up behind me.

174
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,340
What are you doing here

175
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
young master?

176
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,840
The wind was strong just now

177
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,100
and sand got in my eyes.

178
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,960
They hurt

179
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
but will be fine soon.

180
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,810
Come find me in the main hall later if you're free.

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,570
After being in the mansion for a while,

182
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,280
I heard many servants gossiping

183
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,920
that the young master wasn't good to his wife,

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,650
he was only infatuated with her stunning beauty.

185
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,600
But others said

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,100
that the young mistress was too cold toward him,

187
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,360
which drove him to spend more time carousing outside.

188
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,120
I felt sorry for Linglan.

189
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,900
During my first year here,

190
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,280
I tried my best to avoid meeting her face to face.

191
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,360
But as time went by,

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
I saw everything,

193
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,960
felt the pain in my heart,

194
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,960
and couldn't hold back anymore.

195
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
One night when the young master wasn't home,

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
I went to find Linglan

197
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,160
and revealed my identity to her.

198
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,840
Because Zhao Wanyi was always neglecting his duties,

199
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,600
his parents passed away one after another the following year, filled with resentment.

200
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,400
His daughter

201
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
was also born,

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,680
named

203
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Zhao Ruoting.

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,210
Uncle Zhang,

205
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,240
you shouldn't say such things carelessly.

206
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
His parents passed away, and his wife was cold toward him.

207
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,060
This was indeed a huge blow to Zhao Wanyi,

208
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
and he became bedridden for a while.

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
That's how his health problems began.

210
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,200
The family invited

211
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Doctor Wang Youshan, with whom they had a personal relationship,

212
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,520
to treat him for quite some time.

213
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,080
I was also promoted to the position of head steward in the household.

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
Five more years passed in turmoil.

215
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
During these five years,

216
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,740
Zhao Wanyi showered his daughter with love.

217
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
But for some unknown reason,

218
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,970
his temper suddenly became extremely volatile.

219
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I didn't want to bother him too much,

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,480
just focused on doing my duties properly.

221
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
Then tragedy struck.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,260
The Zhao family fabric shop caught fire.

223
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,090
At that time,

224
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
Linglan happened to be inside.

225
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,920
I was devastated, filled with guilt and unbearable pain.

226
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
The person I most wanted to protect in my life

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,960
was gone just like that.

228
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,040
I truly wanted to follow her in death.

229
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,120
But,

230
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
I couldn't bear to.

231
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I poured all my love

232
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,440
into the young miss.

233
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,320
I hoped she could grow up free and happy.

234
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,320
She looks almost identical to her mother.

235
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,520
So,

236
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,960
I later came to understand Zhao Wanyi's behavior.

237
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,160
Perhaps he felt both love and hatred.

238
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,740
As long as he didn't hurt Ruoting,

239
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,200
I was willing

240
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,280
to keep protecting this family.

241
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
What made you want to kill

242
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,840
Master Zhao?

243
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,560
Time flies like a white colt passing through a crack.

244
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,660
Ruoting turned eighteen.

245
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,440
Zhao Wanyi and I

246
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
had both reached the midpoint of our lives.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,860
Ruoting was extremely cheerful,

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,240
like a bright, warm little sun in our home.

249
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Even when facing the master's unprovoked anger,

250
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,760
she never became disheartened.

251
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,100
She had a pure, kind heart and sunny disposition

252
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,520
toward everyone around her.

253
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,360
All harbor warm and friendly intentions.

254
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,860
Over the past three years,

255
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,000
Zhao Wanyi's health has deteriorated significantly,

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
suffering greatly from insomnia and anxiety.

257
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,480
He frequently experiences stomach pain

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,140
and heart discomfort as well.

259
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
As for me, I have indeed

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,600
planned some profitable ventures in private.

261
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,560
But it was only to save up

262
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,620
more dowry for Ruting, nothing more.

263
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,280
One day a year ago,

264
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,520
I received a secret letter

265
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,760
which stated that

266
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,840
he knew about the secret between Ruoting and me

267
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,450
and had been blackmailing me repeatedly.

268
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,040
I was very curious about who this person behind the scenes was,

269
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,760
but could never find out.

270
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,960
Wang Er was instructed by this mysterious person

271
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,080
to monitor me and put pressure on me.

272
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,260
He insisted that I sign the deed to the blacksmith shop.

273
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
I had never met Lei Lei before.

274
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,560
I suspected

275
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,680
he must be an accomplice of that person behind the scenes

276
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,080
who probably couldn't show his face in public,

277
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
so he sent Lei Lei instead.

278
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,090
If I didn't sign,

279
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,680
he threatened to reveal the young lady's true identity

280
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,840
to everyone.

281
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
And destroy the business I've been secretly running.

282
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,520
I don't care about the money,

283
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,280
I just don't want Ruoting to get hurt.

284
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
Such a secret would be difficult for anyone

285
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,040
to accept, I'm afraid.

286
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,530
After careful consideration,

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,960
the only solution to this problem

288
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,800
was to have the master killed.

289
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,320
Coincidentally, some men in black came to steal two days ago,

290
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
so I planned to kill the master

291
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,860
and frame those men for it.

292
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,160
However,

293
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
things in this world

294
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,560
rarely go exactly as planned.

295
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
Zhang Shuyi.

296
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,530
You're quite the schemer, aren't you?

297
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,180
But as far as I know,

298
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
Zhao Wanyi hasn't done

299
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,520
anything to wrong you, has he?

300
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,520
He killed Linglan.

301
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,060
He's the one who did it,

302
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,080
there's no doubt about that.

303
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Zhang Shuyi,

304
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,740
we will thoroughly investigate who killed Linglan

305
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,360
and give you an explanation.

306
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,960
When and how

307
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
did you kill Master Zhao?

308
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
That was Ghost Tears,

309
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,380
a deadly poison

310
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,240
that dissolves in water,

311
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,860
colorless and tasteless,

312
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,400
causing what appears to be natural death within moments.

313
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
I put it in when I was giving the master water

314
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,120
to take his medicine.

315
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,770
I met the young mistress at the door

316
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,680
and thought

317
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,840
she should see her father one last time.

318
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,760
Should I thank you or hate you?

319
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,660
I still have some unanswered questions,

320
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,360
but they don't matter to me anymore.

321
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,490
You can investigate them yourselves.

322
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,040
What questions?

323
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,200
When Liu Yang and I went to the master's room,

324
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,800
after leaving the second time, I didn't go far.

325
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
Instead, I hid nearby

326
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,200
to secretly observe what was happening inside.

327
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,240
I was also puzzled

328
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,450
why the master wasn't in his room when we entered.

329
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,080
During this time, I saw Lei Lei go in

330
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,740
and then rush out in panic.

331
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,730
Liu Yang and Yue'er came out after him.

332
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,240
At around 4:30 PM

333
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,849
there was no one left in the courtyard.

334
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,160
I went to the master's room again.
