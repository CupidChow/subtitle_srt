1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,960
If you want to live, hand over Su Xiu.

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Mu Di,

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,440
don't forget your place.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Just do what you're supposed to do.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
If you keep stalling,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
I'll have you arrested as a spy,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
and you'll regret it.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Besides, Brother Chu has already given you

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,010
a better offer in exchange.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,600
Don't push your luck.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,159
Mu Di,

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,410
hand over Su Xiu,

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720
and I promise not to cause you any trouble.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,160
Otherwise, today Lin Feng and I...

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,360
Here.

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,560
How are you any different from bandits?

17
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,320
Just as I thought, it's here.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,680
Let's hurry to Yanbo Art Gallery

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,810
and hand over all the evidence to the county magistrate.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,440
Do you know

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,500
this coral pendant is worth 5,000 taels of gold,

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,240
far more valuable than that worthless Su embroidery.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,039
Chu Bufan,

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,120
are you a complete fool?

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,039
Ruoting actually gave something so valuable

26
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,840
to me.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,400
Let's hurry back.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,330
We shouldn't stay here any longer.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,570
Why are you leaving?

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,090
Can't you show some sincerity?

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,479
Who told you to call me a big idiot?

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,540
Everyone, stay alert.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
We cannot afford any mistakes.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,880
We must arrest Ma Renyi and Lady Gu

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,039
and bring them to justice.

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,479
Rest assured, Officer Lin.

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,440
Everyone, follow my orders.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
Move quickly.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Yes, let's go.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,680
Ma Renyi,

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
come with me quietly.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,130
This is no small matter.

43
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,120
You've been acting recklessly because you're the Noble Consort's nephew,

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,480
doing whatever you please.

45
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,200
Besides, does the Noble Consort

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,920
even know about this incident?

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Do you realize what trouble you've caused?

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you want to lose your head?

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,960
While you still have a chance to redeem yourself,

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,290
put down your sword now.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,520
Master Ma,

52
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,360
this isn't what you told me.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,040
Shut up!

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,880
I promised I would protect you,

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,480
and I will keep that promise.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Stop nagging me.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,780
Don't mention anything else.

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,820
If you Imperial Guards want to arrest me,

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
it won't be that easy.

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,160
Hero Chu,

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,960
save me!

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,120
Don't be afraid,

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,650
let's get out of here first.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,920
Yurou.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm so relieved you're safe.

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,040
I thought I'd never see you again.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,680
Sister,

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm fine.

69
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,640
We're finally saved,

70
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,610
no more suffering at the hands of those villains.

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,960
Your Honor,

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,860
I am not responsible for Master Lin's death.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
That night he took a large amount of red lead pills

74
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,760
and suddenly collapsed in front of me.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,120
I never poisoned him.

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,440
When Madam Gu learned about this, she was furious

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,079
and wanted to silence me to cover up the truth.

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,980
I was desperate at that moment

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,880
and had to reveal the secret of Lanxin's fake death

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,280
to save my sister's life.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
It was only then that Madam Gu discovered

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,320
that Lanxin had actually faked her death to escape.

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
Why was Elder Lin's body

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,480
hidden in the secret

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,680
compartment of the painting table?

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,200
That was Madam Gu's idea.

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,400
She temporarily hid

88
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,780
Elder Lin's body in the painting table's compartment.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,320
She planned to move it the next night

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
along with the bones

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,560
under the ancient tree.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,880
However, before she could act,

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
Master Chu arrived with his men.

94
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,770
They dug up the ancient tree roots.

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,440
Sir,

96
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,940
Ma Renyi is the true owner of the painting workshop.

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,440
Madam Gu indeed has extraordinary talent,

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,040
we've been learning from her,

99
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,760
and despite many hardships along the way,

100
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,400
our painting skills have truly improved rapidly.

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
People only know these paintings are exquisite,

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
but behind these artworks

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,520
lie hidden filthy and despicable matters

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,250
who could possibly know about?

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,760
In the painting workshop,

106
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
painters are always

107
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
treated differently based on

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,280
their social backgrounds.

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,810
Those from better families

110
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
with many connections

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
become the workshop's figureheads

112
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
to attract business.

113
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
While those like us without support

114
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,760
are used like penned animals,

115
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
exploited by them

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,159
just to fulfill their

117
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,880
shady interests.

118
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
You can imagine

119
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,280
what kind of life we lead.

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,260
We're worse off than that.

121
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,920
It's my fault for not taking better care of you.

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Madam Gu and Ma Renyi are devils

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,880
who torture us

124
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,409
and deceive us repeatedly.

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,960
We have absolutely no way out.

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,280
If Lanxin hadn't risked her life to escape,

127
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,240
no one would have known the truth.

128
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,560
Madam Gu, Ma Renyi.

129
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
Do you admit your crimes?

130
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,060
For your own selfish gain,

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,410
you abandoned your conscience and harmed innocent people.

132
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,450
This is absolutely unforgivable!

133
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,360
I order

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,970
all artists from Yanbo Painting Studio to be dismissed.

135
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,840
Madam Gu, Ma Renyi,

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,320
your crimes are against both heaven and earth,

137
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
and cannot be pardoned by law.

138
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,690
According to the Ming Dynasty law,

139
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,320
all your property shall be confiscated,

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,960
and you are sentenced to beheading,

141
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,760
to uphold justice and serve as a warning to others.

142
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
This case is now closed.

143
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Court dismissed!

144
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Get up. Let's go.

145
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,010
Magistrate Liu.

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,980
Hero Chu, please wait.

147
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
Hero Chu,

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,520
thank you for seeking justice for me and my sisters

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,440
and retrieving our Suzhou embroidery.

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
What are your plans now?

151
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,440
We're planning to start a small business in Suzhou

152
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
and live a peaceful life from now on.

153
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,220
If we ever have the chance,

154
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,040
we'll certainly repay your kindness.

155
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,480
If you want to thank someone,

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,560
thank Miss Zhao.

157
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,680
Without her help,

158
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
it wouldn't have been so easy to get the embroidery back.

159
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Hero Chu, Miss Zhao,

160
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,020
we will forever remember your kindness.

161
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,960
If you ever come to Suzhou in the future,

162
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,520
please be sure to visit us.

163
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,440
Wait for me!

164
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Official Lin,

165
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,320
why did you let Ma Renyi go?

166
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,080
He's the Imperial Consort's nephew

167
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,880
and holds an official position.

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Magistrate Liu can't deal with him.

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,240
So we're just letting him off?

170
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
Absolutely not!

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,460
For someone who has committed such heinous crimes,

172
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,610
he must first go to the imperial prison

173
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,140
and taste the pain of a fate worse than death.

174
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
I doubt he'll ever get out.

175
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,930
That's satisfying!

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,780
That day, Mu Di said I was a sucker,

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
saying your coral pendant

178
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
is worth 5,000 taels of gold,

179
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
while my life is only worth 10 taels.

180
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
I really don't know

181
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,810
how to repay your kindness worth 5,000 taels.

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Then may I propose an exchange?

183
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,000
No.

184
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,500
How could you be like this?

185
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
You just talked about repaying my kindness,

186
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,480
but now you reject me without even hearing me out,

187
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,810
I'm not asking you to do anything immoral.

188
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,120
Fine.

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,400
Go ahead.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,240
From now on, you call me Ruoting,

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,960
and I'll call you Chu Bufan,

192
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,600
okay?

193
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,450
Brother Chu, Brother Liang

194
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,600
don't leave yet

195
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
something happened to Xiaoqi

196
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
please help us.

197
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,050
What happened? What's wrong with Xiaoqi?

198
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,240
Who hit you?

199
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,240
Tell me

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,010
and I'll beat them to a pulp.

201
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Brother Liang

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,000
Brother Chu

203
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm fine. Sorry to worry you.

204
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm really okay.

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,720
Xiaowu

206
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
don't be afraid.

207
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,960
Look.

208
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm fine,

209
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
I just fell down while walking.

210
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,880
Maybe a bit harder than usual.

211
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Don't worry,

212
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
brothers, don't worry either.

213
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
I'll take good care of Xiao Wu,

214
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,770
and wish you all the best at Shuntian Prefecture.

215
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
Xiao Qi.

216
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,000
Come here.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,120
You're such a sensible child,

218
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,760
but don't hide things from us

219
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
by just pretending to be mature.

220
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,520
If you do that,

221
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,650
how can we leave with peace of mind?

222
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,210
With me and Brother Liang here,

223
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
feel free to tell us anything,

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
so we can help you all.

225
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
Though we can't meet all your needs,

226
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,900
we'll do everything we can

227
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,000
to help with your current difficulties.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,060
For the road ahead,

229
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,840
you'll ultimately have to forge your own path.

230
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,600
Brother Chu.

231
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,920
The hairpin my mother left me is gone.

232
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Was it stolen?

233
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,400
No.

234
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,860
When Little Five was sick,

235
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,640
I desperately needed money,

236
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,080
so I pawned the only keepsake

237
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
my mother left me.

238
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,920
I planned to save enough money to redeem it,

239
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,280
but I got the date wrong,

240
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
and went one day too late.

241
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,700
Someone had already bought the hairpin.

242
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,280
I begged the shopkeeper to help me buy it back,

243
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,240
and offered to pay extra,

244
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
but he said

245
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,360
the buyer paid a lot for it

246
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,700
and left some money for me too.

247
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,690
He said I only needed the money,

248
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,520
while he loved the hairpin,

249
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
so he was willing to pay extra.

250
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,060
But I really don't want to lose it.

251
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
I pleaded with the shopkeeper,

252
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,840
and he finally told me where to find it.

253
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,720
I went there,

254
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,520
but was stopped by guards.

255
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,140
I panicked and bit one of them,

256
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,280
so he hit me.

257
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Brother Chu,

258
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,410
what should I do,

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
what can I do now?

260
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
Is that all?

261
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Look how upset you are.

262
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,640
Are you afraid that Xiao Wu will feel guilty,

263
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,440
so you didn't tell him? Right?

264
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,930
Don't worry,

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,160
your big brother Chu is here,

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I'll definitely get it back for you.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're not going.

268
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
With that stubborn temper of yours,

269
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
you might not solve anything,

270
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,300
and could even make things worse.

271
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,440
Don't worry,

272
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,200
I'll return all his money,

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,970
and bring back the hairpin tomorrow for sure.

274
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,480
Thank you, Brother Chu.

275
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
Please be careful.

276
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,920
I think I should go with you.

277
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,560
No need,

278
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,400
take him to the doctor to get bandaged,

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,060
and then take them out for something good to eat.

280
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
What a luxurious place!

281
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
Can this job be clean?

282
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,920
Let's focus on Xiaoqi's hairpin first.

283
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
No, I'm a hero,

284
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
not a thief.

285
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,300
I met a skilled fighter today,

286
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,730
with skills comparable to palace guards.

287
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,360
This wealthy family is truly extraordinary.

288
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,850
Did you get the hairpin?

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,720
No.

290
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,520
I searched many treasure rooms but couldn't find it.

291
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
If I go again,

292
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,080
it won't be so easy.

293
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,700
They'll definitely increase security.

294
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,840
What bad luck today,

295
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,980
being discovered.

296
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,460
Such a wealthy mansion

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,980
must need many guards.

298
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,090
I'll go check tomorrow,

299
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,890
see if I can apply as a guard,

300
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
then after scouting inside,

301
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,100
I'll bring you information and a map.

302
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,560
That's a good idea,

303
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,080
let's do that.

304
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,280
Be careful,

305
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,420
don't walk alone in the compound.

306
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
This place is unusual.

307
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,040
We'll work from inside and outside,

308
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,320
just find the hairpin

309
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,640
and avoid trouble.

310
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,880
Got it.

311
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,119
Don't worry.
