1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,560
You must be hiding some enormous secret.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,320
Yue'er,

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,200
you've lost your mind.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,660
This could get you killed.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,760
How about I keep

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,560
Master Chu Lin's secret,

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,370
and you teach me kung fu?

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,480
You have family and friends,

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,720
wine and meat,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,890
a peaceful life -

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,400
something countless people desire

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,680
but can never attain.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,500
Why do you always long for a life of violence?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
It's not about violence

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,800
but about upholding justice.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,200
Alas, I was born a woman,

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,080
otherwise I would certainly roam the martial world.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,840
Miss,

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,960
you mustn't say such things.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
You're already living quite a comfortable life,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
how can you still be unsatisfied?

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,200
Yue'er,

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,940
you don't understand.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
If in the future, miss,

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,720
you encounter any trouble you cannot resolve,

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,039
you can take this pouch

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
and give a message to the owner of Ji'an Porridge Shop.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
I might be able to help you.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,900
Opening it now would break the charm.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,120
Yue'er,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,840
please keep this safe for me.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
And no peeking.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,520
Alright.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
I still want to learn some martial arts,

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,840
for myself,

36
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,640
and also to help those in need.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
I hope Master Lin will grant my wish.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,720
How about this,

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,500
I'll give you a riddle,

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
if you can solve it,

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,740
then I'll teach you martial arts.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Let's hear it.

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Lights flicker but no one is seen,

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,760
gloomy feelings with no confidant.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,380
That's not difficult.

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Waves a thousand feet high cross the river,

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,700
bamboo by the thousands bend in the wind.

48
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,020
A bright moon hangs in the sky,

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
the lady and scholar like lotus flowers growing together,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,360
meeting by the emerald pond at dusk,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
reading poetry in silent understanding.

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,480
Good wine for sale.

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,360
I admit defeat.

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,760
Then let me teach you a trick.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,640
Please enlighten me.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,640
Miss.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,810
What do you see outside the window?

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
What is it?

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Go take a look.

60
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,370
What are you looking at?

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,200
Yue'er,

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,240
open the pouch quickly.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,200
But Master Lin just mentioned

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
a traitor.

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Open it now.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,660
Heroes are just good at lying.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
I had no choice.

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,720
Mother, save me.

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,610
I had a nightmare again.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
Child.

72
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,200
Child.

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,520
What child?

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,450
Brother Lin,

75
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,440
I was just looking for you.

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,040
Why are you sweating so much?

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,860
Never mind,

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
I have more urgent matters.

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
We'll discuss the rest later.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's go.

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,160
We found this trading location

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,400
in their registry.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,960
Hurry up.

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,280
They're not real monks.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
We've been staking out for days

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,080
and figured out their trading schedule and patterns.

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
They use the temple's shopping days

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,620
to transport the iron ore.

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
Where do they send it?

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,530
That's exactly what I'm interrogating about today.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,480
You've been following these leads for so long.

92
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
Won't you tip them off?

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,720
No.

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,480
We've taken down Shijia's hidden location,

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
which is a huge loss for them.

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
They're panicking now

97
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,010
and desperate to complete their plan.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,159
We must uncover

99
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,560
their entire operation.

100
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Move it out.

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,580
Be careful.

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Sir,

103
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,890
this might be stolen goods.

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,810
Take it slow.

105
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Caught red-handed.

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,600
Come with me for questioning.

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,720
This one and this one,

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,930
five taels each.

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
All right.

110
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Do you have a large family?

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
Don't buy so much.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
If you buy too much,

113
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,320
it won't taste good after sitting for a day.

114
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Mrs. Lin,

115
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,760
why are you blocking me?

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,490
Don't you see I have customers?

117
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,640
Mrs. Wang.

118
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm not feeling well today,

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,330
could you watch my stall

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,690
while I go home for a bit?

121
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,000
If you're not feeling well,

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,530
you should go home and rest,

123
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,320
why did you leave?

124
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
This meat filling

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
tastes really good.

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,810
You must be tired of the smell of blood,

127
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,420
wanting a change of taste.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
What do I need to do

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,659
for you to leave my family and friends alone?

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
You know the consequences of betrayal.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,460
You're still useful to me.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,360
In 20 days, I have a major plan

133
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,320
will you help me execute it?

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,210
After it's done,

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,160
I want out.

136
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,120
Suo Yun,

137
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
have you forgotten

138
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,250
the humiliation and suffering you once endured?

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
As long as you're alive,

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
there's no way out.

141
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,040
Before my masterpiece is complete,

142
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,520
go back to your husband

143
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,760
and give him false information

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,690
about the mineral trade location.

145
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,360
What if I refuse?

146
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Then I'll kill

147
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,679
everyone you love,

148
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,120
everyone you know,

149
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,040
and turn them into filling like this.

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Don't forget

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,080
what blood runs through your veins.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,160
If you forget,

153
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
I'll make you remember.

154
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,900
I didn't expect you'd come today.

155
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,080
Where's your maid?

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,080
She needs to cover for me at home.

157
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
Although my father doesn't restrict me much,

158
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
he still doesn't like me going out all the time.

159
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,600
Thank you.

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
So on the surface,

161
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
I can't let him find out.

162
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,680
Do you come here every 15th of the month?

163
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,480
Yes.

164
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,920
Thank you.

165
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm quite familiar with Ji'an, the owner here.

166
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,620
You didn't know that, did you?

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,440
Thank you.

168
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
Last time you mentioned Ji'an Porridge Shop too.

169
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,380
Are you also familiar with it?

170
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,280
Good friends.

171
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,040
Thank you.

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,780
I've been struggling with something

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,060
but I don't know how to make a decision

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,170
I'd like to ask for your advice.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,730
Tell me about it.

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Your friend's wife has a secret

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,480
that you accidentally discovered,

178
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,280
but your friend has no idea about

179
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,040
this secret.

180
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,720
And it's related to the case

181
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,250
you're investigating now.

182
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Professionally speaking,

183
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,460
you think you should tell him.

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,440
Personally,

185
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,960
you think you shouldn't.

186
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,360
So what do you think

187
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,220
would be the appropriate action?

188
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,480
How can I pass on the information

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,600
without damaging their marriage?

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
I think

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
you should just tell me

192
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,960
what you're investigating.

193
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
That makes sense,

194
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,610
it would indeed be easier to analyze that way.

195
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,600
Exactly,

196
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
I knew you were a reasonable man.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,330
I'll go check how much porridge is left in the kitchen today.

198
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,850
You look so beautiful, sister.

199
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
He ran away again.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,280
It's only been a short while since we last met,

201
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,140
and you already miss me this much.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
It's not that I don't want to tell you about this matter,

203
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,480
it's that I don't know the full picture myself.

204
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,400
But right now,

205
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,530
Look at Brother Chu.

206
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,690
I really do need Miss Ruoting's guidance on this matter.

207
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,280
Since you're being so sincere,

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
I'll tell you

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,760
how you should better phrase it.

210
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,640
Master.

211
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,280
We've lost our trading spot at the temple,

212
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,840
it was the Imperial Guard's doing.

213
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,520
The goods at this trading spot are crucial,

214
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,320
they're our highest purity batch of ore this time.

215
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
It seems

216
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,540
we'll have to go there ourselves.

217
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,280
Feng.

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,080
Feng.

219
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,800
Stay safe.

220
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,840
Stay safe.

221
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,440
My dear,

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
why are you home so early?

223
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,090
Where have you two been?

224
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,720
Ping'an has a bit of a rash,

225
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
so I took him to get some medicine,

226
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,380
it's nothing serious.

227
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,100
I'll brew the medicine for you later.

228
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
Who are you?

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Captain Lin,

230
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I am the one you've been looking for,

231
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,280
the mastermind behind the ore smuggling operation,

232
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,740
Li Haifeng, leader of the Golden Knife Gang.

233
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,250
Yesterday you seized my goods,

234
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
killed my men,

235
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,960
forcing me to pay you a visit.

236
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Since you're being so forthcoming,

237
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,520
will you come with me willingly,

238
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,360
or do I have to tie you up?

239
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,880
Let's see if you have what it takes.

240
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,440
My dear,

241
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
protect Ping'an.

242
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,120
My love.

243
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,160
My love.

244
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I'll hold him off.

245
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,280
Li Haifeng's martial arts are unfathomable,

246
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,200
but none of his moves are lethal.

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,660
He's not here for Lin Feng.

248
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,220
He can't wait for the Imperial Guards to arrive.

249
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,280
Ping'an.

250
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,080
Mommy wants to play hide and seek with you.

251
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Cover your eyes,

252
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,410
don't be afraid.

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,960
My dear.

254
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,200
Let's settle this once and for all today.

255
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,720
Make it quick.

256
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
Mother, save me!

257
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,440
Ping'an! Mother!

258
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,120
Ping'an!

259
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
Ping'an! Mother, help me!

260
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,400
Mother, save me!

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,680
Stop shouting!

262
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,720
Mother, save me!

263
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Take him away.

264
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,840
Mother, save me! Mother!

265
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,370
Ping'an!

266
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,640
Mother!

267
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,440
Don't go.

268
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,320
It's useless.

269
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,800
What's your relationship with them?

270
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,720
My dear, can you tell me

271
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,760
what's going on?

272
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,760
Why are they targeting Ping'an?

273
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
My dear, please stop crying.

274
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,360
We need to find a way to rescue our child first.

275
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Do you know where they've taken him?

276
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
It's all my fault.

277
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,610
I've brought harm to you and our child.

278
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,020
It's all because of me.

279
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
My dear.

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,400
My dear.

281
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,800
Calm down first.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm not blaming you.

283
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
This isn't your fault.

284
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,240
They were after me.

285
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,700
Because recently I...

286
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,560
But why do you know them too?

287
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,920
Say something.

288
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,770
What exactly happened?

289
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,050
Who trashed our home like this?

290
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,340
Where's the child?

291
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,160
Lin.
