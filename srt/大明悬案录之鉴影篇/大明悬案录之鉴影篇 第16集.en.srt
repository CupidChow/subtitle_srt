1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,040
It should be in Linglong Valley.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,330
I didn't find anything,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,200
I don't know.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,920
Xiao Jia,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,680
Li,

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
you two stay here,

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,480
everyone else must remain

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,960
and wait here.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,080
Chu Bufan.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Constable Li.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,780
You choose this exact moment to come to the Zhao residence,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,060
are you here to destroy evidence?

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Constable Li, you jest.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,290
I'm Miss Ruoting's friend,

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,280
and heard about the incident at her home,

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,410
so I came to check on her out of concern.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,660
You come at this particular time,

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,850
aren't you afraid of being suspected?

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,760
How did you get in?

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,330
I entered openly and properly,

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,800
nothing inappropriate about it.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,400
That's not for you to decide.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,920
Chu Bufan.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,160
Your sneaking into the Zhao residence to investigate this case

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,420
is highly suspicious.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,520
Whether you're involved in the Zhao family matter or not,

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,320
you'll need to come with us and explain yourself.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,160
Don't think that just because

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,800
you've helped with two cases before

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
you can prove your innocence.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,479
Who knows if you have ulterior motives

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,240
or other schemes?

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,060
The Zhao family case has wide implications,

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,120
which is why we're investigating it secretly,

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,250
yet you've rashly involved yourself.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,200
Chu Bufan,

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,880
why do you show up everywhere?

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,320
Sir Li,

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
I have absolutely no intention to harm anyone,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
please investigate thoroughly.

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Then come with me to the hall and explain yourself.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Young Master Chu.

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
We've met before.

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Steward Zhang, your memory is impressive.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,760
Last time when Lin Feng and I visited your shop,

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
we only met briefly.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Indeed.

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
The Stone Jia incident had far-reaching consequences.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
I still vividly remember

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,620
your exceptional intelligence.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,960
However, I'm curious about

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,440
why you sneaked into the Zhao mansion a few nights ago.

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Could it be that our household has some secrets

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,760
that required your secret investigation?

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,920
But you don't have such authority, do you?

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Officer Li.

57
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
What do you think?

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,520
Chu Bufan,

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,890
you broke into the Zhao mansion twice.

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,180
Is Master Zhao's death connected to you?

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
Tell me the truth.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Constable Li.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,440
I swear,

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,480
I have absolutely nothing to do with Master Zhao's death.

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
Chu Bufan,

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,520
where were you and what were you doing the night the master died?

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,600
What did you see?

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,060
If you dare hide anything,

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,360
you should know that just for breaking into the Zhao mansion,

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,290
I can charge you with a crime today.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,440
How did you know there was a secret room inside?

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
I told him about it.

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,760
Oh, you.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
You and your

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Chu Bufan,

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,520
could my father's death be connected to you?

77
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,800
Ruoting,

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
I promise you,

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,680
we had absolutely nothing to do with it.

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm here to help you.

81
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,800
Chu Bufan,

82
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,200
you even sent in a spy.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,330
You've been planning this for a long time.

84
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,340
Qi Ming is a guard in this mansion.

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,800
So is Liu Yang's death

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
also connected to you?

87
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,920
I planned all of this by myself.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,880
I was the one who asked Chu Bufan for help,

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,680
and this favor

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,920
has nothing to do with anyone or anything

91
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,980
in this household.

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm willing to take full responsibility,

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,500
and I hope you will consider this fairly.

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,450
Explain everything in detail.

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
If you dare hide anything else...

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I will charge you with a crime today.

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
I usually

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,720
get along well with the little beggars on the street.

99
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
I look after them occasionally.

100
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,880
They're all homeless children with miserable lives.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,940
Just a few days ago,

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,960
Xiaoqi came to me and told me.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
The hairpin his mother left him

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,720
couldn't be found.

105
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,159
After asking for details, I learned

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,880
that Master Zhao from the Zhao household

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,010
had bought the hairpin for a large sum.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,840
I suspect

109
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
he gave it to Miss Yue'er.

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,760
Miss,

111
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,080
I really don't know anything about this matter.

112
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,880
Xiao Qi once came to the Zhao residence looking for it,

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,480
but was severely beaten by Liu Yang, the guard.

114
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,200
My martial skills are inferior to yours, Brother Chu,

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
that's why I'm asking for your help.

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,280
When I first came to the Zhao residence,

117
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,640
I was overwhelmed by the size of this mansion.

118
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,520
Because the compound is extremely complex,

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,840
I searched for a long time

120
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,200
but couldn't find any trace of the hairpin.

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,880
Later, I discussed with Qi Ming

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,200
to have him come investigate

123
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,080
in order to retrieve that hairpin.

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,000
You stole a hairpin

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,330
and you're making it sound so reasonable?

126
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
Sir, please don't misunderstand.

127
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,760
You can send someone

128
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,159
to Master Zhao's room and see for yourself.

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,640
I've returned all of Master Zhao's money,

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
taking only that hairpin.

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,640
We don't want to cause any more trouble.

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,760
I hope Your Excellency Li can be magnanimous

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
and forgive our mistakes this time.

134
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,200
So what else

135
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,240
did you see that night?

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
To be honest,

137
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
I do feel somewhat guilty

138
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,960
and blame myself for being too careless,

139
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
failing Ruoting,

140
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,700
which is why I've returned to the Zhao residence today.

141
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,280
That night,

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,400
I did notice someone lying on the table.

143
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,400
I thought it was the effect of the knockout smoke,

144
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,480
so I quickly left.

145
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,700
Just as I stepped into the courtyard,

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
I ran into Steward Zhang.

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,090
He didn't try to stop me.

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,840
Steward Zhang seemed unusually calm.

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
Chu Bufan.

150
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
What evidence do you have

151
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,840
that you didn't kill the master?

152
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,080
You claim you only used sleeping powder

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,360
and fled after the theft.

154
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,420
Steward Zhang,

155
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,890
why are you determined to frame me?

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,040
Our actions were indeed inappropriate,

157
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,080
but we only wanted to avoid trouble.

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,420
Because your Zhao household is too vicious,

159
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,320
our Xiaoqi was beaten by your people.

160
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,880
So to avenge Xiaoqi,

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
you killed Guard Liu?

162
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
Nonsense!

163
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,810
Silence, all of you!

164
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,420
It's not up to you to decide what matters.

165
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Chu Bufan

166
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,400
when did you arrive at the Zhao residence

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
and when did you leave?

168
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,240
When I arrived at Master Zhao's room

169
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
it was around 8 p.m.,

170
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,220
and I stayed for less than 15 minutes.

171
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
After you arrived at the Zhao residence today,

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
where did you go?

173
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
I was at Linglong Garden the whole time,

174
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,360
never left.

175
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,100
What about you?

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,200
Sir,

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,480
the situation in the residence is complicated now,

178
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,680
we strictly follow the patrol schedule

179
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,000
and dare not move around freely.

180
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,280
Chu Bufan,

181
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,280
both of you go outside first

182
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,610
and wait to be summoned.

183
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,960
Mr. Zhang.

184
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,480
You know the situation in this household better than anyone,

185
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,720
so please tell us

186
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,840
about what happened yesterday.

187
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,960
Every morning, I first visit the master

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
and then listen to the servants' reports

189
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,770
about the Zhao family businesses.

190
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,080
The master hasn't been well lately,

191
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
when he saw me yesterday, he mentioned

192
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
he was suffering from insomnia again

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
along with a cough.

194
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
I chatted with him for a while,

195
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,210
he had a bowl of noodles,

196
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
took his medicine and went to sleep.

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,460
What medicine?

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Was it sleeping medicine?

199
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,780
Yes, it was.

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
The master had just woken up

201
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
when the young lady and Yue'er arrived.

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,620
I didn't let them disturb the master,

203
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,220
I received them first.

204
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,160
Then came merchant Lei Lei, who had arranged earlier to discuss with the master

205
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,400
about purchasing the blacksmith shop.

206
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Due to the master's illness,

207
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,600
the contract had been delayed and remained unsigned.

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Later, a servant came in to inform me

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
that someone else was at the door looking for me.

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,580
So I arranged for Liu Yang to attend to Merchant Lei.

211
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That person who was looking for you,

212
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,200
was that your relative, Wang Er?

213
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,410
Are you sure you've met him before?

214
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
No, I haven't.

215
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,010
I haven't returned to my hometown for many years.

216
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,840
But we've occasionally exchanged letters.

217
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,440
This time there's a famine in my hometown,

218
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,120
and my family knows

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,000
I've been doing quite well at the Zhao household,

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,130
so they sent him to seek refuge with me.

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Mr. Zhang.

222
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,240
Are you certain

223
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,530
that he is actually your relative?

224
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,120
What do you mean by that, sir?

225
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,720
Aren't you afraid

226
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,120
that he might be a con man?

227
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,330
That's impossible.

228
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
Captain, you must be joking.

229
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,920
You can tell he's timid,

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,650
too scared to tell big lies.

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,280
Yue'er,

232
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,920
you're hurting me.

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,410
Don't be afraid.

234
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,060
Steward Zhang.

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
Go on.

236
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,580
I brought him into the mansion

237
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
and met the young lady in the garden.

238
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
After settling him in his quarters,

239
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,210
he followed me to the main hall.

240
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,560
Just then, Yue'er came by with a food box.

241
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,320
She told me the master wanted to rest longer

242
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,080
and that any matters should wait until he woke up in the afternoon.

243
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,920
So all morning,

244
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,920
we didn't disturb the master.

245
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
Around 1:15 in the afternoon,

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,440
I thought the master should be awake by then,

247
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,770
so I wanted to ask him what he'd like to eat.

248
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,200
I knocked on his door,

249
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,730
and after a while, the master called me in.

250
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
I saw a food box on the table,

251
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,480
and the master was sitting on the bed eating pastries.

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,000
I thought I should first mention

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the matter of Merchant Lei's visit.

254
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
The master actually became angry.

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
I won't sell the shop.

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,400
Don't you know

257
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,260
what kind of business they're in?

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,960
Master,

259
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,200
we've discussed this matter so many times.

260
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Why are you back to where we started?

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Selling it won't have any impact.

262
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,480
It won't damage

263
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
the Zhao family's assets or income.

264
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,600
Moreover,

265
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
the blacksmith shop's business

266
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,850
isn't that profitable anyway.

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,930
Besides, times are turbulent now,

268
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,290
we keep running into suspicious matters,

269
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,360
which could actually affect us negatively.

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,020
We already let someone like Shi Jia infiltrate,

271
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,880
secretly trafficking iron ore.

272
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
This isn't just about a few taels of silver,

273
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,320
it's a matter of national security!

274
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,120
Then I definitely can't sell it,

275
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,440
I can't be an accomplice to evil.

276
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,690
As if you're such a good person.

277
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
What are you mumbling about?

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,280
Nothing... nothing.

279
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,210
Please don't be angry, sir.

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll have a proper talk with Merchant Lei later,

281
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,440
so we don't make enemies, right?

282
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
Let me handle this.

283
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,360
Sir,

284
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,600
after you've eaten these cakes,

285
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,180
please take your medicine and get some rest.

286
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,280
I poured water for the master and handed him his medicine.

287
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,640
After watching the master take his medicine,

288
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,100
I closed the door and left.

289
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,410
I met the young lady at the door.

290
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,480
I thought since the master had just taken his medicine,

291
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
he probably wasn't asleep yet,

292
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,760
so I told her she could go see him.

293
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,800
Later I met Liu Yang,

294
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,560
who said he needed to speak with the master,

295
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
so I went along with him.

296
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,840
When you met the young lady,

297
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,520
it was about a quarter to noon,

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
and when you met Liu Yang, it was about a quarter past noon.

299
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,170
So where were you during that time?

300
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Since the master changed his mind about signing the contract,

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,730
I was feeling rather troubled,

302
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,880
so I took a walk in the courtyard.

303
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
I was still thinking about persuading the master.

304
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,770
You and Liu Yang couldn't get the master to open the door,

305
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,360
and you said you'd go get medicine first,

306
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,560
but when you returned, you still couldn't see the master.

307
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,810
Then you said you'd go look for him,

308
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,120
and never came back after that.

309
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,640
No.

310
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,360
I searched all over the estate

311
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
but couldn't find the master anywhere.

312
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,420
I thought perhaps the master had already returned,

313
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
and since Liu Yang needed to discuss something with him,

314
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,420
I didn't go back there.

315
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Because for most of the day,

316
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
I was attending to people in the household,

317
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,320
and the shop matters were set aside,

318
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
still unchecked.

319
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,240
Moreover, I was feeling quite tired,

320
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,210
so I went back to my room to rest.

321
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,640
When I woke up, it was getting dark,

322
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,760
and the servants had already left dinner at my door.

323
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,400
I suppose

324
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,010
I must have slept for quite a while.

325
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,360
You encountered a thief while patrolling the estate,

326
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,760
yet you weren't alarmed,

327
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,400
and you didn't immediately

328
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,720
go check on the master.

329
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
Why is that?

330
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,410
I had seen him a few days before,

331
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,640
so yesterday I thought he had just entered

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,840
and fled in fear after seeing me.

333
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,600
I didn't know he had already stolen something.

334
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,240
The reason I didn't stop him

335
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,520
was because I recognized him as Chu Bufan.

336
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,010
I was curious about his intentions

337
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,960
and didn't want to scare him off.

338
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,640
Manager Zhang, you're quite the schemer, aren't you?

339
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Wang Er.

340
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,340
What are you afraid of?

341
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Don't tell me

342
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,650
you killed this person?

343
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,920
You've been in Tongzhou for over three months now.

344
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,260
Are you sleepwalking?

345
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,160
Where did you

346
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
see Miss Zhao before?

347
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,020
When I first arrived in Tongzhou,

348
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,520
I saw the young lady performing heroic deeds.

349
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Being a hero and upholding justice.

350
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,880
A kidnapped child.

351
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,210
You're feeling guilty,

352
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,240
so you don't dare to go.

353
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,320
I've been watching you for a long time.

354
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,240
You, woman,

355
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,440
hiding in the alley every day to spy on children.

356
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,600
I've long discovered your evil intentions.

357
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,760
I'm going to interfere in this matter.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,640
That day

359
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,450
she was especially beautiful.

360
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,580
She was particularly beautiful.

361
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,040
So she had you completely mesmerized, huh?

362
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
Do you know your own capabilities?

363
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,920
Don't you have any self-awareness?

364
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
You still dare to lie.

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Sir.

366
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm actually not related to Steward Zhang.

367
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,720
I was just sent here

368
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,200
to keep an eye on him.

369
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,760
I don't even know what I'm watching for.

370
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,210
They just told me

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
to stay by his side at all times.

372
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,360
That's why I've been wandering around the courtyard.

373
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
And I never expected

374
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,490
to run into the young miss here.

375
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,240
Wang Er.

376
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,960
Tell us honestly about all the details

377
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
you've been hiding.

378
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,400
When I first arrived,

379
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,760
I gave Steward Zhang a letter.

380
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Uncle.

381
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,140
I've been really nervous and scared.

382
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm just an assistant from a medicine shop.

383
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,600
Until

384
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,780
I saw the young lady in the garden,

385
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
then I wasn't so afraid anymore.

386
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,210
After I entered the master's room,

387
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,480
I actually didn't leave.

388
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
You didn't leave?

389
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,040
Not until

390
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
after Chu Bufan left,

391
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,440
did I come out.

392
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,880
What were you doing in there?

393
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,569
What did you see or hear?

394
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,160
I was just curious about what

395
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,369
could make the young lady so angry.

396
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
When I looked closer,

397
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
I saw fresh bloodstains.

398
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
I was terrified,

399
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,000
so I rushed to get out.

400
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,240
Just as I reached the door, through the crack

401
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,480
I saw someone coming.

402
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,120
I-I was so scared I locked the door

403
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,520
and quickly hid in the wardrobe.

404
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,380
Shortly after,

405
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,560
I heard someone knock and enter.

406
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
They seemed to say something.
