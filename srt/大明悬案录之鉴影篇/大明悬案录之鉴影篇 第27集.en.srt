1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,160
Mr. Shao

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,040
your Peacock Feather might not be recoverable.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,840
But I've found

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,920
the real murderer of Yun Lingke.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,560
This is Yun Lingke's costume.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Mr. Shao.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
Now we just need to go to the county office together to report this injustice,

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,340
and we'll surely get justice for you.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,360
I believe what you truly want

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,560
is to clear your name,

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,360
not the Peacock Feather.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Thank you, Young Master Chu.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,200
Thank you, Young Master Chu.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,560
Shao Heng,

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,519
you've accused Cheng Tianci and Wang Pengshu

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,320
of plotting against Yun Lingke.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,660
Present your evidence immediately.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,120
Your Honor,

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,960
this is the costume worn by the missing person Yun Lingke

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
before his disappearance.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,080
It originally had peacock feathers attached to it,

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,340
but they were removed.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,880
And this item was found in Cheng Tianci's residence.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,800
Cheng Tianci.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920
How do you explain this?

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,520
Your Honor.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,720
How could I not know this item was in my residence?

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,120
If it was found in my home,

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,890
someone must be framing me.

30
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,539
Who is this person?

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
I have yet to find out.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,759
Your Honor.

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,320
I can testify.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,960
The theatrical costume was indeed kept at Cheng Tianci's residence.

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Not only that,

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
his secret chamber contained various torture instruments.

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,250
That beast Cheng Tianci

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,160
tortured me repeatedly with hot irons and other cruel methods,

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,620
making me wish I were dead.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,199
He imprisoned others in his secret chamber too.

41
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,160
I saw with my own eyes

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,800
people who were taken into that chamber

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
and never came out again.

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,490
And before that,

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
he used the same methods

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,240
to torture Yun Ling to death.

47
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,680
Who knows how many

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,800
young men and women in their prime

49
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,320
have been destroyed by your beastly hands.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,720
Cheng Tianci,

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,480
when you brought men to silence witnesses last night,

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,240
I left a dagger wound on your right leg.

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,400
Do you dare to show it in court?

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Cheng Tianci,

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
what do you have to say for yourself?

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,840
Your Honor,

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
this Achun is working with them.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
His words cannot be trusted.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,680
This wound was accidentally caused during sword practice yesterday,

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,610
it has nothing to do with this case.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Then why

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,730
do I know the exact location of your wound?

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,960
Are we close friends?

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,120
Get to work now!

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,880
The magistrate ordered

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,340
that everything must be burned completely.

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,760
By order of the county magistrate,

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm here to search for evidence.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,040
Anyone attempting to destroy evidence

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,160
will be severely punished.

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
Constable Li, follow me.

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
Brother Chu has already told me

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,620
where that item is.

74
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Your Honor,

75
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,810
Wang Pengshu's servant Bai Yue is willing to testify

76
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
that he was once in a secret room at the Cheng residence

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
where Cheng Tianci tortured him severely.

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
Please help this humble citizen, Your Honor,

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,400
the scars on my body can serve as evidence.

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Your Honor,

81
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,650
I've brought important evidence.

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,560
This was found in Cheng Tianci's residence,

83
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,160
discovered during a search of the secret room.

84
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,060
Your Honor,

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,520
may I take a look?

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,240
Sir

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,420
these black fragments

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,360
are indeed the burned peacock feathers.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Master Shao's repeated reports

90
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,760
weren't to recover the peacock feathers,

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,420
but to seek justice for his beloved apprentice.

92
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,280
Master Shao.

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,760
I was a coward,

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
afraid they would silence me permanently,

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,640
too scared to report Cheng Tianci and Wang Pengshu

96
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,320
for murdering my apprentice.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,200
I could only pretend to be looking for the peacock feathers,

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
while actually seeking an excuse

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,000
to expose these beasts' evil deeds to the authorities.

100
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,200
Sir,

101
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,159
I have nothing to do with this matter,

102
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,080
it was all Cheng Tianci's doing.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,880
I was forced against my will,

104
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,810
please consider this, Your Honor.

105
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,440
Cheng Tianci, Wang Pengshu,

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
you two have conspired together

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
to harm innocent people.

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,300
The ashes in this jade dish are evidence enough.

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,730
What's even more absurd

110
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
is that you both worship evil spirits

111
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,520
and foolishly believe dark magic can protect you.

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
You are both ignorant and shameless,

113
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
truly unforgivable.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
By my order,

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,440
take Cheng Tianci and Wang Pengshu to prison,

116
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,170
remove them!

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,490
Thank you for your wisdom, Sir.

118
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,160
Sir, I've been wronged!

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,240
Thank you for your justice, Sir.

120
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,640
Thank you, Sir.

121
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,560
Master Chu.

122
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,890
These 700 taels in bank notes are the final payment I owe you.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
Now that Yun Lingke's case

124
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,409
has finally been resolved.

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,920
This is the reward you deserve.

126
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,280
Master Shao.

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,130
I cannot accept this money.

128
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
You've kept this theater troupe going all these years,

129
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,730
which hasn't been easy.

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Master Chu.

131
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
If you don't accept it,

132
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,200
my conscience won't be at peace.

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,200
If it weren't for you,

134
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,080
this case would

135
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,560
never have been solved.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
These old bones of mine

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
would have no reason to keep living.

138
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Isn't teaching and passing on knowledge meaningful enough?

139
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,160
For solving this case,

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,080
the magistrate has already given me a reward.

141
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm quite content with that.

142
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,960
You and the Chunqiu Troupe

143
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,720
need this money more than I do.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,800
I've performed countless operas in my lifetime.

145
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,080
I've played many heroes.

146
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,560
I always thought that honor among men

147
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,200
was just fiction from storybooks.

148
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,280
Until I met you,

149
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,700
I never truly understood the meaning of chivalry and righteousness.

150
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Thank you for your praise, Master Shao.

151
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
I will keep your words in my heart

152
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
and uphold the code of chivalry,

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,159
being strict with myself.

154
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,800
No matter what obstacles I face,

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
I will press forward bravely,

156
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,160
not disappointing your expectations nor dishonoring the name of a hero.

157
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
This resolve will never change.

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,740
Why are you crying?

159
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,960
Ji'an.

160
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Here's 200 taels.

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,520
Take it.

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,820
Take good care of yourself

163
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,040
and the children too.

164
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,540
Please visit Little Five and Little Seven for me often.

165
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,880
This reunion

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
lasted longer than planned,

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,210
but it's given me peace of mind.

168
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,480
Brother Chu,

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,580
I can't accept this money.

170
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
You'll need it for your journey.

171
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
There will be many expenses.

172
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,080
I can't help share more of your burden,

173
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,760
I already feel so guilty and ashamed.

174
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,280
Don't blame yourself.

175
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,520
No one could have done better than you.

176
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,920
You'll always be our dearest little Ji'an.

177
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,170
I'm leaving.

178
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,520
Are you

179
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,380
really leaving this time?

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,490
With this farewell,

181
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,050
you must take good care of yourself

182
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
and don't worry about us.

183
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,919
The path ahead of us is filled with thorns,

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and who knows when we'll meet again.

185
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,760
Take care.

186
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,169
Don't see us off.

187
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,840
Hurry back to your porridge shop.

188
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Brother Chu,

189
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,560
when will the government reward be paid?

190
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Even 1,000 taels would be good.

191
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
You're always deceiving me,

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
making me lose money on deals.

193
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,480
One shouldn't be too greedy in life.

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Brother Chu.

195
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,700
Brother Liang.

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,920
I'll always be here

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,740
waiting for you to return.

198
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,700
Please take good care of yourselves.

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,440
Chu Bufan.

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,980
This time I'm really leaving.

201
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Hurry up!

202
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Once I leave,

203
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,490
who knows when we'll see each other again.

204
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
If it's meant to be, we'll meet again.

205
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,850
You're lying again.

206
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Why so sad?

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,690
Tongzhou may be big,

208
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,900
but we always managed to run into each other.

209
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
But this time,

210
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm afraid we might never see each other again.

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,960
Meeting or not meeting,

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
it's all part of life's destiny.

213
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,280
Sometimes,

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,320
seeing each other isn't the only way to express our feelings.

215
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,450
Between these meetings and partings,

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,560
we've learned to grow and cherish what we have,

217
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
haven't we?

218
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
I know

219
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,080
you have important things to do.

220
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,680
I don't know if I should say certain things.

221
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,540
You understand me,

222
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
and I understand you,

223
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,620
just like Sister Yun understands me.

224
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
I still want to say it.

225
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
When we first met,

226
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,240
I thought we were a perfect match.

227
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
But then,

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
my life took an unexpected turn.

229
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,010
I felt I was no longer worthy of you.

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
But I could feel

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
that you never looked down on me.

232
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,400
That's how fate works,

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,560
we met the right person

234
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,840
at the wrong time.

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,620
We can't force things.

236
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,800
Having met you

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
is enough for me.

238
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
May everything go well for you

239
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,500
and may you find peace and joy.

240
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,480
Ruoting.

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,180
You're wonderful.

242
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,530
You've always been wonderful,

243
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
never letting external circumstances

244
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,120
change your true nature.

245
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,780
All the hardships you've endured

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,040
are, to me,

247
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,960
nothing but cruel twists of fate,

248
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
not flaws within yourself.

249
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,780
How could the ups and downs of life

250
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
ever easily define

251
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,540
what we mean to each other?

252
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,780
Though time may be chaotic now

253
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,280
and the path rough,

254
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
your place in my heart

255
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
remains irreplaceable.

256
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
I also wish that your future

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,690
will be filled with happiness.

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,760
This is my gift to you.

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
Open it after I'm gone.

260
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,920
Chu Bufan,

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,260
no matter where you are

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,760
or what you do,

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,480
I hope you'll stay true to yourself

264
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
and do what you really want to do.

265
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,920
Ruoting,

266
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,760
be happy

267
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,610
and take good care of yourself.

268
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,680
Take care.

269
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,280
Take care.

270
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,370
Brother Chu,

271
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
she's gone now.

272
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,410
Let's get going too.

273
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,360
Ruoting.

274
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,200
Having someone to talk to is already a great blessing.

275
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,640
But in life,

276
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,340
wherever there are choices, there will be regrets.

277
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,940
I have important matters to attend to

278
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,100
and cannot accompany you.

279
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,650
I only hope we both find our own happiness.

280
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Goodbye,

281
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Ruting.
