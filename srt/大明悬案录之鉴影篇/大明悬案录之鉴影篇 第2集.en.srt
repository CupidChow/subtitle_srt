1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm just trying to buy a suitable weapon for self-defense,

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
why are you giving me such a hard time?

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,760
Why don't we

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,770
pretend we never met today,

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
and nothing ever happened,

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,180
what do you say?

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,160
Chu Bufan,

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,980
if you're innocent, I won't make things difficult for you.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
But even if you're not an accomplice,

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,770
you're still the only witness to Shi Jia's death.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,760
This case concerns national security and public safety,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,690
I can't let a key witness go easily,

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,420
you must cooperate with our investigation.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,560
Fine.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,460
I see how things stand now,

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
that's quite a serious accusation you're making.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,240
But I still hope you can trust me,

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,569
I'll definitely cooperate actively.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,160
I have a small suggestion.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,080
Look,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
instead of just cooperating,

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,410
we could work together.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,570
I can actively investigate this case.

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,610
I believe there's more to this case

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
than meets the eye.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm willing to contribute my abilities

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,200
to help solve this case quickly,

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,200
and clear my name,

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,860
so I can regain my freedom.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,740
You're quite good at making excuses.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,050
I might consider letting you help.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
But right now

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,720
you're not on my list of trusted people.

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
Don't wander around these days,

35
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,759
give us your current address,

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
and I'll notify you if needed.

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,720
Let's examine the scene again

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
to see if the person in black

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,860
left any clues behind.

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,410
Don't make too much noise tonight.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,140
Have Master Six perform the autopsy.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,280
Also,

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,120
don't inform the Zhao household yet,

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
we'll notify them tomorrow,

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,480
to avoid alerting our suspects.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
Gentlemen,

47
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,480
if there's nothing else,

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,760
I'll take my leave now.

49
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,880
If you need anything, feel free to find me anytime

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,540
at Number 3, West Sixth Alley.

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm Lin Feng, and this is Li Qiang.

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,320
You may go now.

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,240
But remember,

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,130
this case involves imperial secrets,

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,420
you must not reveal a single word.

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,320
I understand,

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,780
Master Lin, rest assured.

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,240
Sir,

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
this Chu Bufan

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,460
doesn't seem like the killer.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,880
His attitude was quite forthright just now.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,410
We can't let our guard down.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,440
Let's test him first.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,850
The blacksmith Shi Jia is dead.

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Dead?

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,060
What happened?

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,000
This was

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,100
left behind by the killer.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,340
Women these days are getting more and more formidable.

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,240
Can you see any clues?

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,900
This is a crime of passion.

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,920
It doesn't look like a crime of passion.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
No, it's not.

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Not what?

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,940
Not a crime of passion.

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,920
Two officers from the Imperial Guard are here today,

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,360
suggesting this involves national security.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,019
A case for the Imperial Guard,

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
and you've fallen into it again.

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,079
Indeed,

81
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,600
what a coincidence, right?

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,530
I didn't finish making the weapon,

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,320
but I got a fine sword out of it.

84
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,120
Not bad, it's truly an excellent sword.

85
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
You're home, my dear.

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,100
Why do you seem so distracted?

87
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,380
Did something happen?

88
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,720
Be careful,

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,100
the tea is very hot.

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
What's really going on?

91
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
This is the first time in six years

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,610
I've seen you looking so troubled.

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
It's nothing.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,930
I was just thinking,

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
if one day I lose this job,

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,920
our life

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,980
might not be as comfortable anymore.

98
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,920
My love,

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
would you still be willing to face hardships with me?

100
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,040
I wouldn't.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,320
My dear,

102
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,720
what nonsense are you talking about?

103
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,159
No matter what your status becomes,

104
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,040
or what position you hold,

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
as long as our family stays together,

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,159
I'll be happy.

107
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,220
What's wrong with a little hardship?

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,080
Daddy's home!

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,140
Little troublemaker,

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
still awake?

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,000
Ping'an,

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,840
have you been good today?

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,440
Would you like Daddy to take you fishing tomorrow?

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,200
My dear,

115
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,560
why didn't you bring your official robes

116
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,620
home to wash today?

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,360
I left them at the office when I changed,

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,250
I'll bring them back tomorrow.

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,650
Don't forget tomorrow,

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
they always get so dirty.

121
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,970
How can I not wash it?

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Shi Jia?

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,080
Shi Jia?

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,360
Shi Jia has been killed.

125
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
The surprise gift mentioned in this letter,

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,480
I must investigate it myself.

127
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,840
Prepare the horses immediately.

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,880
Yes, Master.

129
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,060
Brother Li.

130
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,200
Master Chu,

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,360
please come back to the blacksmith shop with us.

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,240
Official Lin is waiting for us there.

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,560
Alright, let's go.

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Why do you look like

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,490
you knew we would come looking for you?

136
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,840
Both of you are responsible officials

137
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,040
who take your duties seriously

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,720
and have good judgment.

139
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Moreover, this case

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,760
cannot afford any delay,

141
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
so you certainly wouldn't let me slack off,

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,000
right?

143
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,900
Do you live here alone?

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
When I came back

145
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,520
I noticed two soldiers watching me from a distance.

146
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,280
They must be from the Imperial Guard,

147
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,810
verifying if the address I gave them was real.

148
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
You should be careful not to be discovered,

149
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
to avoid trouble.

150
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,600
They probably won't come back again.

151
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,240
Also,

152
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
at sunrise tomorrow,

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
go to the blacksmith's shop.

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,280
Yes.

155
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,580
Living here alone,

156
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
my friend

157
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
is busy with his business,

158
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,080
so he's not staying here.

159
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,240
Let's keep looking

160
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,520
for any new leads.

161
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,400
Brother Chu, on your journey north,

162
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
did you encounter anything unusual

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,580
worth sharing?

164
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Unusual?

165
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Are you interested in culinary discoveries

166
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,600
or strange celestial phenomena?

167
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Don't tease me, Brother Chu.

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,120
I know little about such things.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm just curious about how fascinating the outside world is,

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
wandering with your sword like you do.

171
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
It's truly enviable.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,280
The outside world has its joys and sorrows,

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,210
not necessarily what you imagine.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What do you mean?

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,360
I've seen more dead people this year

176
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,210
than in previous years.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,530
Is it because of the floods?

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,720
Not just floods.

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,370
This year's famine has grown more severe,

180
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,980
people are suffering,

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,280
and countless are dying of starvation.

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,520
When you face such situations,

183
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,890
you feel completely helpless.

184
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
I hope people can live well,

185
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
cherish their lives,

186
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
because you never know

187
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,880
whether tomorrow or disaster will come first.

188
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,280
This... this is...

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Looks like they were hiding something here after all.

190
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,810
These iron ore samples have a very high iron content.

191
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
And this ledger

192
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,100
must be recording secret transactions.

193
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,320
This Shi Jia is a blacksmith.

194
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,760
Smuggling iron ore is already a serious crime,

195
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,560
why does he also have sulfur ore?

196
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,040
These iron ore pieces must be samples.

197
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,900
High iron content and small size,

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,320
they must have been specially selected

199
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,240
to be easily transported

200
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,840
without drawing attention.

201
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
This sulfur ore

202
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,560
is a raw material for making gunpowder.

203
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,890
Poisonous insects.

204
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
High-grade iron ore.

205
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,200
Sulfur ore.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm afraid there's a bigger power behind

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,620
this iron ore smuggling case.

208
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,680
We need to quickly find out

209
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,210
who's pulling the strings.

210
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,640
This ledger contains

211
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,840
records of many transaction times and locations.

212
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
But strangely,

213
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,260
many of these locations have turned into ruins.

214
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
These times and locations

215
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
keep changing

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
without any pattern.

217
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,740
Clearly both parties in this transaction are being extremely cautious.

218
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,200
Who is Suo Yun?

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,240
Suo Yun?

220
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,400
That doesn't sound like a Central Plains name.

221
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,760
We need to find out

222
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
who this Suo Yun is as soon as possible,

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,080
she might be the key to solving all of this.

224
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,760
This

225
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,360
is a map of Tongzhou City.

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,840
See if it helps.

227
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,380
This is the charity house.

228
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
When we have time,

229
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
we can visit the children at the charity house.

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,620
I ran into someone in black this morning.

231
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
This thing seems

232
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,780
very important to her.

233
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,720
This is the information Shi Jia found,

234
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,050
it was very well hidden.

235
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
It contains detailed records

236
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
about Lin Feng.

237
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,500
It also mentions his wife.

238
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,080
Take a look.

239
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,880
Could this person in black be...

240
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
This Mrs. Lin is quite something.

241
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Go get that calligraphy piece

242
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
we brought with us.

243
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
I'm going to pay Lin Feng a visit.

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,720
If you're smart, don't resist

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,650
and come with us.

246
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
I need to find a chance

247
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,240
to explain everything to Lin Feng.

248
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,640
I can't delay any longer.

249
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,040
My love.

250
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
My dear, you're back.

251
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
We have a guest today.

252
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,440
This is Brother Chu, Chu Bufan.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Brother Chu has come from Yingtian Prefecture.

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
He even brought gifts

255
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,080
Come take a look.

256
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,880
Master Chu has come from afar

257
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
and brought such valuable gifts.

258
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,100
How thoughtful of you.

259
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
My husband loves these paintings so much.

260
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,760
He's never been able to collect ones he truly desires.

261
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,320
It seems he's quite pleased this time.

262
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
This painting

263
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
is beautiful.

264
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,760
My dear,

265
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,520
please prepare some food and wine.

266
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,720
Brother Chu, please don't mind

267
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,050
having a simple home-cooked meal with us.

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,040
Thank you, madam,

269
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,730
I appreciate your trouble.

270
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,680
You two enjoy yourselves first,

271
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,080
I'll go prepare the meal.

272
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,220
Thank you, my love.

273
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,540
Thank you for your trouble, sister-in-law.

274
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,440
You truly are

275
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
a considerate and supportive wife,

276
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,240
with remarkable grace.

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,970
Brother Lin,

278
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,740
you're truly blessed.

279
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,160
Brother Chu, you flatter me.

280
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,820
She's just an ordinary woman.

281
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,440
You didn't tell us you were coming,

282
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,960
so I haven't prepared many dishes.

283
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,690
These cured meats and vegetables are homegrown,

284
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,400
please try some, Master Chu.

285
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,480
Please don't be so formal, sister-in-law.

286
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,840
Home cooking is wonderful,

287
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,900
it has warmth to it.

288
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,440
Next time you visit, I'll prepare more.

289
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,600
Come, Brother Chu, have a taste.

290
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
Sister-in-law, your knife skills are impressive,

291
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,840
they look like...

292
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,839
You're too kind, Master Chu.

293
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,560
It's just ordinary housewife cutting skills.

294
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,619
Come, Brother Chu,

295
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,880
I toast to you.

296
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,970
Brother Lin, this wine is truly exceptional,

297
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,800
rich and lingering.

298
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,849
Today I truly intend to drink until I'm drunk.

299
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
Brother Chu has come from afar,

300
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,400
today we shall drink until we're drunk.

301
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,770
Brother Chu,

302
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,560
you've traveled the world for many years

303
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,020
and have vast experience.

304
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,960
Could you share

305
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,920
any interesting stories you've encountered?

306
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,180
Interesting stories?

307
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,890
Do you have any preferences, Brother Lin?

308
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
I've recently become quite interested

309
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
in certain medicinal herbs.

310
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Medicinal herbs?

311
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,240
What interesting stories could herbs possibly have?

312
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
Do tell.

313
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,890
For example, Paris polyphylla, also known as Chonglou,

314
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
though it's excellent for treating wounds and relieving pain,

315
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,440
in folk tales,

316
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,200
some say it can ward off evil spirits and disasters.

317
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
There was once an old doctor

318
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,800
who, whenever he went to the mountains to gather herbs,

319
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,640
would always bring along a few Chonglou plants.

320
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,960
It was said this would help him avoid fierce beasts and venomous insects.

321
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,040
Eventually, others followed his example,

322
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
bringing it along whenever they gathered herbs,

323
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,540
feeling much more at ease.

324
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,720
That is fascinating,

325
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,720
a medicine for healing wounds

326
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,050
becoming a treasure for warding off evil.

327
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,680
The ways of the world

328
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
are truly better experienced than heard about.

329
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,080
But speaking of venomous creatures...
