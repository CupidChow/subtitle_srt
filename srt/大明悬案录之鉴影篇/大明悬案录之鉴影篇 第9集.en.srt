1
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,360
You'd better think carefully

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
about what happened to your good friend Fengling.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,680
Do you want to end up like her?

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,180
Since you enjoy kneeling,

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,000
go kneel outside.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,040
Make sure you kneel on that cobblestone in the courtyard.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
Until the sun rises tomorrow,

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,360
you are not allowed to get up.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,960
Perhaps I'll change my mind.

10
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Fengling,

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,920
drink some medicine.

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,800
It will ease your pain.

13
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,720
They

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
aren't even human.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,920
Fengling,

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
I swear I'll kill them.

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Kill those beasts,

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,080
I'll kill them all.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,479
Lanxin,

20
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,880
my dear friend.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,680
You were to us

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
like warm sunshine in the cold winter.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,360
Warming our hearts.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
We were like family.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Promise me

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
you'll take good care of yourself.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,880
Don't act rashly.

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Don't forget our dream

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
to become the finest painters.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,120
To capture the world's wonders with our brushes

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,180
and create masterpieces.

32
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,480
I hope all our sisters

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,560
will find someone worthy to spend their lives with.

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:48,240
Someone who truly loves and cherishes them,

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
making life worthwhile.

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,720
They have human faces but beast hearts.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,720
Why do they torture us like this?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,660
And why did they do this to you?

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
What did we do wrong?

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,810
We followed all the instructions.

41
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,840
We abandoned our ideals and promises.

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,680
We trusted them so much.

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,400
Why did we come to this place?

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
Why? Why?

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm afraid I won't last much longer.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
I only hope

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,480
that the ugliness and darkness of this art studio

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,880
will one day be exposed to the world.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Those villains will be brought to justice.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
Fengling.

51
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,200
Fengling.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Fengling, wake up.

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Fengling.

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Fengling.

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,400
Fengling.

56
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,120
Fengling, wake up. Fengling.

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
People in the martial arts world say

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Chu Bufan has a chivalrous heart

59
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,560
and draws his sword to help those in need.

60
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
After the Golden Blade Clan case,

61
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,560
Master Chu's reputation

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,810
has spread throughout Tongzhou City.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,640
So you deliberately left a fake wooden pendant

64
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
to lure me in,

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,840
forcing me to get involved in this mess.

66
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,560
I had no other choice

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,330
but to take a gamble.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
If I failed,

69
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,050
I was already prepared to sacrifice everything.

70
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,220
When did you start planning this?

71
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,760
And when did you first make contact with the Ghost Market?

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,680
Since I was at the Yanbo Painting House.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
After seeing my sisters suffer such terrible abuse,

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,200
I was determined to escape from that hellhole.

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
I came from a good family.

76
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,600
My parents arranged

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,260
everything perfectly for me.

78
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,400
But then tragedy struck my family,

79
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,280
and I had to fend for myself.

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,960
I thought I could rely on my painting skills

81
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,440
to regain my former lifestyle.

82
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,760
But who knew

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,770
it would turn out to be such a massive scam.

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I must avenge Fengling.

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,700
They want to silence me permanently.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Three months ago,

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,250
I found Mu Di, the boss of Ghost Market.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,100
He said he could protect me

89
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,240
if I faked my death and hid in Ghost Market,

90
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,010
escaping those demons hunting me.

91
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,040
According to what you're saying,

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,080
you could have just escaped after faking your death,

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,280
so why seek me out?

94
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
I can protect myself,

95
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
but in the painting house

96
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,770
my dear friends Hanxiu and Yurou are still there.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,960
They're still trapped in that hellish place,

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,220
completely helpless.

99
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
I can't just stand by

100
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,330
watching them remain imprisoned.

101
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,360
I need to rescue them.

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,320
I need to think about this matter.

103
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Hearing only your side of the story

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
makes it difficult to be convinced.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,010
After I investigate in three days,

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,250
I'll come back here to find you.

107
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,160
Lanxin!

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,040
Lanxin, what's wrong?

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,760
Lanxin!

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,210
I've been poisoned.

111
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,159
Poisoned?

112
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,120
Chu Bufan!

113
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
How dare you

114
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,290
enter Ghost Market and try to take away my people!

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,960
Today I'll teach you the rules of Ghost Market.

116
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
My good sir,

117
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,970
there seems to be a misunderstanding.

118
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,240
I only went to Ghost Market looking for medicine,

119
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,120
with no intention to offend.

120
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
He is Mu Di,

121
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
the boss of Ghost Market.

122
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,850
Misunderstanding?

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
There are rules for coming and going in Ghost Market.

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
Whatever schemes or selfish intentions you have,

125
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
I might overlook them.

126
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,360
But if you're trying to take away my people,

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,020
a simple 'misunderstanding' won't resolve it.

128
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,040
Hero Chu,

129
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,320
you must escape now!

130
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,960
Lanxin!

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,560
You ungrateful fool!

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,610
Trying to leave?

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,050
Let's see if my blade allows it.

134
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,520
Bear with it

135
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
even if it hurts.

136
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,039
Madam Gu just sent word

137
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,880
that Master Lin will come tonight

138
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,559
to appreciate paintings with you

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,320
and wants you to get ready early.

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,200
I won't go.

141
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
I'd rather die than go.

142
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,720
If dying were that easy,

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,380
none of us would have to suffer like this.

144
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,760
Sister,

145
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm afraid the outcome will be a fate worse than death.

146
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,880
If you get a chance,

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
you must find a way to escape.

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,880
You can't end up like Sister Fengling.

149
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,800
Brother Chu, go quickly!

150
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
Leave this to me.

151
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,640
Lanxin.

152
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,880
Hero Chu,

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
perhaps you should stop helping me.

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,800
Cut the crap.

155
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,410
I've been on the run because of you,

156
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,060
how can I let you go without clearing my name?

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
Why are you poisoned?

158
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
It's a side effect of the fake death potion.

159
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,410
Actually, that potion isn't safe,

160
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
there's a chance it could be fatal.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,280
I thought I was lucky to escape,

162
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,880
but it seems I couldn't escape fate after all.

163
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Master Chu.

164
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
If you could help me

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,960
seek justice for my sisters at the painting house,

166
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,420
I can die without regrets.

167
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
You won't die while I'm here.

168
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,000
This poison

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,050
probably can't be cured by anyone.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,330
Hold on a little longer,

171
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,960
I know someone who can cure your poison.

172
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,530
Please step outside

173
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,930
I need to concentrate on the acupuncture.

174
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Hero Chu,

175
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,920
let's go outside

176
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,980
so we don't disturb the young master.

177
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,000
Hero Chu,

178
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
is this lady

179
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
someone special to you?

180
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,000
No, no.

181
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,040
Miss Ruoting, please don't misunderstand.

182
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
There's nothing between Lanxin and me.

183
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,720
I saved her because it was an emergency,

184
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
and it's quite complicated.

185
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,300
She's from the Yanbo Painting House,

186
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,160
and the situation there is too complex to explain.

187
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,560
Yanbo Painting House...

188
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,960
I've heard the painters there are extraordinary women,

189
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,400
each talented and beautiful,

190
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
admired by men everywhere.

191
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Each one of them has suffered terribly.

192
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,740
Their experiences are so tragic.

193
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,880
As a woman myself,

194
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,800
how could I remain indifferent and do nothing?

195
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,880
Master Chu,

196
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,260
is there anything I can do to help?

197
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,800
You'd better not get involved

198
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,330
in such dangerous matters.

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,400
How can I turn a blind eye

200
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,530
and deaf ear to this?

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,080
I know

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,660
life isn't as beautiful as in dreams.

203
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,800
But even in storybooks,

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
evil isn't this extreme.

205
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,960
I must lend you a hand,

206
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,160
speak up for justice,

207
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
fight against these evil forces,

208
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,900
and never compromise.

209
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,960
The situation is quite complicated now,

210
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,920
and even involves the county magistrate's office.

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,180
The powers behind this

212
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,300
are beyond what ordinary people like us can handle.

213
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,220
I need to plan this carefully.

214
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Miss Lanxin.

215
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,810
Brother Chu.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,000
I've finished the acupuncture treatment for Miss Lanxin,

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,860
and believe she'll recover soon.

218
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,540
Thank you for your help, Master Ling.

219
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,920
I have one more favor to ask.

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
I have an urgent matter to attend to now.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
I'll go with you.

222
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,200
You'd better not cause trouble,

223
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,660
don't hinder Brother Chu's investigation.

224
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,280
Master Ling is right.

225
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,280
Miss Lanxin needs to stay here,

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,520
please take care of her.

227
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Of course.

228
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,520
All right then,

229
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,120
go handle your important business without worry.

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,050
The young master and I will be here.

231
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,890
Thank you, Master Ling.

232
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,450
Thank you, Ruoting.

233
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,840
Can I move now?

234
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,840
To have the beautiful Hanxiu paint my portrait

235
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,720
is truly my good fortune.

236
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,450
Here's 1,000 taels of gold.

237
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,880
Are you tired, Miss Hanxiu?

238
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,320
I simply can't bear to see you so exhausted.

239
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Why don't we do

240
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,850
something more interesting instead?

241
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,960
If Master Lin is pleased with this painting,

242
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,640
that is honor enough for me.

243
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,480
As for anything else,

244
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,480
that won't be necessary.

245
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,520
No need to be shy, Miss Hanxiu.

246
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,280
I'll give you all the gold, silver, and jewels you desire.

247
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,320
Look, such a fine evening is rare.

248
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,520
How could we waste it?

249
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,000
Come,

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,160
let me appreciate

251
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,420
your beauty that rivals your paintings.

252
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,080
No!

253
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,560
Let me go!

254
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,280
Stop!

255
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,130
How dare you, Chu Bufan!

256
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,200
If you speak such nonsense,

257
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,260
don't blame me for punishing you.

258
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,540
Your Honor,

259
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,930
I am truly innocent.

260
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,120
Miss Lanxin from Yanbo Painting Studio

261
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,640
is not actually dead.

262
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,720
There is

263
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,520
something hidden behind all this.

264
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,000
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Honor.

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Lan Xin

266
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,330
faked her death?

267
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,320
If that's true,

268
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,760
what evidence do you have?

269
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,400
Sir,

270
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,000
there's a hidden mechanism under the painting platform at Yanbo Gallery.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,360
That mechanism can easily switch

272
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,090
a scarecrow with a real person.

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Sir, if you send someone

274
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,600
to go with me to the gallery,

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,520
I can prove it on the spot.

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
I want to see what solid evidence you have.

277
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,040
If what you say is true,

278
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,960
I will clear your name.

279
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,680
If you're lying,

280
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,120
you'll face severe punishment.

281
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Constable Li,

282
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,650
come with me to Yanbo Gallery immediately

283
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
to uncover the truth.

284
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,490
What a delightful atmosphere!

285
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
This Yanbo Painting Studio truly lives up to its reputation.

286
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,160
May I trouble you for a moment?

287
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,200
I need to investigate a murder case here.

288
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,280
Sir.

289
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,890
The key to Lanxin's fake death mystery

290
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,170
lies beneath that painting table.

291
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Sir,

292
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,280
Lanxin faked her death right here,

293
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,280
then hid under this secret compartment,

294
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,540
and escaped when the opportunity arose.

295
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,760
Open it.

296
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,319
Oh my God! Master Lin

297
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,000
how did he die,

298
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,319
and right here of all places?
