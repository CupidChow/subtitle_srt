1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,200
Mom, you look so beautiful today.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
I'm honored to have all of you visit our humble home today

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,810
to celebrate my father's birthday

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,760
I'm truly grateful.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,720
Let's all drink together

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
and enjoy these delicacies.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Miss Situ's kindness and generosity

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
is truly a blessing for all of us in Tongzhou.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
I often hear how you distribute grain and medicine

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,720
helping the poor without asking for anything in return

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,400
such benevolence is truly a model for all of us.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Well said indeed.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,200
The Situ family, as Tongzhou's

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,440
foremost merchant of food supplies

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
has for many years provided

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,400
the finest grains and medicinal herbs to the people.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,800
The young mistress distributes food freely

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,860
she truly is a person of great virtue.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,960
All of you have come from afar

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,280
giving me face

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,880
to celebrate my birthday

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,480
I am deeply grateful.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,000
Today is not only my 60th birthday

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,720
but also the day my daughter Chenyun and my son-in-law An Ruolai

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,960
officially take over the family business.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Chenyun has been exceptionally intelligent since childhood

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,780
and kind-hearted.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,520
These years, managing family affairs with Ruolai

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,400
have given me great comfort.

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,360
Now that my wife and I are getting old

31
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,650
we wish to live a peaceful life.

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,400
I believe this couple

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,680
will certainly make our Situ family

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,600
prosper

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
and bring more benefits to the people of Tongzhou.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,240
Come, thank you all

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
let's have another drink.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,680
Cheers.

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,560
Come, cheers.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,810
Please, everyone sit down.

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,600
Yun'er

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
what's wrong?

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,250
I want to go back and rest for a while

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,490
don't worry about me

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,120
take good care of the guests.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,320
Tian'er

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,220
will you come back to the room with me?

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
Yun'er, Mother.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,480
Yun'er,

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,040
Mother, please wake up.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,640
What's wrong, Yun'er?

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,400
Yun'er.

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,520
Yun'er,

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,560
child,

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,079
what's wrong?

56
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,320
Mother, please wake up.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,000
Father,

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
please save Mother quickly.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,320
Yun'er,

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,079
Yun'er, wake up, please.

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,920
Someone come,

62
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,360
get a doctor, hurry!

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,480
Yun'er, Yun'er, wake up.

64
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Yun'er.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,240
How is my Yun'er?

66
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,920
Master Situ,

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,079
Madam,

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I've done my best.

69
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,329
Please accept my condolences.

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,240
Mother! Yun'er!

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Yun'er, my daughter,

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
how could you leave us so suddenly?

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,360
How am I supposed to go on without you?

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,079
My Yun'er has always been in good health,

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,079
how could she suddenly pass away for no reason?

76
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,440
How could you be so cruel?

77
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
This is too suspicious.

78
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,560
Guards!

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,170
Go report this to the authorities at once!

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,980
Chu Bufan and Zhao Ruting.

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
Why have you come to the Situ residence?

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,240
Officer Li,

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
Situ Chenyun who passed away

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,080
was a close friend of mine,

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
who always took good care of me.

86
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,760
When I heard the terrible news this morning,

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,560
I was shocked

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,020
and came immediately to pay my respects.

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Sister Yun.

90
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
The young lady of the Situ family looks peaceful.

91
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,560
No external injuries, no toxic spots on the skin

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
no damage to internal organs

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,060
and no signs of poisoning.

94
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,520
It clearly happened during a family dinner

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,320
when she suddenly vomited blood and collapsed,

96
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,600
which looks exactly like poisoning.

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,400
My daughter was always in good health,

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,520
how could she die suddenly without reason?

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,560
Yun'er was kind all her life.

100
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,320
How could she meet such a tragic fate?

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,780
Someone must have deliberately harmed her.

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,600
Yun'er,

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,970
if you've suffered any injustice,

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,100
please tell your mother everything.

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Official Li.

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
I refuse to believe

107
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
that Yun'er suddenly died of illness without cause.

108
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
Please investigate thoroughly,

109
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,000
and uncover the truth.

110
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,130
Master Situ,

111
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
Miss Chen Yun

112
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,560
shows no symptoms of poisoning.

113
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm afraid further examinations won't change anything.

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Master An.

115
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,890
Please accept my condolences.

116
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,570
Your family still needs your care.

117
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,650
Tian is still young.

118
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
If you need anything,

119
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,960
just have your servants notify me.

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,960
Oh, my Yun!

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,320
Thank you.

122
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,440
Sister Yun invited me

123
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,610
to Master Situ's birthday banquet a few days ago,

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,330
but I couldn't attend due to family troubles.

125
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I never imagined we'd be separated forever like this.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
Fortune and misfortune can change in an instant,

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,680
just as the moon waxes and wanes,

128
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,300
such is the way of life.

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't be too sad.

130
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,520
Tian.

131
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,920
Mother was murdered.

132
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
She coughed up so much blood,

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
she died horribly.

134
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,600
Be good, Tian,

135
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
don't cry.

136
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Auntie is here,

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll always stay by your side,

138
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,250
I won't go anywhere.

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,940
Don't cry anymore.

140
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Chu Bufan,

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,570
what are you doing here?

142
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,100
Weren't you about to come looking for me?

143
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,880
I already figured out what you were thinking.

144
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
But I'm curious,

145
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,840
the Situ family is a well-known food supplier in Tongzhou,

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,570
with vast wealth and business,

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,900
and Miss Chen Yun is their only daughter,

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,280
the sole heir.

149
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,240
She has a good reputation,

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,880
and has never made enemies with anyone.

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
Who would want to harm her?

152
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,720
I don't know if I should say this,

153
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,880
but if Sister Yun dies,

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,640
then all the Situ family assets

155
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
would certainly be controlled by her husband An Ruolai

156
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,240
completely.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,170
You suspect there's something wrong with An Ruolai?

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,460
It's just my speculation.

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
But in those story books,

160
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
plots about husbands harming their wives

161
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,440
are certainly not uncommon.

162
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,560
I remember Sister Yun mentioned before

163
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,280
that she occasionally felt pain in her chest,

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,210
I'm afraid she was already being poisoned back then.

165
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,340
You've been reading too many novels.

166
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,180
If you suspect there's more to her death,

167
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
I'll help you uncover the truth.

168
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Don't overthink things,

169
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
take care of yourself,

170
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,320
and just wait for my news.

171
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,880
Remember

172
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
not to act on your own,

173
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,760
avoid alerting anyone and bringing trouble upon yourself.

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,890
Don't worry, I won't do anything rash.

175
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
Be careful.

176
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,120
You go first.

177
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,580
What were you about to say?

178
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,400
Nothing.

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,770
Take good care of yourself.

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,940
I'll stay with you.

181
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Chicken and Pigeon

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Chicken and Pigeon

183
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Sea cucumber.

184
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,640
Heshui River

185
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,500
Dried scallop.

186
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,960
Fish maw.

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,010
Deer tendon.

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,840
Why is there a menu in this study?

189
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,600
And it's so detailed.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,400
The Situ family is the largest food supplier in Tongzhou.

191
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Why would they buy from somewhere else?

192
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
Sir,

193
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,080
what would you like to order?

194
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,210
I've heard your sea cucumbers are of excellent quality.

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,850
Our sea cucumbers at Luopin Pavilion,

196
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
they're all fresh from the coast,

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,880
the quality is impeccable.

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,720
The ones used at the Situ family's birthday banquet a few days ago

199
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,450
were purchased from your shop,

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
do you remember?

201
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes,

202
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
the Situ family banquet

203
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,820
they selected only the finest goods,

204
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
we certainly wouldn't dare to be negligent.

205
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,280
I've heard your sea cucumbers are from the East Sea,

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,520
may I ask where exactly they're harvested?

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
Sir,

208
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
the origin of sea cucumbers isn't fixed,

209
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,400
sometimes they're from the East Sea,

210
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
sometimes from the South Sea,

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
as for the specifics,

212
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,760
we're not entirely sure.

213
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Your shop must keep

214
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,320
detailed records of your product sources,

215
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,450
if I could know this,

216
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,650
I'd feel more comfortable making a purchase.

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Sir,

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
we only handle sales,

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,060
as for the sources,

220
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
it's not convenient to disclose them,

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
please understand.

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,240
Then I'll just buy a small amount today,

223
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,970
to try first.

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,600
Good.

225
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,680
Try it first,

226
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,250
come back if you like it.

227
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,120
Boss,

228
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,680
in this Yangchun Lane,

229
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,140
which shop has the best quality deer tendon?

230
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,040
Sir, you want deer tendon?

231
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,960
Well, in Yangchun Lane,

232
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,920
there are only one or two shops selling deer tendon,

233
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,240
but if you want the best,

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,400
it would be from Tongjiang Seafood.

235
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,570
Tongjiang Seafood?

236
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,090
A seafood shop also sells deer tendon?

237
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Sir, you may not know,

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,760
this Tongjiang Seafood

239
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,120
is the most well-stocked shop

240
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,520
in our lane,

241
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
they don't just sell seafood,

242
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
they have deer tendons, animal tendons,

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,360
rare medicinal ingredients, they have it all,

244
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,960
basically whatever you need,

245
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
they have it in stock.

246
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,920
And also.

247
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,040
All the wealthy families in our Tongzhou city

248
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,080
get their ingredients

249
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,740
exclusively from that place.

250
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
However, their goods

251
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,530
are somewhat more expensive than others.

252
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,480
Young master, you'd better watch your purse.

253
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,080
If the goods are of high quality,

254
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
I don't mind paying more.

255
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,650
Thank you, boss.

256
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,080
Take care, young master.

257
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,160
Please come again.

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,840
You have a good eye, sir.

259
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,880
These deer tendons are excellent tonics,

260
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,640
good for strengthening muscles and bones.

261
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,250
All the great households use them,

262
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,400
they're essential for banquets.

263
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Is that so?

264
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,120
But these deer tendons look

265
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,780
somewhat different from what I usually see,

266
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,240
the color is dull,

267
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
and the smell is different too.

268
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Have you noticed that?

269
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
You really are an expert, sir.

270
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,000
But you're overthinking it.

271
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,600
These deer tendons come from different regions,

272
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,720
so the color and taste vary slightly,

273
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,720
but the quality is absolutely guaranteed.

274
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,560
Is this deer tendon supplied by the Situ family?

275
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Young master, you can rest assured,

276
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,960
everything is guaranteed,

277
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,480
all premium ingredients.

278
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,040
It's just a different flavor,

279
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,480
the taste is fine,

280
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,160
absolutely no problem.

281
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,460
I'll take some.

282
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,160
What's the special occasion today

283
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,890
to prepare so many delicacies?

284
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
I have no idea.

285
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,680
Chu Bufan,

286
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,160
I never thought a rough man like you

287
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,480
would have such culinary skills.

288
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,360
Of course,

289
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
our Brother Chu

290
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,090
specially trained at a grand restaurant before.

291
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,480
This is dried scallops with braised sea cucumber,

292
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,280
made with premium sea cucumber caught in the East Sea,

293
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,140
combined with Tongzhou's special dried scallops,

294
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,000
simmered for several hours,

295
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,560
with rich broth that melts in your mouth,

296
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,240
you must savor it well.

297
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,360
It's indeed incredibly delicious.

298
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,520
This is steamed conch with egg white,

299
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,960
using Tongzhou's famous wild sea conch,

300
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,480
paired with delicate egg white,

301
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,640
fragrant and rich with a lingering taste.

302
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,520
These conch slices are so tender,

303
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,440
full of umami,

304
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
wealthy families really know how to enjoy life.

305
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,600
This is fish maw stuffed with minced seafood,

306
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,840
the fish maw goes through multiple processes.

307
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,960
Then brewed with floral essence,

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,360
creating a silky texture with a unique fragrance.

309
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,200
This premium fish maw from Dongjiang fishmongers,

310
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,760
just the fish maw alone,

311
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
is already a precious delicacy.

312
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,240
This fish maw has a distinctive aroma,

313
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,160
and a delicate, smooth texture.

314
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,200
This dish is pigeon stewed with goji berries,

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,160
using Ningxia goji berries and Tongzhou mountain pigeons.

316
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,760
The broth is clear and nourishing for the skin,

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,880
with the subtle sweetness of goji berries blending with the savory pigeon meat.

318
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
A truly restorative dish.

319
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
And finally, this dish is...

320
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,920
I know this one!

321
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
This is braised deer tendon.

322
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,240
Made with special deer tendon from Liaodong hunting grounds,

323
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,040
after Brother Chu's slow-cooking method,

324
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,970
giving it a tender texture with perfect elasticity.

325
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,240
And with these secret seasonings added,

326
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,480
the flavor is rich and full-bodied,

327
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,810
with complex and diverse taste profiles.

328
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
But why did you

329
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,599
suddenly prepare so many delicacies

330
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,400
for us today?

331
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm afraid this might be a trap,

332
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,680
Chu Bufan.

333
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,329
You're not going to ask me to save someone again, are you?

334
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,680
The recipes for today's dishes

335
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,200
actually have quite a story behind them.

336
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,079
What story?

337
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
What do you mean?

338
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,400
Before Si Tu Chenyun died,

339
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,360
these were exactly the dishes she ate.
