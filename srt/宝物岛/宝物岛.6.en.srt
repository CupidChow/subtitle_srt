{\an8}SEO DONGJU

25
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:29,774
{\an8}Mr. Huh.

26
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:30,858
{\an8}Ihyeon.

27
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,736
{\an8}What brings you here?

28
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,155
{\an8}Right, you're here for patient Seo Dongju.

29
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,408
{\an8}The chairman is deeply
concerned about this.

30
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,462
You're here.

31
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,298
I got a call from the chairman.

32
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,134
Did Dongju go for his tests?

33
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,012
Dr. Kang!

34
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,349
Hey, Dr. Kang. Did you find Director Seo?

35
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,192
Is there a way to find Dongju
without involving the police?

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,654
It'll be faster
if we get help from Eunnam's in-laws

37
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,156
than the police, Sister.

38
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Director,

39
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,083
even if we skip the police,
we must tell the chairman.

40
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,293
No, Dr. Kang.

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,551
He isn't in the best condition these days.

42
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,345
He can't take a shock right now.

43
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,811
<i>Is money worth more than your life,</i>

44
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,855
<i>Seo Dongju?</i>

45
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,734
Bring me your boss.

46
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,655
The one who said I know the password.

47
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,284
I'll make it crystal clear
to that bastard.

48
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,996
That I honestly have no idea.

49
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,044
<i>Is money worth more than your life,</i>

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,796
<i>Seo Dongju?</i>

51
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,798
I said I don't know, damn...

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,884
Bastard!

53
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,070
- Mmm.
- Is it good?

54
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,656
ADMINISTRATOR

55
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,325
Mmm.

56
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,911
I've been waiting a long time
for good news.

57
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,122
That should've been done in half a day,
but it took longer.

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,917
Then again, it's no ordinary item.

59
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,338
Yes, hold on.

60
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,806
If he's not someone we can throw out,

61
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,557
you must take him back, sir.

62
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,977
So, you're saying
he's not faking it?

63
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,815
Is that your expert opinion?

64
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,195
Of course, he has to stay alive.
It's not that I want him to live.

65
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,949
It's just that I really need
what's in his mind.

66
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,575
Honestly, even if I could,

67
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,869
tearing him apart
and scattering the pieces

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,247
still wouldn't be enough.

69
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,875
That's how much I despise that bastard.

70
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,086
Yes.

71
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,063
I told Dongju

72
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,941
that I'd curse you out for him.

73
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,277
But he said he'd do it himself

74
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,571
and asked me to pray

75
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,073
for your health and happiness.

76
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,915
Please,

77
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,585
help me find Dongju.

78
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,255
Yes, Sister Agnes.

79
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,844
The name "Seong Hyeon"

80
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,971
was Dongju's name

81
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,765
when he was very little.

82
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,268
As he got older, he forgot all about it.

83
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,605
He never recalled it after that.

84
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,674
Director Seo!

85
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,262
Goodness.

86
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,557
Who are you?

87
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,768
What?

88
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,275
<i>Seo Dongju,</i>

89
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,195
<i>is money worth more than your life?</i>

90
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,656
The password is...

91
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,620
The password is...

92
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,207
One...

93
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,377
Two...

94
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,295
Three...

95
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,380
Four...

96
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,507
Five...

97
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,424
Sixty and seventy thousand,

98
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,968
you bastards.

99
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,771
Hey!

100
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,703
Goddammit.

101
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,528
President Huh.

102
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,093
Not the hospital.

103
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,763
Take me to the chairman's residence.

104
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,975
I need to speak with him.

105
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:47,916
Director Seo!

106
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,806
Hmm.

107
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,019
President Huh saved me.

108
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,613
Where's Secretary Gong's porridge?

109
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,659
Chef Do must've forgotten
since he's so busy.

110
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,911
The chairman

111
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,498
urgently ordered herbal chicken porridge
for Director Seo's recovery.

112
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,250
He has to defrost the chicken in a rush.

113
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,127
It's so much work for Chef Do.

114
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,213
But do native chickens

115
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,674
help with memory loss?

116
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,841
Chef Do!

117
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,260
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,054
Hold off on Director Seo's porridge.
Start with Secretary Gong's.

119
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,432
Director Seo
is in the chairman's study right now.

120
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,561
Secretary Gong always says
old folks shouldn't overdo it

121
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,023
since getting sick
just makes them a burden.

122
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,483
You saw what happened.

123
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,776
She smashed the cake

124
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,364
then ran off claiming she was sick
when asked to set the table again.

125
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,159
She's always so sneaky
about putting herself first...

126
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,787
She walked off while I was talking?

127
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,457
Sometimes,

128
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,669
Ms. Cha treats people
like they're nothing.

129
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,295
Honey.

130
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,089
That's not something you're taught.

131
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,134
It's something you pick up as you grow.

132
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,845
Maybe she never learned
since the chairman's wife passed early.

133
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,096
- Remember last time?
- Stop.

134
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,308
- Secretary Gong and Ms. Cha...
- No...

135
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,565
I apologize, Secretary Gong.

136
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,318
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,449
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

138
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,204
Hurry with the porridge.

139
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,914
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,960
Gosh.

141
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,462
See?

142
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,964
I told you it was odd.

143
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,800
Every time Ms. Cha's name comes up,

144
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,679
Secretary Gong gets angrier than usual.

145
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,265
Please!

146
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,100
My goodness.

147
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,022
If those bastards want
the Swiss account password,

148
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,522
then Cheon Guho...

149
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,610
No, they should've kidnapped me instead.

150
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,571
They were so relentless.

151
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,741
At one point, I started to wonder

152
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,454
if I did know the password
but lost my memory of it.

153
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,457
No way.

154
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,003
I would've never entrusted something
that important to Director Seo, right?

155
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,047
Exactly.

156
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,509
Thank you for saving Director Seo,
Mr. Yeom.

157
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,594
President Huh did all the work.

158
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:53,100
I only provided a few details
about Director Seo's abduction, Chairman.

159
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,768
Without you,

160
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,480
Director Seo
might not have made it out alive.

161
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,148
Always a man of reason, Chairman.

162
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,944
I'll gladly accept your gratitude.

163
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,487
We should report this to the prosecution

164
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,533
and let law enforcement handle it.

165
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,327
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Yeom.

166
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:15,623
I'll frame it as an abduction
by those after Daesan's business secrets.

167
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,752
I'll have my contacts in the prosecution
take care of it.

168
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,379
You should step back.

169
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,547
We will handle this.

170
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,632
Father.

171
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,635
I don't think
the prosecution can resolve this matter.

172
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,720
No, this is something they...

173
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,308
The things that happened to Director Seo
aren't just simple matters.

174
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,063
When I rescued him earlier,
I saw a gunshot wound on his stomach.

175
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,982
What?

176
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,276
A gunshot wound?

177
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,653
Someone must've shot him...

178
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,700
trying to kill him.

179
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,380
Did you really get shot?

180
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,062
Gosh, these are...

181
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,941
These really are gunshot wounds.

182
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,779
He got shot like this and still survived.

183
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,324
The gods must be on his side.

184
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,451
Who on earth...

185
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:38,497
I think the shock of being shot
caused my memory loss.

186
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,836
Call the prosecution.

187
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,507
Chairman, I don't want an investigation.

188
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,177
The one who shot me...

189
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,348
The one after the slush fund
could be someone within law enforcement.

190
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,359
Right now, I'm suspicious of everything.

191
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,447
Mmm. He's not wrong, Chairman.

192
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,533
Please wait until I regain my memory

193
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,123
or at least until I remember anything
about the one who's trying to kill me.

194
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,919
To both of you...

195
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,382
I won't forget that
you both saved me today.

196
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,220
Director Seo is the one
who needs to regain his memory,

197
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,681
so we should do as he wants.

198
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,391
Anyway,

199
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,810
I heard you lost your memory
as a child too.

200
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,145
How did you recover it then?

201
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,522
What...

202
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,358
You don't remember?

203
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,485
I don't.

204
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,822
Who told you
that I once lost my memory as a child?

205
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,324
Your sister told us.

206
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,621
So...

207
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,040
I have a sister.

208
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,501
You should meet her,

209
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,212
see your doctor again,

210
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,796
and go back to work.

211
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,549
Try everything you can.

212
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,602
It's burdock tea, Chairman.

213
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,687
Okay.

214
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,069
I leave it to you, Seong Hyeon.

215
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,449
Yes, I'll take care of it.

216
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
Secretary Gong.

217
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,457
Please call me Seo Dongju from now on.

218
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,210
It feels unfamiliar,

219
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,921
but I think I need that name now

220
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,633
more than "Seong Hyeon."

221
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,261
Director Seo will be staying here for now.

222
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,347
Father, it's better for him

223
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,224
to stay in the hospital or his home
where he feels comfortable.

224
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,353
No, we can't leave him alone.

225
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,355
No arguments.

226
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,981
If he needs a doctor, bring one here.

227
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,026
Outpatient treatment's fine. Got it?

228
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,403
I understand.

229
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,164
Quite the performance today.

230
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,335
"Someone must've shot Director Seo,
trying to kill him."

231
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,257
The shooter sitting right in front
of the one he shot.

232
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,473
In any case, you stopped Chairman Cha
from involving the prosecution.

233
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,058
Good job.

234
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,977
But...

235
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,022
provoking Director Seo like that

236
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,442
might have suddenly
brought his memory back.

237
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,362
Why did you take that risk?

238
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,365
If he remembers
the Swiss account password,

239
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,827
my name will come up right alongside it.

240
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,915
Isn't that right, sir?

241
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,552
What's with you today?

242
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,803
You may be quiet,

243
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,682
but you've never been one
to beat around the bush.

244
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,146
This thought suddenly crossed my mind.

245
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:38,320
"I should probably
try to kill Seo Dongju again

246
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,699
and bury the fact
that I shot him forever."

247
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,662
Seo Dongju's head
is worth two trillion won.

248
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,083
Anyone who dares interfere,
I won't let it slide.

249
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,508
Give me...

250
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,219
half of it, sir.

251
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,055
Half of it?

252
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,561
You mean half of Seo Dongju's body?

253
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,646
One trillion won.

254
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,274
Half of what's in the Swiss account.

255
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,904
You haven't told Chairman Cha

256
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,700
that the Swiss account
is in Seo Dongju's hands.

257
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,371
And I know exactly why.

258
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,082
You're keeping quiet because you're afraid

259
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,420
he will get his hands on
the two trillion won in Seo Dongju's head

260
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,256
now that it's up for grabs, aren't you?

261
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:47,598
You might lose it all.
Better to sacrifice half than lose it all.

262
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:59,068
You crazy bastard.
You're completely out of your damn mind.

263
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,488
I'll give you 10%.

264
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,202
But we need to retrieve the account first.

265
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,455
Then we can discuss
whether it's 10% or half. Right?

266
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,749
Is there a need

267
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,586
for such a meaningless discussion
between us?

268
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,215
Kill Seo Dongju 10 times,
20 times, 100 times if you want.

269
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,929
Whether you bury him and bring him back
just to kill him again, it's up to you.

270
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,305
But first,

271
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,601
secure the Swiss account password.

272
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:44,196
I must kill Seo Dongju again
as soon as possible, sir.

273
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,533
Please understand

274
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,869
how much restraint

275
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,539
I am showing.

276
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,348
Yes?

277
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,820
The chairman made quite the fuss,

278
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,698
rushing me into making
this native chicken porridge

279
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,785
to help you get your strength back.

280
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,998
You really don't remember me?

281
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,624
I do.

282
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,709
Right?

283
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,462
So you do remember me!

284
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:27,132
You ran out
when the banquet table got overturned...

285
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,677
Gosh.

286
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,765
You recruited me from that soup joint
where I was getting chewed out.

287
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,059
Do you seriously not remember?

288
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,734
Eat up and feel better.

289
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,838
Oh, my bag.

290
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:07,965
Thank you.

291
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,386
Have a seat.

292
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,054
Okay.

293
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,275
You had this when you first came here.

294
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,943
Most people hate the taste,

295
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,030
but you followed the chairman's lead
and drank it anyway.

296
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,158
It made him happy.

297
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,495
After that, you actually grew to like it.

298
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,289
You enjoyed drinking it.

299
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,875
I see.

300
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,503
It might help bring back your memory.

301
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,922
Try drinking it
before having the porridge.

302
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,973
Are you sure I liked drinking it?

303
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,060
Thank you.

304
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,237
Thank you.

305
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,449
For putting in the effort
to restore my memory.

306
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,993
I hope you regain it soon.

307
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,456
- By the way...
- That time...

308
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,919
Did you drop the cake

309
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:32,049
because the name Seong Hyeon startled you?

310
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,474
I was just exhausted
from preparing the banquet.

311
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,061
I got a little lightheaded and slipped.

312
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,438
If I was truly shocked by the name,

313
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,567
I wouldn't have called you Seong Hyeon

314
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,737
in the chairman's study earlier.

315
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,825
I figured you called me Seong Hyeon
on purpose.

316
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,912
To pretend you were
never surprised by my name.

317
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,126
I had never heard that name before.

318
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,379
So why would I be startled by it?

319
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,553
Because of your memory loss,

320
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,807
you're sensitive
to everything around you right now.

321
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,392
I understand that.

322
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,309
But...

323
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,271
I really was just lightheaded.

324
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,238
There was a car accident.

325
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,993
When I thought I was going to die,

326
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,079
someone called out, "Seong Hyeon."

327
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,164
But it was a dream.

328
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,167
But even in my dream,

329
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,255
I instinctively knew they were calling me.

330
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,799
Seong Hyeon...

331
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,927
That must have been my name as a child.

332
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,852
I was told
I lost my memory as a child too.

333
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,272
I guess I have a habit
of losing my memories.

334
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,818
I clearly saw you react
when you heard my name.

335
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,697
You must have a reason for denying it.

336
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,288
Firstly,

337
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,459
I'll start by remembering
that I liked raw eggs

338
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,128
and work my way from there.

339
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,468
If you need more porridge...

340
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,511
Over there.

341
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,097
Just use that intercom.

342
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,850
Okay.

343
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,056
Cha Deokhui.

344
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,853
Deokhui.

345
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
President Huh.

346
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,743
You used to let me use this bar, right?

347
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,829
When I first got here
after my memory loss,

348
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,373
I looked up here from down there,

349
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,126
and it felt strangely familiar.

350
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,131
I just remembered why.

351
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,133
I used to work out over here.

352
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,385
That never happened.

353
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,598
I was up here,

354
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,476
and you were down there.

355
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,147
You looked up at me from down there.

356
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,864
The man doing pull-ups in your memory...

357
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,951
isn't you.

358
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,037
It's me.

359
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,417
You got it mixed up.

360
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,099
Are you sure
we never had a pull-up contest before?

361
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,184
Get out.

362
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,770
- Pardon?
- Didn't you hear me?

363
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,775
I heard you.

364
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,780
Can I discuss something with you
before I go?

365
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,494
All right.

366
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,289
I was hoping to talk to you

367
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,877
since I can't tell anyone else about it.

368
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,135
What is it that you can tell only me?

369
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,597
Well...

370
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,691
Tell me next time. Please leave.

371
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,448
President Huh.

372
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,497
Did you try to shoot me dead?

373
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,219
I just want the truth.

374
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,391
Come on, Director Seo.

375
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,100
What's with you?

376
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,146
The few fragments of my past memories

377
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,525
keep telling me
that the one who shot me is you.

378
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,279
On top of that, I had a dream last night.

379
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:52,988
What kind of dream?

380
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,200
I went into the water to save you...

381
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:24,980
<i>Seo Dongju.</i>

382
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,149
Seo Dongju!

383
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,291
Bang!

384
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,509
That's one hell of a dream.

385
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,137
I know, right?

386
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,983
We hated each other.

387
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,569
I resented and envied you a lot.

388
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,946
Sometimes maybe too much.

389
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,324
And you knew about it too.

390
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,871
With how I treated you,

391
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,249
there was no way you could have liked me.

392
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,293
But you saved me when I was kidnapped.

393
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,047
You saved me from drowning.

394
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,258
Your memory of pull-ups...

395
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,760
Yes, I got it mixed up.

396
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,179
Just like that mistake,

397
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,391
maybe your desperate need

398
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,895
to remember who shot you

399
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,148
made you place me in that role.

400
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,239
But what I still can't understand...

401
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,201
is how vivid...

402
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,704
these memories are.

403
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,375
Like you said,

404
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,587
could it be because I resented you?

405
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,347
I'll get going.

406
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,765
Honey.

407
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,730
Are you done working out already?
Why are you here?

408
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,693
Well... I was going to
take my herbal tonic.

409
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,403
So you could sleep in.

410
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,740
Even that short walk is a waste of time?

411
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,532
What?

412
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,368
The dumbbell behind your back.

413
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,123
Yeah. You're right.

414
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,831
Yes.

415
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,876
<i>I realized
I don't have your number.</i>

416
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,668
Yes.

417
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:20,089
I thought of a good way
to fix your false memory.

418
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,979
Dad.

419
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,525
I thought you had already left.

420
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,113
I didn't even drink water
so I wouldn't wake you,

421
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,573
but you're up already?

422
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,034
Sleep in for once.

423
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,038
You should be the one sleeping in
when you're home for a change.

424
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,167
Why torture the soil so early?
Even the soil needs a break.

425
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,878
- Right?
- All right.

426
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,218
We have a visitor.

427
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,470
A visitor? Who?

428
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,931
What?

429
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,141
It's Ildo.

430
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,477
Ildo!

431
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,688
You're here too.

432
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,983
What, you're not here for me?

433
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,484
I'm here for Ihyeon.

434
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,278
I urgently need a favor.

435
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,481
They're making you wait out here too long.

436
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,442
It's freshly picked cucumber.

437
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,068
The first bite's bitter,

438
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,405
but keep chewing, and it'll turn
salty and sweet, with a hint of ginseng.

439
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,949
Try it.

440
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,833
A hint of ginseng.

441
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,544
How's the yard? Looks nice, right?

442
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,214
Landscaping is my job, after all.

443
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,800
Since I travel a lot for work,

444
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,679
the yard gets needy whenever I'm home,

445
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,390
always begging for a touch-up.

446
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:41,063
By the way, we've met before, haven't we?
Where was it?

447
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,941
Do you remember me?

448
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,152
I swear we've met.

449
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,779
That's right!

450
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,572
Wait, no...

451
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,243
Maybe I designed the garden
at your father's house?

452
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,578
You're young, you should remember.

453
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,581
My head is pretty fuzzy now.

454
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,377
Your face is way too familiar...

455
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,087
Don't push him.

456
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,507
He doesn't remember his past.

457
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,554
Dr. Kang has agreed to help you.

458
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:27,694
If Director Seo was always in Daesan,
he and I wouldn't have crossed paths.

459
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,822
How did he end up with memory loss?

460
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,201
That's rough.

461
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,496
Hope Ihyeon can be of some help.

462
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:44,293
Gosh. No matter how much I sleep,
I still feel tired.

463
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,296
Drifting around the country
like a peddler.

464
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,385
Wouldn't have been so tough
if you took the professor job

465
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,595
at Daesan University's
landscaping department.

466
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,890
Hey, I used to curse you every day

467
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,976
for seducing your dead friend's wife,

468
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,311
marrying her,

469
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,480
and climbing your way into a rich family.

470
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,444
How could I ever join Daesan University
after trash-talking you so much?

471
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,822
When Ihyeon got into
Daesan Hospital's residency program,

472
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,949
you know what I told her?

473
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,576
That since my friend, Huh Ildo,

474
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,370
is the son-in-law of Daesan's chairman,

475
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,247
people will assume
she got in through connections.

476
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,876
That she should look elsewhere.

477
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,211
Ihyeon stared at me for a long moment

478
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,382
and told me
she didn't care what people thought

479
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,718
and that it made her sad

480
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,180
that I was only so cynical about you.

481
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,474
Because I'm not a cynical person.

482
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,477
Gosh.

483
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,979
Over time,

484
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:49,442
I realized I badmouthed you
out of jealousy back then.

485
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,277
Then I thought

486
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,113
Yeo Sunho might be smiling from above,

487
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,576
seeing you and Cha Deokhui
doing well together.

488
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:02,914
You're doing well, right?

489
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,375
I'm not sure.

490
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,298
When people sometimes ask me
if I'd want to go back to being young,

491
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,468
I'd flat out say no and wave it off.

492
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:16,969
But...

493
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:22,183
when it was you, the late Sunho,
Deokhui, and me, all together...

494
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,601
I sometimes wish I could go back,

495
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,771
just for a moment, to our college days.

496
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,316
Do you...

497
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,193
miss those days?

498
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,695
I don't miss those days.

499
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,447
I miss us back then.

500
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,118
Hey, drop me off
at that subway station up there.

501
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,093
I see a doll.

502
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,179
What kind of doll is it?

503
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,640
A dog...

504
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,520
Its head moves.

505
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,356
Bobbing up...

506
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,608
and down.

507
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,070
What color is the dog?

508
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,870
<i>A black dog.</i>

509
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:26,998
<i>No.</i>

510
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,583
<i>A white dog.</i>

511
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,170
<i>Wait...</i>

512
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,213
<i>It's spotted.</i>

513
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,800
<i>Black...</i>

514
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,803
<i>White...</i>

515
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,807
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

516
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,439
The doll disappeared.

517
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,194
Who's driving?

518
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:58,988
I am.

519
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,283
I'm speeding up.

520
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:05,828
I have to hurry.

521
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,166
Can you glance at the seat next to you?

522
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,215
A man is sleeping.

523
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,801
My father...

524
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,678
No, wait...

525
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,098
It's me.

526
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,810
Then who's driving?

527
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,565
Because it's pouring...

528
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,285
<i>Someone else is driving
because of the rain?</i>

529
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,371
<i>No.</i>

530
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,457
<i>Because of the heavy rain,</i>

531
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,002
<i>I have to drive carefully.</i>

532
00:45:58,506 --> 00:45:59,548
<i>Wait.</i>

533
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,301
<i>I don't know how to drive.</i>

534
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,365
<i>There's a little girl in the back.</i>

535
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,660
<i>Who is she?</i>

536
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,289
I don't know.

537
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,790
But...

538
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,834
<i>it's a child...</i>

539
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,295
<i>I know.</i>

540
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,090
What is she doing?

541
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,759
Sleeping.

542
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,763
<i>Even with all the rain,</i>

543
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,225
<i>she's sleeping so soundly.</i>

544
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,485
Seo Dongju.

545
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,364
Seong Hyeon.

546
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,989
<i>You're keeping quiet
because you're afraid</i>

547
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,993
Chairman Cha will get his hands on
the two trillion won in Seo Dongju's head

548
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,579
now that it's up for grabs, aren't you?

549
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:00,294
You might lose it all.
Better to sacrifice half than lose it all.

550
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,848
Yes, it's me.

551
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,644
<i>Worried about the general election?</i>

552
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,231
This isn't our first election, sir.

553
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,151
Yes, the funds are enough.

554
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,737
This is exactly why we set up

555
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,992
that National Patriotism Fund
in Switzerland, for times like this.

556
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,745
Yes.

557
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,914
You can trust me.

558
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,791
You have to trust me.

559
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,377
My goodness.

560
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,797
I have an urgent call coming in.

561
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,549
Yes.

562
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,928
Understood, sir.

563
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,694
{\an8}PRESIDENT HUH ILDO

564
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,363
Yes, Ildo.

565
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,782
How was your night?

566
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:16,369
So, how's our two-trillion-won guest

567
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,372
settling into your place?

568
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,502
Hypnotherapy?

569
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,422
<i>Do you think that will work?</i>

570
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:30,968
I believe it could be the key

571
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,512
to unlocking his memory, sir.

572
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,514
All right.

573
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,057
Hey, Guho.

574
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,730
The Elder wants his money.
And our dear junior Ildo?

575
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,442
He's busy hypnotizing
a brain worth two trillion won.

576
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:50,696
Does he think that kind of therapy
will bring Dongju's memory back?

577
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,407
My fate must be cursed.

578
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,120
I might as well stab myself
for my stupidity.

579
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,958
Keeping that useless Ildo around
all this time,

580
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,337
it's beyond pathetic.

581
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,381
Sir.

582
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,885
The shock made him lose his memory.

583
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,763
A similar shock
might bring his memory back.

584
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,934
Sorry, sir.

585
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,436
You just seemed frustrated.

586
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,274
Cheon Guho.

587
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,195
That's not entirely a bad idea.

588
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,325
Yes. You're right.

589
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:43,207
I should storm in unannounced
and smash his head with a hammer.

590
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,427
Uncle.

591
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,971
Hey. Heading to work?

592
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,098
Yes, Uncle.

593
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,015
And your wife?

594
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,309
She's coming.
We're having breakfast at the main house.

595
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,395
Okay.

596
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,273
Eunnam, we need to talk for a moment.

597
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:14,863
What's going on?

598
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,074
I'm not sure.

599
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,995
I heard my father-in-law found Seo Dongju.

600
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,414
Where has he been?

601
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,125
I'm sorry. I have no idea.

602
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,669
You should go in. He's waiting.

603
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,754
Okay.

604
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,491
Don't do it!

605
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,000
Mr. Seo!

606
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,003
Mr. Seo.

607
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,424
Mr. Seo!

608
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,724
If you're not hurt, I'll leave you alone.

609
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,033
<i>I'm Yeo Eunnam.</i>

610
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,743
<i>Can we talk?</i>

611
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,897
I see. Then it might be
a bit much for him today.

612
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:17,486
No. I only told Sister Agnes
that Dongju was safe.

613
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,116
Please discuss it with him
and get back to me. I'll be waiting.

614
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,449
Hey...

615
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,203
When did you start practicing
hypnotherapy?

616
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,541
If you don't mind,
I'd like to know your experience.

617
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,587
Well...

618
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,506
Before I got my medical license.

619
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,344
I started doing hypnotherapy
before I became a doctor.

620
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,602
You saw the scars on my body before.

621
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,147
They're gunshot wounds.

622
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,195
I keep recalling a memory
of President Huh shooting me.

623
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,280
I feel very confused right now.

624
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,282
It has to be a false memory.

625
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,410
I heard from Mr. Huh.

626
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,332
On top of that,

627
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,169
I keep having the same nightmare.

628
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,130
Hmm.

629
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,510
I'll help

630
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,014
as much as I can.

631
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,768
Mr. Huh sincerely wants my help too.

632
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,398
You heard about your sister, right?

633
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,775
Yes.

634
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,401
She's a nun.

635
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,238
Would you like to meet her today?

636
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,006
Dongju.

637
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:48,428
She's at the chrysanthemum festival.

638
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,099
She's a horticulture expert.
You know, flowers and trees.

639
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,664
She needed a few chrysanthemum pots,

640
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,292
so I offered to deliver them
and arranged to meet her here.

641
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,087
Where is she?

642
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,555
Over there.

643
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,852
Yes, that's Sister Agnes.

644
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,130
Dongju!

645
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:30,674
Seo Dongju!

646
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,928
<i>Seong Hyeon!</i>

647
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,431
Mom!

648
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,629
<i>I don't believe in hypnosis.</i>

649
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,756
<i>Let's face this head-on.</i>

650
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,759
<i>The memory wiped out by shock.</i>

651
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,262
<i>A stronger shock will bring it back.</i>

652
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,017
<i>That's the proper way to do it.</i>

653
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,749
Buried Hearts

654
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,460
{\an8}<i>How did a nobody
and the great Yeom Jangseon</i>

655
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,254
{\an8}<i>get tangled up like this?</i>

656
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,048
{\an8}<i>Could it be that</i>

657
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,551
{\an8}Director Seo's memory returned
from the shock of his sister's death?

658
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,970
{\an8}My two trillion won
is in that head of yours!

659
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,680
{\an8}<i>I'm not okay at all.</i>

660
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,016
{\an8}This pain is unbearable,
I feel like dying.

661
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,934
{\an8}<i>Not even the death of his sister</i>

662
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,686
{\an8}could bring back his memory!

663
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,273
{\an8}<i>The truck driver who caused
the accident vanished without a trace.</i>

664
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,734
{\an8}<i>My false memories of you,
President Huh,</i>

665
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,403
will be cleared up soon too,

666
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,322
<i>one by one.</i>
