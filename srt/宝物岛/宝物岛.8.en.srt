CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,591
You thief.

5
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,761
My two trillion won
is in that head of yours!

6
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,395
What money?

7
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:02,980
You...

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,900
You took the money I was going to use

9
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,860
for my love of this country.

10
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,380
Why are you so shocked?

11
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,674
Didn't you bring this to kill me?

12
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,428
Honestly, I'm tired
of chasing my memories.

13
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,222
And I'm left alone in this world.

14
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,349
I'm done.

15
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,476
It's all so exhausting.

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,104
So...

17
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,232
I'll disappear with the two trillion

18
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,359
stuck in my head.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,820
I was wrong!

20
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,073
You didn't steal my money.

21
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,075
It's a misunderstanding...

22
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:00,578
Are you sure?

23
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,332
Why would I lie with a gun in front of me?

24
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,877
Do you want me to kneel and beg?

25
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,213
Do you?

26
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,143
{\an8}EPISODE 8

27
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,211
Sir.

28
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,848
Sir.

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,518
You should head to the main house.

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,690
If you're sleeping here,
I'll prepare your bedding.

31
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,777
Guho.

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,576
We need to prepare some cinnamon.

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,424
<i>You mentioned
Seo Dongju nearly died</i>

35
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,260
<i>from a cinnamon allergy back then, right?</i>

36
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,847
<i>Yes, sir. Any later,
and it would've been fatal.</i>

37
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:46,935
Seo Dongju is getting too cocky.
It's a real nuisance.

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,314
Prepare enough
to send him off smoothly in one go.

39
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,233
Cinnamon.

40
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,930
CASSIA CINNAMON

41
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,646
Make sure

42
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,982
everything goes smoothly.

43
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,612
If you fail and
Seo Dongju regains all his memories,

44
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,908
you'll be headed straight to prison
for attempted murder.

45
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,369
Don't forget that, Ildo.

46
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,501
What if he realizes there's cinnamon in it

47
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,669
and doesn't eat it?

48
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,422
That's a great question.

49
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,926
If he's putting on an amnesia act,

50
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,470
you should get rid of him straightaway.

51
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,806
You already failed to kill him once.

52
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,434
It's only right
that you finish the job, isn't it?

53
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,855
If you need a gun,
I can provide one again.

54
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,571
I'll make sure...

55
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,159
everything is wrapped up the right way.

56
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:48,974
Mmm...

57
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,559
It's good.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,810
Tell Director Seo

59
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,813
to come down and join us for dinner.

60
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,274
We have such great food here.

61
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,234
I will.

62
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,791
Dongju!

63
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,960
Dongju!

64
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,463
- Call an ambulance.
- Dongju!

65
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,591
Yes, Father.

66
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,385
Dongju.

67
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,514
We have a medical emergency
at 19-1 Hannam-dong. Please come quickly.

68
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,766
- What's going on?
- Stay with me, Dongju!

69
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,143
What's going on?

70
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,145
Dongju.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,731
Dongju!

72
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,399
Stay with me.

73
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,152
Dongju, stay with me!

74
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,323
Director Seo!

75
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,700
- Dongju.
- What's going on?

76
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,409
Director Seo!

77
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,329
Dongju, stay with me...

78
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,123
Dongju, stay with me!

79
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,628
Dongju!

80
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,547
Dongju, stay with me!

81
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,799
Dongju!

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,719
Stay with me!

83
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,387
Dongju...

84
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,181
Dongju, stay with me...

85
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,017
Dongju!

86
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,157
Director Seo!

87
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,241
Dongju!

88
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,702
- Dongju!
- Director Seo!

89
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,110
When is the ambulance getting here?

90
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,570
I'll go check.

91
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,738
Call and hurry them up.

92
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,824
Yes, Grandfather.

93
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,122
Is this emergency services?

94
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,844
I'll go.

95
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,812
Let's follow Director Seo. Get ready.

96
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,938
Yes, Grandfather.

97
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,608
Taeyun, I'll take him.

98
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,622
Yes, Aunt.

99
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,916
Huicheol.

100
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,422
I called to check
if your in-laws liked the food.

101
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,259
Whether they liked the food
is the least of our worries.

102
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,805
The cookies caused some serious trouble.

103
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,311
Honey!

104
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:28,108
After I spoke with Huicheol,
I checked the kitchen right away.

105
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,028
It's definitely cassia cinnamon.

106
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,198
I've never brought
Ceylon cinnamon into this house.

107
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,949
How on earth did this happen?

108
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,119
I'll vouch for your innocence.

109
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,579
I'll visit Director Seo

110
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,041
and encourage him
to pull through on your behalf too.

111
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,210
Are you saying

112
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,754
that he might die?

113
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,634
Oh, no.

114
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,725
Seo Dongju ate the cookies even after
hearing they had cinnamon in them.

115
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,602
Guess the amnesia

116
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,062
isn't an act, right?

117
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,147
Yes, sir.

118
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,778
<i>It doesn't look like
Director Seo will recover.</i>

119
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,947
Code Blue.

120
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,074
- Doctor, call a Code Blue.
- Yes, got it.

121
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,534
- Epinephrine!
- Yes!

122
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,745
<i>Code Blue!</i>

123
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,999
150 joules.

124
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,420
It's ready.

125
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,965
Shock!

126
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,761
- Charge 200 joules.
- Charge 200 joules.

127
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,222
It's ready.

128
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,598
Shock.

129
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,393
<i>Seo Dongju's real name</i>

130
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,146
<i>is Chu Seonghyeon.</i>

131
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,773
<i>Seonghyeon.</i>

132
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,067
<i>It's time for you to go.</i>

133
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,320
Only if you die

134
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,659
will our tangled fate finally end here.

135
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,873
Welcome, Ildo!

136
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,175
What is this?

137
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,846
They're gifts from Chairman Cha, sir.

138
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,432
Not that.

139
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,982
Why is a Daesan employee in my house?

140
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:01,178
{\an8}<i>I couldn't comply
with your request to fire Seo Dongju,</i>

141
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,390
<i>so I'm sending small gifts
along with this handwritten letter.</i>

142
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,976
<i>I hope you'll be understanding.</i>

143
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,105
<i>As for the slush fund my son-in-law
siphoned off to win your favor,</i>

144
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,441
<i>let's consider it forgotten.</i>

145
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,319
Guho, take in the gifts.

146
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,739
Thank you, Mr. Yeom.

147
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,866
Sir.

148
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,118
From now on, call me "sir."

149
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,329
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,289
Come in, Ildo.

151
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,673
DAESAN HOSPITAL

152
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,675
Secretary Gong!

153
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,095
Tell Secretary Gong to bring some tea.

154
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,304
Father!

155
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,849
We're at the hospital.

156
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,323
You should...

157
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,283
go home.

158
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,702
You'll collapse at this rate.

159
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,331
- Can you take him...
- Even if he goes back,

160
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,084
he won't rest easy
worrying about Director Seo.

161
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,712
Is Director Seo
more important than your health?

162
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,255
What's wrong with you guys?

163
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,841
Director Seo is important.

164
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,642
I need to go check on a patient.

165
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,063
You have to go back soon, okay?

166
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,868
I'm disappointed in you.

167
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,414
About his dementia.

168
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,333
Well...

169
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,295
He's just tired
from what happened to Director Seo.

170
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,964
He's totally fine...

171
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,596
Did you catch on?

172
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,516
He was so adamant about keeping it secret.

173
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,560
I couldn't even tell my wife.

174
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,729
You did the right thing.

175
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,856
From now on,

176
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,358
you must discuss his condition with me.

177
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,111
It's for Daesan.

178
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,698
Obviously for you and Daesan Hospital too.

179
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,368
Okay.

180
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,749
Sir.

181
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,964
- Hi, Ildo.
- Hello.

182
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,050
Why a hospital room and not the morgue?

183
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,135
Well...

184
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,097
It's a room for the chairman to rest.

185
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,642
Director Seo
won't make it through the night.

186
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,785
Doctor, his rhythm is back!

187
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,465
Father.

188
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,551
He has no family to handle it.

189
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,012
We should start preparing the funeral...

190
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,516
Yes,
I cared about that young man too.

191
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,604
I will gladly put my name
on the funeral committee list, Chairman.

192
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,066
Why are you rushing ahead?

193
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,152
Director Seo isn't dead yet.

194
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,071
It'll be tough for him to recover.

195
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,080
Director Seo!

196
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,011
Everyone, please leave the room.

197
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,223
The patient needs complete rest, Chairman.

198
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,326
He's past the worst for now
since he's breathing on his own.

199
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,914
It's thanks to Eunnam's
proper first response with CPR.

200
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,751
This happened
after he ate the food sent from my family,

201
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,712
so I feel absolutely devastated.

202
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,047
Then this allergic reaction

203
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,842
won't threaten
Director Seo's life anymore?

204
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,888
No. We still need
to monitor him further, but for now,

205
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
he'll live.

206
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,852
It'll take some time
for him to regain consciousness.

207
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,396
But his eyes were open.

208
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,025
Physiological functions
are working.

209
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,487
But there's no response
to cognitive stimuli, so...

210
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,488
we need to wait and see.

211
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,785
Then has he gotten worse
than when he lost his memory?

212
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,789
Dongju!

213
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm Seo Dongju's guardian.

214
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,875
The patient who just came in?

215
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,797
Director Seo's guardian is here now.
Let's head down for now.

216
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,935
Dongju can't have cinnamon.

217
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,274
I'll take it from here.
Thank you so much.

218
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,866
Seong Hyeon.

219
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,827
You must get back up.

220
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,913
You can't give up right now.

221
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,088
Are you Yeo Eunnam?

222
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,634
Hold on.

223
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,639
This is pretty much dead,

224
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,226
but I kept it because of the video inside.

225
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,312
It might not play anymore, though.

226
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,024
In any case,
it was originally meant for you.

227
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,527
There were some circumstances.

228
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,781
Hear it from him when he wakes up.

229
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,867
Oh, right.

230
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,912
Have a look at this when you're alone.

231
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,425
Come on. Wake up. Eunnam is here too.

232
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
Gosh.

233
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,743
<i>Why are you trying
to kill Dongju?</i>

234
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,871
<i>The day you told me</i>

235
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,124
<i>to arrange a meeting
between Dongju and his sister,</i>

236
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,543
<i>she died.</i>

237
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,546
Got something to say?

238
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,549
No.

239
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,351
<i>I'll give it a go.</i>

240
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,982
<i>It's a mess from the start.</i>

241
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>I'll start.</i>

242
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,632
<i>That's it.</i>

243
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>I didn't practice the rest.</i>

244
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,927
<i>I wanted to master it</i>

245
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,806
and play it for you whenever you wanted...

246
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,689
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

247
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,743
<i>This is the chairman's recipe
that's more precious than wild ginseng.</i>

248
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,828
<i>Soju with raw eggs.</i>

249
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>Almost forgot.</i>

250
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,879
<i>Ta-da.</i>

251
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,340
<i>I got it fixed.</i>

252
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,426
<i>The shop said the gems were still intact.</i>

253
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,604
I need water.

254
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,439
Okay.

255
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,709
How about
getting pretty tattoos on our wrists?

256
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,419
What?

257
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,881
I've been wanting to do it
for a long time.

258
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,104
Looks like she's really scared.

259
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,565
Looks like a no.

260
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,738
Then I'll go first
and see if it hurts or not.

261
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,448
If it's bad, don't do it.

262
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,909
Dongju, why would you? What's the point?

263
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,412
You won't know if it hurts until you try.

264
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,748
Wait outside.

265
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,376
I'll go first.

266
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,258
The sketch...

267
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,406
You're a scaredy-cat
afraid of tattoo needles.

268
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,077
How did you hurt your wrist like that?

269
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,456
It was a mistake.

270
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,001
I was trying to mess
with my stepdad and mom,

271
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,921
but I ended up screwing myself over.

272
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,553
Thanks, Dongju.

273
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,556
For putting an end to my embarrassment.

274
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,652
It really didn't hurt much.

275
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,239
Really?

276
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,658
It didn't hurt?

277
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,452
Did it hurt for you?

278
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,371
Yeah.

279
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,331
I'm never doing it again.

280
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,181
<i>I told Dongju</i>

281
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,224
<i>that I'd curse you out for him. But...</i>

282
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,144
Pray for her in my stead.

283
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,229
Pray that she stays

284
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,482
healthy and happy.

285
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,203
PROSECUTION

286
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,287
She's here!

287
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
- She's coming!
- She's here!

288
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,551
Do you admit

289
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,597
to lobbying bank executives
to win the Yuseong Chemical M&A?

290
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,599
But I...

291
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,439
{\an8}DAESAN CHEMICAL CEO CHA GUKHUI
APPEARS BEFORE PROSECUTORS

292
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,819
Why show up at
the prosecutors' office now

293
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,903
after avoiding summons?

294
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,239
Are you only here
because of warrant threats?

295
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,742
How do you feel right now?

296
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,037
Please tell us.
Is it yes or no?

297
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,888
<i>Daesan Chemical's CEO Cha Gukhui sped off</i>

298
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,058
<i>from the scene like she was fleeing,
driving the car herself.</i>

299
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,563
<i>According to the prosecution,
CEO Cha entered through another entrance...</i>

300
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,107
What kind of stunt is this?

301
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,608
Did you ask him why?

302
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,737
He hasn't been taking my calls for days.

303
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:43,912
MR. YEOM

304
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,376
Yes, sir.

305
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,211
Give me.

306
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,301
Cha Gangcheon speaking.

307
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,428
Are you aware that you're cutting open

308
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,347
the goose that lays
the golden eggs for you?

309
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,558
Gosh, Chairman.

310
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,354
Do you think I'd be dumb enough
to gut the goose that lays golden eggs?

311
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,483
I'm hurt that you'd think so low of me.

312
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,819
You set up
the Yuseong Chemical takeover for us,

313
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,989
so why hand my daughter
over to the prosecution?

314
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,159
Turn Cha Gukhui over to the prosecution?

315
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,369
It wasn't my doing.

316
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,705
Chairman?

317
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,000
I figured you'd be upset about that.

318
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,545
That's actually
why I called President Huh.

319
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,716
<i>Cha Gukhui needs to cooperate
with the prosecution's investigation,</i>

320
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,177
<i>or she could end up getting detained.</i>

321
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,596
I'll hang up now.

322
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,018
Cha Gukhui is staying silent,
playing defense at the prosecution.

323
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,354
We don't need Cha Gukhui's testimony.

324
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:55,150
It's crucial that Cha Gangcheon feels
the threat of his daughter being taken.

325
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,529
We should've ditched
the two trillion won in Seo Dongju's head

326
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,951
and focused on taking over Daesan instead

327
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,869
long ago.

328
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,962
I booked the private room.

329
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,880
Why are you sitting here?

330
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,298
You don't have much time.

331
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,385
Right. I do need to
head back soon, but still...

332
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,762
Just <i>jajangmyeon?</i>

333
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,348
Did you

334
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,144
call me out all of a sudden because of
your aunt going to the prosecution?

335
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,688
No.

336
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,439
I see.

337
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,776
Let's eat first. I'm hungry.

338
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,405
She'll be fine.
She's got my uncle, after all.

339
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,614
Wait...

340
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,909
I'll barely have the time
to finish the food.

341
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,287
Mmm...

342
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,000
By the way,

343
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,418
you'll see me later at home tonight.

344
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,379
Why meet during a tight lunch break?

345
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm not going home tonight.

346
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:11,768
Let's get a divorce.

347
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,046
I should head back.

348
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,357
I'm sure

349
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,110
you have thought about divorce
for many days.

350
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,404
But I'm hearing it now.

351
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,367
You didn't expect me
to just agree to divorce

352
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,496
right away, did you?

353
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,584
Also, I...

354
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,259
I like you more than you think, Eunnam.

355
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,263
I'm not divorcing you.

356
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:32,849
I won't.

357
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,781
It's not because I've started hating you.

358
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,124
If we get a divorce, all those
Daesan shares from your grandfather...

359
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,464
You'd have to give them back.

360
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,010
Are you okay with that?

361
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,515
Yes.

362
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,365
<i>Do you mean
Sister Agnes' car accident?</i>

363
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,368
The police asked for copies
of the CCTV footage back then,

364
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,205
so I copied all three spots.

365
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,790
But they said
they didn't need it soon after,

366
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,919
so I just shoved it somewhere.

367
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,378
Where did I put it?

368
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,548
Yes, it's here.

369
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,508
Yes.

370
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,594
Here.

371
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,320
Eunnam.

372
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:51,947
Hey.

373
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,574
Are you busy? Heading somewhere?

374
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,793
Eunnam, you...

375
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,503
I'm sorry, Mom.

376
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,998
<i>The day
you didn't show up for our trip,</i>

377
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,293
I got shot on the yacht
and lost my memory.

378
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,360
<i>I wanted to master it</i>

379
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,781
<i>and play it for you whenever you wanted...</i>

380
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm hungry.

381
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,320
Your mom and I talked about you.

382
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,281
I'm against the divorce.

383
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,244
Your grandfather
is starting to show signs of dementia.

384
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,164
Stress and shocks
are the last things he needs.

385
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,500
I'll...

386
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,086
I'll talk to him carefully.

387
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,755
Breaking the prenup

388
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,300
comes with a hefty penalty.

389
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,845
It's way more than the shares
you got when you got married.

390
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,556
<i>This is the chairman's recipe...</i>

391
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,862
I'll tell Prosecutor Yeom to come.

392
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,739
Go back with him.

393
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,683
DAESAN CHEMICAL CEO CHA GUKHUI
FACING ARREST

394
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,187
{\an8}BANK DENIES DAESAN ENERGY'S CREDIT LETTER

395
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,323
It's only a matter of time
before Daesan Group falls into our hands.

396
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,577
<i>I can't help but resent
the foolish days when we clung to</i>

397
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,831
<i>the measly two trillion won
tied up with Seo Dongju.</i>

398
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,792
If there's a hitch
in the crude oil import reserves,

399
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,961
things could get serious, sir.

400
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,506
<i>That's exactly
what we're waiting for.</i>

401
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,095
<i>A fixer who unlocks frozen funds
and fills empty oil tanks.</i>

402
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,558
<i>You, President Huh,
will step in to save Daesan Group.</i>

403
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,394
I'm on my way to meet The Elder.

404
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,148
{\an8}I'll go drive in the final wedge.

405
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,457
You're saying we should split up Daesan
and hand it over to another group?

406
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,085
I'm not saying
we should tear Daesan Group apart.

407
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,003
I'm saying

408
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:22,132
we put Huh Ildo at the top of Daesan
because he's obedient to me.

409
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,260
The one obedient to you...

410
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,430
No, obedient to us.

411
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,186
With just the National Patriotism Fund
we set up in Switzerland,

412
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,439
I have plenty to play politics my way.

413
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,733
Your way?

414
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,279
No, it's the politics we want.

415
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,032
Mr. President.

416
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,411
You just serve a five-year term,
but what about after that?

417
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,622
And after that?

418
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,337
Your laid-back, naive attitude and ideas...

419
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,261
Let me put it this way.

420
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,724
Lee Cheolyong is one selfish bastard.

421
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,702
Hello, sir.

422
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,626
I'll get going now.

423
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,336
Okay.

424
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,213
Chairman...

425
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,632
I'd like to see Director Seo.

426
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,843
Could I visit him in the hospital?

427
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,428
He won't recognize you.

428
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,723
All this time,
I just heard he was a little sick

429
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:57,352
and would return once he recovered,
so I've been just waiting.

430
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,979
But now I feel like

431
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,773
I've been too indifferent
as his direct superior.

432
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,859
It's fine.

433
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,738
Besides, you're not
Director Seo's direct superior anymore.

434
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,656
You have Daesan Group to run.

435
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,491
Just focus on your job.

436
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,162
Yes, I'll hurry
to convene the board meeting.

437
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,247
Okay.

438
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,300
I'm pushing forward

439
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,012
with Chief Choi's promotion
to group vice chairman.

440
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,305
Pardon?

441
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,975
I decided it a while ago,
but it's been delayed.

442
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,354
With all the buzz around Daesan Energy,
now's the perfect time.

443
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,439
Father.

444
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,108
You didn't even discuss it with me.

445
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:02,876
On one hand,

446
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,921
you're my son-in-law,
the man Deokhui loves.

447
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,425
On the other,
you're Yeom Jangseon's trusted apprentice.

448
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,179
You're valuable to me in both ways.

449
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,016
But you being Yeom's favored junior

450
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,894
doesn't hold much value for me now.

451
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,399
Go confront Yeom Jangseon head-on.

452
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,150
Father.

453
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,986
Make yourself a junior he fears.

454
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,906
Create a new half of your usefulness.

455
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,785
Yeom Jangseon can't shake me.

456
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,626
Once Chief Choi becomes vice chairman
and Director Seo returns,

457
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,920
everything will be resolved.

458
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,464
Once Seo Dongju returns,

459
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,634
everything will be resolved.

460
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,435
CHAIRMAN'S SECRETARIAT CHOI GIHYEON

461
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,909
It's the chairman's order.

462
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,996
Call an emergency board meeting...

463
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,915
Hold on, I'll call you back.

464
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,878
President Huh.

465
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,845
Have a seat.

466
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,392
Listen to what I'm about to say

467
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,145
without misunderstanding.

468
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,274
The chairman's not in great health.

469
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,903
What? He seemed fine when I saw him.

470
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,155
Physically,

471
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,324
he's still holding up all right.

472
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,035
Then what's...

473
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,831
Yes.

474
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,167
For now, he still recognizes us.

475
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,211
But we don't know how long that'll last.

476
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,672
Your promotion to vice chairman...

477
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,259
He might not remember approving it.

478
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,058
From now on,

479
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,895
you need to discuss
all group matters with me first.

480
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,079
Gosh.

481
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,040
You're here.

482
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,709
We are coming back from the herbal clinic.

483
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,044
I see.

484
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,964
Lately, Eunnam hasn't been eating well,
and I was worried.

485
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,049
For a moment,

486
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,678
I dared to hope that maybe
our ancestors had blessed Huicheol

487
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,807
with a child.

488
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,892
Well, it turns out it's not the case.

489
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,813
The ancestors urge us
to put in more effort.

490
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,982
Hurry and bring him inside.

491
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,108
Well, I'll be off.

492
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:14,235
Okay.

493
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,913
Thanks for hanging in there
and sticking it out, Eunnam.

494
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,126
I'm working on getting
the money to pay the penalty

495
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,628
for breaking the marriage.

496
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,310
Eunnam, I didn't kill...

497
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,522
your father, Yeo Sunho.

498
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,656
That's a lie.

499
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,169
I took a half-day and left work early.

500
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,255
I heard my aunt took you
to the herbal clinic.

501
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,925
You must be tired from the trip.

502
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,351
My aunt got ahead of herself today,

503
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,729
but maybe we should start
putting in some effort...

504
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,823
Even if we have a child,
I still want a divorce.

505
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,034
Huicheol.

506
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,627
I can't afford to consider your feelings.

507
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,796
I'm only...

508
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,672
thinking about myself.

509
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,592
If we had a kid,
it'd give me more strength...

510
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,554
more reason to hold on to you.

511
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,223
That's what I think.

512
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,184
Why did you quit rugby?

513
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,394
What?

514
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,772
You said you used
your uncle's influence to kick Seo Dongju,

515
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,942
the guy you hated most, off the team.

516
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,904
Did it get boring without him?

517
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,531
Do we have to talk about him right now?

518
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,033
- Huicheol.
- What?

519
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,163
You liked me the moment you saw me.
Practically in ten seconds.

520
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,840
In one second.

521
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,758
I thought, "What a jackpot."

522
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,886
My uncle told me
that I had to marry you no matter what.

523
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,598
He was half threatening me
when I went to meet you.

524
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,437
But you came because your grandfather
promised you stocks for marrying me.

525
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,399
You said it wasn't a bad start
since I seemed to like you.

526
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,322
Marrying me for stocks,
that sounded like you wanted...

527
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,034
my deep love...

528
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,329
to me.

529
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,289
I was nuts.

530
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,001
After you found out
I'd been with Seo Dongju,

531
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:21,046
I stopped being a woman to you
and became a trophy

532
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,048
from your competition with Dongju.

533
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:26,134
Yes, when I found out
the girl I fell for at first sight

534
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,844
dumped that thug and picked me,

535
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,972
I was over the moon.

536
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:32,516
What's wrong with that?

537
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,062
I'm going to wash up.

538
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,106
Let's have dinner at the main house.

539
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,026
Your aunt is making eel soup.

540
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,323
We'll talk more after dinner.

541
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:44,296
{\an8}UNCLE-IN-LAW

542
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,534
What?

543
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,246
Nine...

544
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:07,796
Goodness.

545
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,222
It's no use, Gukhui.

546
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,890
Ildo...

547
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,320
Come sit.

548
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,749
How long have you been

549
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,460
taking the dollars from there?

550
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:53,591
Are you saying the money in this safe
isn't from the Korea Mint

551
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,762
but from the US Federal Reserve?

552
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,598
My goodness.

553
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,104
That note...

554
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,440
I found it by pure chance.

555
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,900
I found it in Father's pencil holder.

556
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,277
When?

557
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,405
When did I find it? Well...

558
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,073
Just yesterday.

559
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,286
Or the day before.

560
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,499
Or the day before that.

561
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,919
Or the day way before...

562
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,170
Ildo!

563
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,006
You know the new safe code, right?

564
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,092
Aren't you here
to steal from that safe too?

565
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,722
I guess we could go confess to your father

566
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,057
and get scolded together.

567
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:45,393
I won't tell anyone you were here.

568
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,061
What about you being here?

569
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,022
Can I go blab about it everywhere?

570
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,149
Whatever you want.

571
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,443
Ildo.

572
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,236
I'm about to get dragged
to the prosecution

573
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:58,281
and detained on behalf of Daesan!

574
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,366
Do you understand?

575
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,161
Neither Father nor you could care less,
and I was so fed up,

576
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,206
I figured I'd grab some cash.
So I came for my first time today.

577
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,927
Let's both

578
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,513
keep this a secret.

579
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,034
{\an8}LIQUOR SAFE
INNER SAFE

580
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,521
Looks like Ildo doesn't know
the safe code either.

581
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,650
The code worked fine until yesterday,

582
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,486
so who changed it?

583
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,697
Father?

584
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,910
The day the chairman had Seo Dongju
deliver the money to you

585
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,830
to ask you to halt the Daesan Energy sale,

586
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,165
{\an8}after he took the dollars out,

587
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:35,044
he must've changed
the code to one only he knows.

588
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:39,633
Then it was changed
not long ago, wasn't it?

589
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,679
You should've made your move
before he did that.

590
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,807
<i>Ildo.</i>

591
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,850
You're not holding out hope

592
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:52,479
that Seo Dongju will recover
and hand over the safe code, right?

593
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,815
No, sir.

594
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,608
<i>Okay, that's good to hear.</i>

595
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,196
I was worried that you might
be hesitating right before the big move.

596
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:04,867
Just a pointless concern.

597
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:18,464
CHAIRMAN CHA GANGCHEON

598
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,069
<i>Chairman Huh Ildo
of Daesan Group.</i>

599
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,283
I thought about giving you a gun,

600
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,704
but I prepared something easier
and more effective, Chairman Huh.

601
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,392
I'll make sure

602
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,521
everything is...

603
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,608
wrapped up the right way.

604
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,917
That's always the problem.

605
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,253
Hand me the screwdriver.

606
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,462
MR. YEOM

607
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,548
More to the left.

608
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,263
Yes, sir.

609
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,098
Yes.

610
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,434
Yes.

611
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,565
I understand how you feel.

612
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:04,695
But isn't it reasonable to assume
that Seo Dongju killed Cho Yangchun?

613
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,240
<i>He's not the kind
who'd give up his life that easily.</i>

614
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,908
Administrator.

615
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,704
Losing manpower
for the sake of our country isn't new.

616
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,873
It's happened time and again.

617
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,504
Let go of Cho Yangchun

618
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,507
and focus on the next task.

619
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:27,676
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

620
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,762
When we complete this mission,

621
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:36,101
I'll make sure Cho Yangchun's family
lives off rent money for life.

622
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,028
The job's been started.

623
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:47,988
Okay.

624
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,123
This is Manager Cheon.

625
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,918
Mr. Yeom wants
to have dinner out together.

626
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:07,341
So, is it just going to be me,
Huicheol, and Mr. Yeom?

627
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:08,883
<i>Yes.</i>

628
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:13,722
Go ahead first. Mr. Yeom will join you
with Prosecutor Yeom.

629
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,945
UNCLE-IN-LAW

630
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,919
<i>I got your photos.</i>

631
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,215
<i>Let's talk about it in person.</i>

632
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:54,137
I'll give you the original photos
after I get a divorce without the penalty.

633
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,101
Cheon Guho is my guy.

634
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,144
But your father, Huh Ildo...

635
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,314
has got nothing to do with me.

636
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:09,443
So why should I take a loss and agree
to your divorce without the penalty?

637
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,779
I know you're trying to

638
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,408
make Huh Ildo
the chairman of Daesan Group.

639
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:19,371
Just the suspicion
that Huh Ildo shot at a Daesan director

640
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,666
would make huge headlines.

641
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:35,011
I understand very well
what my niece-in-law is asking for.

642
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,284
Hello.

643
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,787
You always show up on time
for the shift change.

644
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:44,038
I'm usually late.

645
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,707
I'm happy with the overtime pay.

646
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,668
He probably won't wake up till morning.

647
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,087
I handled the bathroom duty.

648
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,465
Please keep an eye on him while you rest.

649
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,550
Okay.

650
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,146
Take care.

651
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,565
- Good night.
- Good night.

652
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,260

659

{\an8}<i>He's a dangerous guy,</i>

661
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,457
