{\an8}different from the materials
submitted this morning?

00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,454
Mr. Huh Ildo, keep that up
and you'll end up in prison.

8
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,165
Are you going to keep giving
false testimony?

9
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,503
Honorable Assemblyman Nam Sangcheol,

10
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,838
while leading Daesan Energy,

11
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,801
due to unfortunate circumstances,
I once went to prison.

12
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,681
That's when I realized
I should never commit a crime.

13
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,308
Prison is an awful place.

14
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,810
Never commit a crime.

15
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,062
Mr. Huh Ildo.

16
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,231
Yes, Assemblywoman Seok.

17
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,941
This is
a National Assembly hearing.

18
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,611
We're not here
to listen to your personal stories.

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,614
Keep that in mind.

<i>You said you could end this hearing.
What happened?</i>

30
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,115
A report claimed that

31
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,784
over 1 trillion won
was funneled to the Osar tribe

32
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,744
for oil exploration rights.

33
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,246
<i>Wasn't it all for nothing?</i>

34
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,415

Mmm.

The anchovies taste the same.

38
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,439
The price has fallen to 400,000 won,
so I thought it wouldn't be as good.

39
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,025
<i>And the oil exploration company</i>

40
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,321

<i>One more slip, and it's trouble.</i>

44
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,290
they provided
different materials like these.

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,292
Let's move on.

46
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,878
This energy project
has been riddled with issues

47
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,671
from the very beginning.

48
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,881
Assemblywoman Seok.

49
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,091
This energy project was carried out

50
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,846
because the National Assembly
approved the related laws and budget

51
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,139
two years ago.

52
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,392
Daesan Energy is simply
a project implementation partner.

53
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,895
Mr. Huh Ildo,

54
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,271
this is my time to speak.

55
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,108
If you have comments,
request a separate speaking slot.

56
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,870
What? Who the hell is that?

57
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,454
What is it?

58
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,207
Someone's sitting on the stairs.

59
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,292
What?

60
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,966
That persistent guy!

61
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,845
How did he know I'd come here?

62
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,231
Tiger!

63
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,777
I heard you canceled your district event,
so I came hoping to meet you, sir.

64
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,866
Director Seo,
I get my dress shirts custom-made.

65
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,950
Okay?

66
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:12,621
Did you chase me down at this hour
just to give me some cheap fabric?

67
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,749
These are a bit different.

68
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,418
Sir, please take a closer look.

69
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,838
Damn it. You should just go.

70
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,882
I'm extremely tired...

71
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,426
- Gosh.
- What?

72
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,220
Isn't this American?

73
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,846
Made in the USA!

74
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,931
Gosh!

75
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,476
Wait, hold on. Then this one too?

76
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,855
Such a precious gift...

77
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,440
My goodness.

78
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,483
Listen.

79
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,568
Tell Chairman Cha Gangcheon

80
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,239
that the dress shirts fit me perfectly,

81
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,283
as if tailored for me.

82
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,368
The chairman asks

83
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:55,415
that you adjourn the hearing
at an appropriate time.

84
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,917
Adjourn the hearing?

85
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,753
Yes.

86
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,549
Chairman Cha Gangcheon...

87
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,928
Giving such a fine gift
yet asking for something so modest.

88
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,640
Huh? So modest!

89
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,069
Please stand up for a moment.

90
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,698
Oh.

91
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,700
It's nothing serious.

92
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,704
Just for my peace of mind.

93
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,792
You could be secretly recording
our conversation.

94
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,919
No need for something awful
like a full-body search.

95
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,339
It's just a little pat-down, okay?

96
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
What the heck?

97
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,385
Gosh, Director Seo.

98
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,889
This guy has never
lost a fight in his life.

99
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,643
You should've listened.

100
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,271
Let go.

101
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,696
Uncle! It's a camera!

102
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,246
I told you this would happen, didn't I?

103
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,959
Hey!

104
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,920
You're no better than a thug.

105
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,381
The mighty Daesan Group...

106
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,758
What the hell is this? Aren't you ashamed?

107
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,009
I sincerely apologize.

108
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,929
Unbelievable!

109
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,519
I'm letting it slide

110
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,647
for Chairman Cha Gangcheon's sake.

111
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,445
We're done here.

112
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,115
Just get lost already. Gosh, my head...

113
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,712
This one needs to be
discussed privately.

114
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,930
NAM SANGCHEOL
$720,000

115
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,646
"I, Nam Sangcheol,
accepted dirty money from Daesan"?

116
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,357
You actually want me
to put my signature on this?

117
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,695
Sir, my hidden camera was discovered.

118
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,240
I need your written acknowledgment
at least

119
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,035
to wrap this up, don't you think?

120
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,288
Not a chance.

121
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,541
Either you leave the money and walk away

122
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,210
or take it back.

123
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,297
I've already given you the money.
I'm not taking it back.

124
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,882
Then...

125
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,926
Just leave it here.

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,763
What the heck?

127
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,188
You bastard!

128
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,607
Hitting an assemblyman?

129
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,484
You little...

130
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,200
Just do as I say,

131
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,243
and you won't take another hit.

132
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,537
You punk, just wait there.

133
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,664
I'm calling the police.

134
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,467
Why do you have Tiger's bell?

135
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,009
Plan B.

136
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,804
The camera that got busted earlier
was Plan A.

137
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,682
Plan B is hidden inside this cat bell.

138
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,560
It's another camera, sir.

139
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,196
Isn't this American?

140
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,741
Wait, hold on.

141
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,037
Please stand up for a moment.

142
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,920
At the hearing,

143
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:16,426
{\an8}it would seem most natural if you started
by grilling Mr. Huh Ildo first.

144
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,316
It's 39 trillion.

145
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,319
This project,
involving so much taxpayer money,

146
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,696
was repeatedly criticized by me

147
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,449
for lacking cross-validity checks.

148
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,702
In response, the Ministry
of Trade, Industry, and Energy

149
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,164
{\an8}hired Peterson Consulting
to assess the project.

150
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,749
{\an8}Peterson Consulting found that

151
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,793
trying to obtain oil drilling rights
from the Osar tribe,

152
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,338
a group not even recognized as a nation,

153
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,925
was an extremely reckless plan.

154
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,136
We need to find out
who buried this consulting report

155
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,262
during the process...

156
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,848
Honorable Assemblywoman Seok,

157
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,517
shouldn't you have shared
the Peterson Consulting report

158
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,021
with your colleagues
in the Assembly beforehand?

159
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:14,524
We're all doing this hearing together.

160
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,860
This isn't your solo stage.

161
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,656
I'll take that as a compliment
for being well-prepared.

162
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,284
But just to be clear,
this hearing isn't for my personal gain...

163
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,744
Keep that in mind, right?

164
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,290
Do you need to brag
about information only you have?

165
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,584
Isn't it more important
to thoroughly uncover

166
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,795
the flaws in this energy project?

167
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,338
You're going off-topic.

168
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,340
Stay focused. We're out of time.

169
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,301
I am talking about the core issue! Sir!

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,012
What are you on about?
Don't you know what it means?

171
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,639
Why act clueless now?

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,599
- Clueless? How dare you!
- What?

173
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,477
The public is watching!

174
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,604
This hearing
is being filmed right now!

175
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,982
- The press is here!
- Please adjourn!

176
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:59,237
Assemblyman Kwak!
Are you trying to sabotage the hearing?

177
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,429
{\an8}OVERSEAS RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT HEARING

178
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,903
You did well.

179
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,239
The hearing ends today.

180
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,033
We held the hearing as a formality

181
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,119
and let the assemblymen save face.

182
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,209
We just need to send the materials
to the assemblymen later.

183
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,337
Now, they should let go
of the energy issue

184
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,923
and focus on people's livelihoods.

185
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,553
By the way,

186
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,058
how did you handle
that Seoul slicker Nam Sangcheol?

187
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,311
<i>I put a bell
around the cat's neck.</i>

188
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,939
Is Nam Sangcheol the cat?

189
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,694
What could be the bell
you placed around his neck?

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,571
Hmm?

191
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm getting curious.

192
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,824
It's nothing special, sir.

193
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,165
Mr. Huh is coming out now. Yes, sir.

194
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,794
Thank you for your hard work.

195
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,130
Did you meet Assemblyman Nam Sangcheol
before coming here?

196
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,549
Yes.

197
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:38,688
Buried Hearts

198
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,827
Why are you out here?

199
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,017
Father wants you to have
a glass of champagne

200
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,519
since you worked hard today.

201
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,698
I didn't do much.

202
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,705
It was all thanks to Director Seo.

203
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,143
On good days, the chairman enjoys a longer

204
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,230
- soak in the bath.
- Soak in the bath.

205
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,648
Drink up.

206
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,318
The yolks are especially rich this time.

207
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,654
Yes, Secretary Gong.

208
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,933
You're here, Chairman.

209
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,189
After the hearing adjourned,
I got a call from Mr. Yeom.

210
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,527
He says there won't be any more hearings.

211
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,961
Has he been drinking

212
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,755
that soju from the safe all this time?

213
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,675
Yes.

214
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,347
So, the chairman shares
his safe combination with you.

215
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,558
I'm sure you know

216
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,935
he's not supposed to drink.

217
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,774
Have a seat.

218
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,013
Why didn't you tell me

219
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,225
the hearing ended today?

220
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,937
The chairman should be the first to know.

221
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,523
So I kept it from you.

222
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,619
{\an8}A FEW DAYS AGO

223
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,379
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY TO SUMMON DAESAN ENERGY
OVER ENERGY SCANDAL

224
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,563
That's why your father

225
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,940
called Seo Dongju here.

226
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,151
I'll check with Secretary Gong.

227
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,360
Let's wait.

228
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,739
You'll be the one sitting at the hearing.

229
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,116
Calling Director Seo first
doesn't seem right.

230
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,452
I'll get a call soon.

231
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,164
I still have a workout to finish.

232
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,857
Secretary Gong, is Father done bathing?

233
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,985
Is Director Seo there?

234
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,382
I'll stick with this.

235
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,976
With a drink like this, who needs ginseng?

236
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,604
Well done at the hearing today.

237
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,287
There won't be another hearing, Father.

238
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,331
Yeom Jangseon said that?

239
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes.

240
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,710
If he says so, it must be true.

241
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,128
We've done our part.

242
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,257
Daesan has fulfilled its obligations.

243
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,386
Now it's your turn
to stand firm and stay confident.

244
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,011
Understood?

245
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,429
Yes.

246
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,182
Now, let's hear the fun story

247
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,271
of how Director Seo won over
Assemblyman Nam Sangcheol.

248
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,196
I'd rather not tell you.

249
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,365
Keeping trade secrets?

250
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,123
He's really something else, isn't he?

251
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,543
Put them away.

252
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,173
I thought you were Secretary Gong.

253
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,635
She already nagged me about it,

254
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,888
saying you shouldn't be drinking.

255
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,766
Pour me a glass, Father.

256
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
Director Seo.

257
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,945
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,073
If you're done, give us some space.

259
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,868
We need to talk as a family.

260
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,290
Father, Mr. Yeom made me
an urgent proposal.

261
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,293
Yeom Jangseon talked to you directly?

262
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,971
Why are you out here?

263
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,099
Chrysanthemum tea?

264
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,352
It's okay.
I'll have it inside, Secretary Gong.

265
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,562
Okay.

266
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,789
Is he asking me to come in?

267
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,505
<i>He said
to clock out for the day.</i>

268
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,020
It's a relief.

269
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,941
I was worried the chairman
might face the hearing too.

270
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,901
It must've been tough, right?

271
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,112
Not at all, just the usual.

272
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,572
Hello, Chief Choi
and Director Seo.

273
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,824
What brings you here?

274
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,869
I was escorting President Huh down,
but we had to turn back.

275
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,373
- Why?
- The chairman called for him.

276
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,376
What's going on?

277
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,463
Ms. Yeo Eunnam!

278
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,635
This is Ms. Yeo
from Daesan Energy Seoul HQ.

279
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,262
You've met before, right?

280
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,471
Of course.

281
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,934
I gave her top marks
in the experienced hire interviews.

282
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,686
Oh.

283
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,064
This is Director Seo,
from the Chairman's Office.

284
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,149
Nice to meet you.

285
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,484
Nice to meet you too.

286
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,318
That reminds me.

287
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,987
Ms. Yeo, back when you started,

288
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,489
you botched
the Daesan Energy import report

289
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,784
and got chewed out by the chairman, right?

290
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,579
It was Director Seo who caught that error.

291
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,123
No one else noticed it.

292
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,043
Anyway, what brings you here?

293
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,794
Are you in trouble again?

294
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,881
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, sir.

295
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm right here.

296
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,218
Yes.

297
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,263
Wait inside. I'll bring tea.

298
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,640
- Okay.
- See you.

299
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,873
First time seeing me here, right?

300
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,587
Sit, Director Seo.

301
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,547
Yes.

302
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,141
Aren't you dying to know?

303
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,186
Why I'm sitting here right now.

304
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,688
I'm here for good reasons.

305
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,234
Actually, it benefits all of us, right?

306
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,779
Yes, definitely a good thing
for everyone, sir.

307
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,739
Thank you,
Prosecutor General Yeom,

308
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,865
for suggesting it first.

309
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,200
Gosh.

310
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:03,121
Chairman, it's been forever
since I left the prosecution.

311
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,958
If that title bothers you,
how about "Director Yeom"?

312
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,793
That'll make the NIS staff mad.

313
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,380
I was so harsh on them when I was there.

314
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,510
The best time I ever had
was teaching at my alma mater, Chairman.

315
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,098
So, being called Mr. Yeom
feels simple enough.

316
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:27,104
I just love teaching
and helping others the most, Chairman.

317
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:37,572
Since Director Seo is here,
shall we get into the specifics?

318
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,449
- Is this the report?
- Yes.

319
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,661
Let's have a look.

320
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,162
Director Seo.

321
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,999
Yes, sir.

322
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,959
We can't discuss this matter here.

323
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,044
Sir.

324
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,486
Forget our talk.

325
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,156
You can curse the country here instead.

326
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,331
I never knew our chairman was so cautious.

327
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,500
Would it be possible for me
to rent this room from time to time?

328
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,380
Have you been checking the transfers
of our money to your Swiss account?

329
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,134
My goodness.

330
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,094
Coming in strong like that.

331
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,682
This room was made
to get straight to business, sir.

332
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,103
You want to skip the small talk
and get to the point.

333
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:58,236
It isn't exactly the amount
I originally planned with you,

334
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,156
but the Swiss fund for patriotism

335
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,033
is being

336
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,827
stacked just fine.

337
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,833
Is that an approval
for the Daesan Chemical merger

338
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,877
with Yuseong Chemical?

339
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,046
Director Seo.

340
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,465
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

341
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,220
I just have to get an answer
from The Elder right now, right?

342
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,183
This room blocks signals.
You have to make a call outside.

343
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,819
Well, I'm not sure about that.

344
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,363
Yes.

345
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,449
Go easy.

346
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,327
<i>Gently.</i>

347
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,457
<i>Daesan has indeed worked hard to raise</i>

348
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,002
<i>the National Patriotism Fund.</i>

349
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,547
Don't put too much trust in Yeom Jangseon.

350
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,758
When you're dealing with him,
keep your guard up.

351
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,969
Got it?

352
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,889
I believe we're in this
together with Yeom Jangseon.

353
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,975
Like a fateful community, Father.

354
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,270
You're so naive.

355
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,230
"Fateful community"?

356
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,608
That's just nonsense the strong use
to manipulate the weak!

357
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,862
If that's not the case,

358
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,031
why did you agree to his proposal?

359
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,283
Because it's business.

360
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,368
Just business.

361
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,131
My goodness, is your hand okay?

362
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,716
The device inside

363
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,428
prevents anyone
from opening it from the outside.

364
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,139
Apologies for the inconvenience.

365
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,517
The Yuseong Chemical merger
has been approved.

366
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,855
I'll meet the person in charge
at Yuseong Chemical's bank.

367
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,317
It wasn't easy
convincing The Elder.

368
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,695
There are other groups
interested in Yuseong Chemical too.

369
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,114
I mean, it's not easy

370
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,283
to be patriotic.

371
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,413
Wow.

372
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,094
Come out.

373
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,227
You never let me in this room.

374
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,187
Do you like it?

375
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,448
I didn't know I could paint this well.

376
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,120
I didn't expect you to do it so fast.

377
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,290
How much do you like it?

378
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,736
Okay, come here.

379
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,491
Let's see.

380
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,245
I sent this month's expenses
to the joint account.

381
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,831
I added my share too.

382
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,125
There we go.

383
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,172
You wore your watch in the shower?

384
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,381
Oh? Guess I did.

385
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,636
Surprisingly, it's highly water-resistant
for a knockoff.

386
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,138
Here.

387
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,435
When we get married,
let's each get a real one.

388
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,605
That's what engagement gifts are, right?

389
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,400
This is more than enough.
They're real gemstones.

390
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,904
Come on.
I'll get you something more expensive.

391
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,490
Maybe a diamond-encrusted one.

392
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,206
Why were you
at the chairman's office earlier?

393
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,501
Huh Ildo needed

394
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:08,754
the detailed data
on Daesan Energy's purchase last month.

395
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,925
The executive director was out,
so I had to pass it along.

396
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,886
- Do you want some salad?
- Hold on.

397
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,932
Yes, sir. Yes.

398
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,560
The chairman's granddaughter?

399
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,063
Yes.

400
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,732
I see.

401
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,777
Okay, I understand.

402
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,079
It looks like she'll arrive
in time for the wedding.

403
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,373
Right.

404
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,375
The chairman instructed
that this be kept secret

405
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,295
from both the group and the media.

406
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,464
Only immediate family will attend.

407
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,508
I'll meet with the duty manager
at Daesan Hotel

408
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,343
and report to you afterward.

409
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,805
What's the need for a report?

410
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,017
All right, thanks for your help.

411
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,022
Don't you ever regret giving up
being the chairman's grandson-in-law?

412
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,193
<i>You aimed to marry the granddaughter
and secure your place at Daesan.</i>

413
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,404
I did say that.

414
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,364
<i>I've never met her,</i>

415
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,202
<i>yet why does it feel like
such a missed opportunity?</i>

416
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,246
<i>You should've been the groom
at this wedding,</i>

417
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,041
<i>not the one organizing it.</i>

418
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,126
<i>Why did you give that up?</i>

419
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,638
It looks so delicious.

420
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,808
The chairman's granddaughter
is having a small, intimate wedding.

421
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,478
They asked me to help prepare.

422
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,563
I didn't ask about the call.

423
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,276
Really? But you look curious,
even from behind.

424
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,280
Was it because of me

425
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,325
that you didn't go to New York

426
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,911
to pursue the chairman's granddaughter?

427
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,621
No, it was my fault.

428
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:09,249
To be exact, it's because I fell for you.

429
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,002
I've told you this before.

430
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,836
Several times.

431
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,422
Why do you keep asking?

432
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,675
I like hearing it.

433
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,722
Every time.

434
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,026
Thank you for making time for me.

435
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,823
My vice-chairman requested this meeting,
so it's my pleasure.

436
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,867
If you could extend the loan term
for Yuseong Chemical,

437
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,162
we're willing to follow other decisions.

438
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,456
Thank you.

439
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,554
He's heading out now.

440
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,407
Hello, ma'am.

441
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,242
What was that?

442
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,619
I was caught off guard.

443
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,747
Who am I?

444
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,375
Cha Gukhui.

445
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,586
CEO of Daesan Chemical.

446
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,672
If you look me up online,
this is what you'll find.

447
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,217
"Daesan Chemical will acquire
Yuseong Chemical.

448
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,302
No doubt."

449
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:47,599
As the CEO,
why am I hearing such good news

450
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,808
from elsewhere?

451
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,937
If the chairman didn't tell you,
there must be a good reason.

452
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,313
Hey, Seo Dongju!

453
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,150
Please leave my office now, ma'am.

454
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,242
I've told you many times, if you help me,

455
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,662
I won't forget it...

456
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,165
But you stay silent.

457
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,876
It's been frustrating and hurtful.

458
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,961
So I raised my voice.

459
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,172
- Sorry.
- Ma'am.

460
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,133
I work for Chairman Cha Gangcheon.

461
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,928
I won't go against the chairman's orders.

462
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,015
Why is a young person like you
so old-fashioned?

463
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,518
How long do you think

464
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,730
my father will remain
as chairman of Daesan?

465
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,363
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

466
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,658
If you want to stay at Daesan,

467
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,827
stand behind me.

468
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,332
I'll pave the way for your future.

469
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,429
I'll...

470
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,223
think about it.

471
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,194
Why am I begging a nobody like him

472
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,739
when I don't even know where he came from?

473
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,119
He's a fox who has my father
wrapped around his finger.

474
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,338
Sit.

475
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,762
- Did you bring it?
- Yes, sir.

476
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,310
No, give it to me.

477
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:00,732
The flavor of a lollipop starts
when you unwrap it.

478
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,111
Was Gukhui throwing a fit?

479
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,866
I'm here to avoid her.
She always ends up crying and begging.

480
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,536
If Daesan Chemical acquires
Yuseong Chemical,

481
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,290
it'll get too big for Gukhui to manage.

482
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,836
She won't be able to expand
the chemical sector.

483
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:23,713
Right?

484
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,216
What?

485
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,677
Do you want the lollipop?

486
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,597
No, sir.

487
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,390
Let's see...

488
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,810
Daesan lacked a vice-chairman for a while.

489
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,104
How long has it been
since I became chairman?

490
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,107
It's been 29 years.

491
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,859
Hmm.

492
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,572
I should promote Huh Ildo
to vice-chairman.

493
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,869
I need to see if Huh Ildo has
what it takes to be chairman on his own,

494
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,747
not just as part of the Cha family.

495
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,832
He's a son-in-law
and not of the bloodline.

496
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,753
But a son-in-law still holds more weight
than a total outsider.

497
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,221
Gather feedback on Huh Ildo
from the subsidiaries.

498
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,807
Yes, sir.

499
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,443
Yes. Pardon?

500
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,196
Yes, sir.

501
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,492
There he is.

502
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,713
I received urgent orders
from the chairman.

503
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,048
I need to board with you.

504
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,717
What orders?

505
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,221
So, you're getting on my helicopter,

506
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:59,057
flying to Daesan Energy where I'm the CEO,

507
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,893
and you can't tell me why?

508
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,148
The chairman

509
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,401
wants to promote you
to the group's vice-chairman.

510
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,864
I was told to meet with executives
over the next 10 days.

511
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,700
Does he want a temperature check?

512
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,410
Yes.

513
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,579
Congratulations, sir.

514
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,332
Sorry I made an inspector
spill his mission.

515
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,209
Use this helicopter for 10 days.

516
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,670
Save some travel time.

517
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,630
Thank you, sir.

518
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,216
Eunnam?

519
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,765
Whoa.

520
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,891
Why are you here?

521
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,728
If not now,
I'd have to wait until we get home.

522
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,398
I love this.

523
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,483
What?

524
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,821
That you couldn't wait
and came all the way up to the helipad.

525
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,725
Hold on.

526
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,477
Yes, sir.

527
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,313
<i>Hey, Seo Dongju.
How could you do this?</i>

528
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,066
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- See you. Sorry.

529
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,776
I'm on my way.

530
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,020
The chairman shouldn't handle it this way.

531
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:55,192
If he wants an evaluation on Huh Ildo,
he should give the order to me first.

532
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,737
Then I'd pass it to you.
That's the right way.

533
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,658
The chairman once said he'd hand
the chairman position to a professional

534
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,120
if his son-in-law and daughter
weren't fit for it.

535
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:11,082
But in the end,
even if he's not related by blood,

536
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,960
a son-in-law is still closer.

537
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,423
Chief...

538
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,176
Yuseong Chemical is being acquired.

539
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,302
What?

540
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,595
The chairman believes

541
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,725
Daesan Chemical's expansion
will be too much for Cha Gukhui to handle.

542
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,606
If Cha Gukhui steps down,
recommend me for the role.

543
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,275
If Huh Ildo becomes vice-chairman,

544
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,613
I'll recommend you for
the president position of Daesan Energy.

545
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,033
We need to leave the back office

546
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,912
and build real experience
on the front lines.

547
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:49,996
Director Seo...

548
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:54,334
You told me this when I first joined
Daesan's secretary office.

549
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,671
"Without a son,

550
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,216
the chairman's empire
is an open battlefield,

551
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,843
and you should dream big."

552
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,851
I've followed that advice ever since.

553
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,674
"Yeo Eunnam."

554
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,137
If we break up and you meet someone else,

555
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,556
what'll you do with this tattoo?

556
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,566
If you fall for someone else,
you'll need to get rid of it.

557
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,318
That's going to hurt.

558
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,450
I'll handle it myself. Got it?

559
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,081
So you're not saying you won't?

560
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,542
I'd have to get revenge.

561
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,295
- Revenge?
- Yes.

562
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,923
I'd show up holding another woman's hand

563
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,052
to make you regret leaving me.

564
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,981
My heart's ripping apart.

565
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,445
Just imagining you
being with another woman

566
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,114
makes my gut ache.

567
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,288
Like I'd die...

568
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,459
Actually, I'd rather die.

569
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,587
Eunnam.

570
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,468
Dongju,

571
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,223
you're not the kind of person
who'd leave me.

572
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,645
If we ever break up,
it'll be because I walk away.

573
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,401
But just the thought
of another woman next to you...

574
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,986
Must you take revenge?

575
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
Gosh.

576
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,616
Are you crying?

577
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,496
Eunnam, if it's not you,
I'm not getting married.

578
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,333
I'll stay single forever.

579
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,318
Was it too much?

580
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,031
Yeah, the candles...

581
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,326
and the wine.

582
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,789
- What do we do?
- What else? We have to clean it up.

583
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,541
Let's do it later.

584
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,338
What do we do?

585
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,977
Wow.

586
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,478
What's this?

587
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,606
You love it when I dry your hair.

588
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,492
What's going on

589
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:57,703
with all this VIP treatment?

590
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:01,332
Eunnam, you're acting suspicious.

591
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,084
You don't like it?

592
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,315
This feels nice.

593
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,615
That's mine.

594
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,706
- This might take a while.
- Okay.

595
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,009
Okay.

596
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,368
Yes.

597
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,037
Yes.

598
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,915
Okay, I got it.
I'm not backing down anymore!

599
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,588
Tell them to keep their promise.

600
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,273
Dongju!

601
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,483
Dongju! Dongju, what's wrong?

602
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,777
Dongju!

603
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,322
Dongju!

604
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,577
Dongju!

605
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,087
Dongju.

606
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:15,924
Dongju.

607
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:22,973
Found it.

608
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,353
She uses her English name, Jennifer Huh.

609
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,688
I'll send it to you.

610
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,576
Have a look.

611
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,622
Director Seo!

612
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:48,957
- Check it.
- Okay.

613
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,211
The New York address
of the chairman's granddaughter.

614
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:56,714
So I show up and say I'm there
to deliver persimmons from Seoul?

615
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,133
The chairman's granddaughter
won't eat any others

616
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,637
after trying
my sister-in-law's persimmons.

617
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:06,557
Director Cha requested this last time,
so I sent some with staff to New York.

618
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,311
This time, you'll take the persimmons
on your business trip

619
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,106
and show up in front of Jennifer.

620
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,149
She'll love it.

621
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,237
Even better
if you bring Jennifer back with you.

622
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,080
So embarrassing.

623
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,591
Yes, sir.

624
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,135
Yes, I'm with him.

625
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,387
I understand.

626
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,703
Jeez!

627
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,712
Is this your car?

628
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,633
Yes.

629
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,760
Then...

630
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,221
you must be Director Seo Dongju.

631
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,599
Yes, that's me.

632
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,269
I'm Yeo Eunnam
from Daesan Energy's Seoul HQ.

633
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,857
I wrote the recent import data report
for Daesan Energy.

634
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,318
Yes, Yeo Eunnam...

635
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,945
I remember seeing your name.

636
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:28,449
Next time you find an error,
give me a chance to fix it first.

637
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,119
Thanks to you
ratting me out to the higher-ups,

638
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,706
I got called in
and scolded by the chairman himself.

639
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,544
So, I snitched,

640
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,548
and that's why the chairman...

641
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,468
My bad.

642
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,888
Next time, I'll do as you say.

643
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:52,599
Okay.

644
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,310
Yes.

645
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:02,859
Looks like you've waited a while.
Want to grab a bite with me?

646
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,740
Looks like you're still mad.

647
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,661
How about some good food
and you take it out on me there?

648
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,372
Once you've let it all out,

649
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:21,086
I'll teach you a formula
to catch errors instantly in reports.

650
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,389
Do you always pack lunch for work?

651
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,934
They're persimmons
that need to get to New York.

652
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,104
Earlier,

653
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,357
I saw you yelling in the lobby.

654
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,861
I wasn't yelling,
just mouthing the words.

655
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:47,946
Mmm.

656
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,449
Looked like you were cursing.

657
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,162
Seo Dongju.

658
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,873
- You bastard.
- Bastard.

659
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,056
<i>Chief Choi.</i>

660
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,059
<i>I'm not taking the persimmons to New York.</i>

661
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:18,894
<i>Why not?</i>

662
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,104
<i>Why give up without even trying?</i>

663
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,649
<i>I'm not giving up.</i>

664
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:25,942
<i>I've made my choice.</i>

665
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,514
<i>Dongju.</i>

666
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,641
Dongju.

667
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,436
Dongju!

668
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,697
Are you okay?

669
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,909
Eunnam.

670
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,872
I'm okay now.

671
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,878
Sorry, I didn't realize
the bread had cinnamon when I bought it.

672
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,173
I was going to freeze it for later...

673
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,388
A second later and it would've been bad.

674
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,641
You jumped in with CPR.

675
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,685
You saved my life.

676
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,854
I'm sorry.

677
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,481
Of all days, it happened today.

678
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,568
Of all days?

679
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,739
A day...

680
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,576
I wanted to make special for you.

681
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,081
- What?
- Just...

682
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,375
I'm just excited.

683
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,044
You're already great
to the guy you live with.

684
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,382
Just imagine how good you'll be
to your future husband.

685
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,551
I don't know who it'll be,

686
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,556
but I'm already so jealous
of that lucky guy.

687
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,057
Let's just do it.

688
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,684
Without it?

689
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,812
Yes.

690
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,043
SECRETARY GONG

691
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,063
Yes, Secretary Gong.

692
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,651
Uh...

693
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,404
I heard the wedding is just for family.

694
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:02,325
The chairman says
he wants you to escort him.

695
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,703
Yes.

696
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:06,705
At Daesan Hotel.

697
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,421
Chairman's calling for me.

698
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,346
Eunnam.

699
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,099
Eunnam.

700
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,607
Eunnam.

701
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,568
Eunnam.

702
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,456
<i>I'm heading out.
Take it easy on your jog.</i>

703
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,335
<i>Let's have dinner together tonight.
I'll make a reservation.</i>

704
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,507
{\an8}SCHEDULE SEND

705
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:09,995
Hmm.

706
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:11,829
I like it.

707
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,206
Simple and elegant.

708
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,543
We kept it
as minimal as you requested.

709
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,380
It wouldn't feel right not to have it,
so it's just a small family wedding.

710
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,757
No need for any fuss.

711
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:27,803
General Manager, forget about this
and focus on running the hotel.

712
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,972
Yes, Chairman. If you need anything...

713
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,474
I'll reach out.

714
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,102
I'll leave everything to you, then.

715
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,318
I'll take a nap for a bit.

716
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:56,958
It's you.

717
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,668
Seo Dongju.

718
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,921
This isn't where you belong.

719
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,630
Why are you here?

720
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,924
Here to stuff your face?

721
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,426
Eat up and get lost.

722
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,014
Didn't you hear? I'm a prosecutor.

723
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,266
Still as childish as ever.

724
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,855
And you're still a pathetic thug.

725
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,815
Oh, right.

726
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,068
Hearing a bastard like you
became a prosecutor

727
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,695
made me worry about this country.

728
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,907
You? Worried about the country?

729
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,325
Right?

730
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:34,370
I've never once worried
about this country before,

731
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,831
but the moment you became a prosecutor,

732
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,750
I suddenly did.

733
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,044
Funny, isn't it?

734
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,341
Aren't you a director at Daesan?

735
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,260
I can't wrap my head around it.

736
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:52,472
A thug like you making it that far.

737
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,517
You'll be seeing a lot more surprises.

738
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,812
Like me becoming the president.

739
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,147
You bastard.

740
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,567
Is it that shocking?

741
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,614
Oh, I'm sorry.

742
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,452
- You're insane.
- Wait, hold on.

743
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:19,833
Today, I'm becoming
your chairman's grandson-in-law.

744
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:26,880
If Prosecutor Yeom Huicheol
joins the Daesan family,

745
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:30,718
it'll be tough for a thug like you
to become president, don't you think?

746
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,720
Just common sense.

747
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:37,724
So, Mr. Yeom Jangseon...

748
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:38,810
Yes.

749
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,773
Yeah, your precious mentor, Yeom Jangseon,

750
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,695
my uncle, is the one who arranged this.

751
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,281
Do yourself a favor

752
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,741
and resign before it's too late.

753
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,785
Or you'll be cut.

754
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,120
Your breath stinks. Step back.

755
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,333
Sure. I'm sorry about that.

756
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,171
Hey, Dongju.

757
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:10,216
You know you want my favor.

758
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:11,801
So just beg for it.

759
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,012
Humiliation won't kill you.

760
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,225
And stop cursing, or I'll make you pay.

761
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,811
Still think you're in high school?

762
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,524
You're as pathetic as ever.

763
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,609
Damn.

764
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,777
I'll keep cursing you out.
Deal with it.

765
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,363
And that was my last punch.

766
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,742
We're even for what you did

767
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,870
in high school.

768
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,421
That damn thug.

769
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,016
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

770
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,518
- Congrats.
- Yes.

771
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,867
We will now begin
the wedding ceremony

772
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,497
of Groom Yeom Huicheol
and Bride Jennifer Huh.

773
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,041
The groom will enter.

774
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:30,879
Please give him
a big round of applause and cheers!

775
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,049
Groom, enter!

776
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,611
Now, the true star of today's ceremony.

777
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,823
The beautiful bride
will make her entrance.

778
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,618
Everyone, she's stepping in now.

779
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,080
Let's greet her
with a big round of applause.

780
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,920
Bride, enter.

781
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,052
Let go.

782
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,888
Let go of me!

783
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:29,307
Buried Hearts

784
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:33,855
{\an8}<i>Make sure you get your revenge
and walk in holding another woman's hand.</i>

785
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,023
{\an8}<i>Seo Dongju...</i>

786
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,318
{\an8}<i>Are you sure he's not just
after a place in the Daesan family?</i>

787
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,821
{\an8}<i>I'm the one
who gave everything to Daesan.</i>

788
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,199
{\an8}<i>No matter what, Seo Dongju has to go.</i>

789
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,952
{\an8}Kick Seo Dongju out of Daesan.

790
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,497
{\an8}<i>I'm not leaving Daesan.</i>

791
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,623
{\an8}<i>This all happened</i>

792
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:57,587
{\an8}<i>because you chose the woman I lived with
to be your niece-in-law, sir.</i>
