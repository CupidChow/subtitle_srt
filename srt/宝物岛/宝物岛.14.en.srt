President Huh.

00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,584
President Huh.

7
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,857
President Huh, are you with me?

8
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,860
Director Seo…

9
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,697
Are you okay?

10
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,702
Hold on, let me call 911…

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,334
Director Seo…

12
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,670
Do you believe in the afterlife?

13
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,677
Starting now,

14
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,847
I'll believe in it.

15
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,768
What are you talking about?
We don't have time…

16
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,358
In my afterlife…

17
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,944
Sunho,

18
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,489
Gyeongwon,

19
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,621
and my son, Dongju…

20
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,876
I'll beg them for forgiveness every day.

21
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,464
Take care of Taeyun…

22
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,383
President Huh.

23
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,219
I don't believe in the afterlife.

24
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,931
What good is it to plead
as a ghost when you're dead?

25
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,225
Beg for forgiveness…

26
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,395
while you're alive and breathing.

27
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,440
I still have unfinished business with you.

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,484
If you die like this,

29
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,570
I'll never forgive you.

30
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,239
Got it?

31
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,494
Just hang in there.

32
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,921
President Huh, I will…

33
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,216
President Huh.

34
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,654
President Huh.

35
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,453
President Huh.

36
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>At the home

{\an8}Your condolences aren't welcome here.

47
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,407
Why can't I pay
my respects to my dear friend?

48
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,786
Because you sent a hitman
to kill that dear friend.

49
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,624
How does it feel seeing me alive?

50
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,002
Annoying as hell.

51
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,005
Thank you for
that DNA test on me and President Huh.

52
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,094
In case I died without knowing that
I was getting killed by my own father,

53
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,013
you thoughtfully sent me
a DNA test letter.

54
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,476
But look at me, still here,
face-to-face with you.

55
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,230
I haven't finished what I need to do yet.

56
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,984
Guess heaven keeps
giving me chances so I can finish it.

57
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,862
Talk all you want.

58
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,781
I should go see
my dear friend off one last time.

59
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,452
Who are these people?

60
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,831
Leave before
we chase you out, Chief Cheon.

61
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,770
<i>The memorial for President Huh</i>

62
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,856
<i>has been set up
at Daesan Hospital's funeral hall.</i>

63
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,609

64
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,194

THE LATE HUH ILDO

67
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,321
<i>Director Seo is Ildo's son?</i>

68
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,700
Is there any proof of this, Deokhui?

69
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,245
I saw their DNA test results
with my own eyes.

70
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,538
So that's why

71
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,708
you tried to push Ildo out
of Daesan Energy.

72
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:43,046
Seo Dongju's going to come for
your brother-in-law's inheritance.

73
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,841
Ildo owned a significant share
of Daesan Energy stock.

74
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,386
After Father, you have the most,

75
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,179
then my brother-in-law.

76
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,597
He had over three times my shares.

77
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,727
Every time Daesan Energy grew,
Father told him to increase his stake.

78
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,146
He backed him a lot, Deokhui.

79
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,441
And I supported it too.

80
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,861
It was all meant for Taeyun anyway.

81
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,406
But…

82
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,491
Ms. Cha.

83
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,411
The chairman
of Cha Daebok Cultural Foundation is here.

84
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,758
That means…

85
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,679
Taeyun and Director Seo are brothers.

86
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,058
Seo Dongju always bothered me.

87
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,644
Now he's become a major obstacle.

88
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,858
What do we do, honey?

89
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,740
Drink up.

90
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,794
You love this drink.

91
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,342
Don't grieve too much
over President Huh's death.

92
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,887
Life and death are in fate's hands.

93
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,139
There's nothing we can do.

94
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,224
Is that so?

95
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,562
Now that your son-in-law's gone,

96
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,023
what's the plan

97
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,068
for the Daesan Energy CEO seat?

98
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,112
It's a position Gukhui has always wanted…

99
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,172
I'm back alive, Chairman.

100
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,389
Director Seo, have a seat.

101
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,817
The chairman told me.

102
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,237
So, President Huh Ildo
was your biological father?

103
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,035
Sadly, you had to say goodbye to him
as soon as you found out.

104
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,626
The chairman's getting old.

105
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,003
He won't be able
to stay long at the funeral.

106
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,798
- I'll bring him there for a bit tonight...
- Ms. Ji.

107
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,717
Could you step out?

108
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,345
I need to talk to the chairman.

109
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,058
What's there to hide from me...

110
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,143
Yeongsu.

111
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,812
Step out for a moment.

112
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,613
And Ms. Ji.

113
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,869
Thanks to me,
you became the lady of the Daesan family.

114
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,496
It'd be a shame if you forgot that…

115
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,041
and kept stirring up trouble.

116
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,208
You plotted to kill me and President Huh
with Mr. Yeom.

117
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,460
You only had half success.

118
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,046
Since only President Huh is gone.

119
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,468
I sent Mr. Yeom away
when he came to pay his respects.

120
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,931
So, Chairman,
don't think about coming to the funeral.

121
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,478
I told the police that I'd never seen

122
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,272
the hitman Mr. Yeom sent.

123
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,071
I'll cover up

124
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,657
this massive stain on your name.

125
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,952
You need to stop coming after me too.

126
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,039
If you put me in danger,

127
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,585
Cha Seonu might not have
a place in Daesan anymore, Chairman.

128
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,062
<i>Why do you think they kept
their father-son relationship a secret?</i>

129
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,525
What if he's keeping Director Seo
close to Cha Seonu…

130
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,988
to take Cha Seonu down eventually?

131
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,161
You bastard!

132
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,206
How dare you
threaten me like that!

133
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,334
HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY EXAM

134
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,103
Hey, Dongju.

135
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,279
Sir, I have something to tell you.

136
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,198
Yes, Seonu. What is it?

137
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,036
Dongju, I can't do it.

138
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,705
You said you wanted to tell him yourself.

139
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,128
Seonu…

140
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,381
wants to tell you
his plans for the future.

141
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,008
Guess it's hard for him to say alone.

142
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,176
Hurry.

143
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,850
Sir.

144
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,936
You said you wanted to know
what my plans were.

145
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,648
First, I'm going to take
the college entrance exam.

146
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,902
I'll only ride the bike
when I ride with Dongju.

147
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:21,986
And…

148
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,447
Is it a business major?

149
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,409
Yes, I'm planning to major in business.

150
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,329
<i>College?</i>

151
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,291
Studying isn't my thing…

152
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,880
Can't you just give me
a position at Daesan?

153
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,757
I'll work really hard.

154
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,345
And riding my bike
is like wearing shoes for me.

155
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,806
Do you want me to go around barefoot?

156
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,897
Dongju.

157
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,400
Guess he doesn't like the plan.
He's quiet.

158
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,821
Seonu, you needed time
to adjust to your new environment,

159
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,531
so I've been holding back.

160
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,992
But you should start calling him
"Father" instead of "Sir."

161
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,162
I called him "sir" from the start.

162
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,081
- It feels awkward and difficult.
- I know.

163
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,166
That's exactly why you should.

164
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,461
You can't go through life
only doing what's easy.

165
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,090
The more you avoid things,
the harder they get, Seonu.

166
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,468
Okay.

167
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,598
Sir… I mean…

168
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,184
Father!

169
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,228
Yes.

170
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,523
That's right, Seonu.

171
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,153
From now on, I'll call you Father.

172
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,612
Right.

173
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,593
Eunnam.

174
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,012
I heard you were here, so I waited.

175
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,514
To go to President Huh's funeral together.

176
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,020
I wasn't going to go,
but if I think about Taeyun, I should.

177
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,984
Go be with Taeyun, I'll go later.

178
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,320
Why?

179
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,533
No way.

180
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,830
When did you find out?

181
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,083
The night of the chairman's wedding.

182
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,923
Then he passed not long after
you found out he was your father.

183
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,592
Within two weeks.

184
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,266
Dongju.

185
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,853
I wanted to…

186
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,233
spend your last moments with you
when you were in the hospital.

187
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,568
That's why I divorced him.

188
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,618
For me, Dongju,
you always come before anyone else.

189
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,376
Huh Ildo ruined my childhood

190
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,965
and left me with trauma I'd carry forever,
and you'd hate him with me…

191
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,469
The only person on my side is you, Dongju.

192
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,350
But now I find out you're his son?

193
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,561
That's just cruel.

194
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,692
You should've just kept it from me.

195
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:53,197
I know better than anyone
how much you've suffered

196
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,284
over your father's unjust death.

197
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,912
But keeping the truth from you…

198
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,749
felt like I was lying to you.

199
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,463
I knew I had to tell you.

200
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,218
But I was worried that you'd leave me

201
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,596
after learning I was his son.

202
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,557
Then I thought,

203
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,686
"If you do,

204
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,732
should I beg for forgiveness every day
in President Huh's place?

205
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,404
Or should I just cling to you,
telling you I can't live without you

206
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,157
and ask for your understanding?"

207
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,868
But that felt wrong.

208
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,996
If I truly understood your pain,

209
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,041
how could I say that?

210
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,045
Lately, this is what I've become.

211
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:54,800
Eunnam.

212
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,055
You and me…

213
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,517
caught in a net

214
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,688
woven by our parents and all those adults…

215
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,944
Do you think we can ever
break free from it without getting hurt?

216
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,208
<i>Want another bottle of soju?</i>

217
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,682
"By dragging Ji Seonu in,

218
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,311
Dongju's going to ruin Taeyun's future.
I must kill him."

219
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,606
The thought led me to shoot you.

220
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,317
I'm aware of that.

221
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,905
Pushing Sunho, Gyeongwon,
and her child into the water…

222
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,532
If that unforgivable act…

223
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,119
wasn't going to end up meaningless,

224
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,955
I had no choice but to kill you.

225
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,460
Because you were standing
at the end of the road I'd run down.

226
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,629
All I wanted…

227
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,633
was to impress the chairman

228
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,261
and climb the ladder at Daesan.

229
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,182
All I had was such a simple ambition.

230
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,728
But thanks to you and Mr. Yeom,

231
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,189
I've changed this much.

232
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,526
In the sea,

233
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,947
when you saved me even after I shot you…

234
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,199
Is that when it started?

235
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,124
I wanted a proper revenge.

236
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,755
Whatever you and Mr. Yeom
tried to take after killing me,

237
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,717
I was determined…

238
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,970
to crush all of it.

239
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,520
You really do take after me.

240
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,605
Even the greedy part.

241
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,277
But I never crossed the line.

242
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,863
I didn't kill people around me

243
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,533
just to get what I wanted.

244
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,834
If I could ever make up for it…

245
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:15,918
After all that?

246
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,588
To pay for it,
I'd have to give up my life.

247
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,301
But I don't want to die,
so I guess that's not possible.

248
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,225
When I die of old age someday,

249
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,815
scatter my ashes over the sea
right where you saved me.

250
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,279
Right where I pulled the trigger
and tried to kill you,

251
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,116
you saved me.

252
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,160
When I die,

253
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,539
I want to repent there.

254
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,970
You're not dying anytime soon.

255
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,848
Who knows? I might go first.

256
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,270
I'm planning to live a long time.

257
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,774
A very long time.

258
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,239
Of course you would.

259
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,704
If I want to wait
for the day you call me Father,

260
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,583
I'll have to live very long.

261
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,820
Don't think saving me once
makes everything right.

262
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,532
You're nowhere near making up for it.

263
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,912
How could you just die like that?

264
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,623
<i>"Father,</i>

265
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,626
take good care of your health."

266
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,629
"Son,

267
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,632
don't skip your meals."

268
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,678
Do you think there will come a day…

269
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,474
when we make small talks like that?

270
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,418
Just for now, all right?

271
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,711
Just for a little while.

272
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,357
This is ridiculous!

273
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,194
He took Ildo's ashes to his own place.

274
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,029
How did no one stop him?

275
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,947
Taeyun!

276
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,076
You couldn't even keep
your own father's ashes?

277
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,161
I told Dongju to do as he wished.

278
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,830
After all, he's my father's son too.

279
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,209
So Dongju and Taeyun are brothers?

280
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,629
Director Seo was so adamant.

281
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,132
To stop him,
we would've had to fight him over the urn.

282
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,759
We can't stoop to that, Father.

283
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,431
How about you, Eunnam?

284
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,810
Stepfather or not, he raised you.

285
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,813
Grandfather, do I need to say out loud
who matters more

286
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,690
between a biological son
and a stepdaughter?

287
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,694
Honestly, I think
the bigger problem is you,

288
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,989
who couldn't even speak up
when you were banned from the funeral.

289
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,742
You…

290
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,705
He wasn't banned. We just thought
it might be too much for him at his age.

291
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:09,002
And Seonu and I decided to stay home
since the chairman wasn't going.

292
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,004
Right, honey?

293
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,840
Yes, right.

294
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,593
We'll get going now.

295
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,014
You said you had something
to discuss with Deokhui.

296
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,688
Right…

297
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,982
Everyone else can go.

298
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,608
Deokhui, stay.

299
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,742
You must make sure

300
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,829
Ildo's inheritance doesn't end up
in Director Seo's hands.

301
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,916
It won't be easy.

302
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,710
Why?

303
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,628
You should've seen it for yourself.

304
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,173
Holding the paternity test result,

305
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,344
he stood his ground
and insisted he was taking Ildo's urn.

306
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,766
That's why I'm saying this.

307
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,145
To cut out anyone
who doesn't carry our last name,

308
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,439
you and I need to stick closer than ever.

309
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,152
I've got Seonu, my full-blooded son.

310
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,822
You've got Taeyun,
and he's only half-blooded.

311
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,742
Deokhui.

312
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,579
Seonu's your only brother.
You've got to look out for him.

313
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,456
Father!

314
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,876
Of course, I'm not asking you for free.

315
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,963
You won't be disappointed.

316
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,800
I'll hand over some Daesan Volt shares.

317
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,559
I wonder
how Director Seo's holding up.

318
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,437
He lost his father
as soon as they were reunited.

319
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,442
How did you know about that?

320
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,152
It was on the news today.

321
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,739
They spent years not even knowing
they were father and son…

322
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:01,949
It's heartbreaking.

323
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,118
If they'd only found out sooner.

324
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,958
Now that he's found his dad,

325
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,127
he must be wondering
who his birth mother is too.

326
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,755
Right?

327
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,842
THE ELDER

328
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,807
Sir, I'll call you right back in a moment.

329
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,933
<i>Just listen.</i>

330
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,020
We've just been informed
the person responsible

331
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,899
for Director Seo's accident
has ties to you, Jangseon.

332
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,194
<i>I'm sure it's just a coincidence.</i>

333
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,447
But if we get another
coincidence like this,

334
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,741
I won't stay quiet.

335
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:55,210
He's a really dangerous man,
this Yeom Jangseon.

336
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,713
If I don't make it
to the end of my presidency,

337
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,133
it would be because of Jangseon.

338
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,969
I doubt that'll happen.

339
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,018
- I need water.
- Sure.

340
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,482
Here.

341
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,944
Honey.

342
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,948
I'm thinking of inviting
Director Seo over for a meal.

343
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,952
Last time, it seemed like
he remembered being here as a kid...

344
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,996
No.

345
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,293
I can't go a day
without hearing that name.

346
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,386
Y, 1, 10…

347
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,638
{\an8}LIQUOR SAFE
INNER SAFE

348
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,690
What?

349
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,489
How much do you need, sir?

350
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,830
You bastard.

351
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,208
You…

352
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,501
Give me the code right now!

353
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,211
I'm afraid I can't do that.

354
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,420
What?

355
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,591
You shameless thief!

356
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,718
Do you need some gold too?

357
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,392
Get out here now!

358
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,649
Get out of there.

359
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,154
- Get out!
- Chairman.

360
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,907
Oh, Mr. Yeom. That…

361
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,118
That bastard…

362
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,425
I prepared the usual size
for you, Mr. Yeom.

363
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,970
God, that's heavy.

364
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,683
I'm curious.

365
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,685
Really curious…

366
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,312
What's it like to live with

367
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,648
two trillion won
from the National Patriotism Fund

368
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,151
and Daesan's slush money
stuffed in your damn head?

369
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,074
What's it like?

370
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,243
It feels incredible.

371
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,251
Chairman,
you finally saw for yourself

372
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,712
just how tenacious
and ruthless this guy is.

373
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,882
Most people would run off
after something like this.

374
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,091
Chairman.

375
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,429
After what happened to President Huh,
you know how dangerous Mr. Yeom is.

376
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,849
He turned you into
a murder conspirator overnight.

377
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,768
It's best to cut ties with him
as soon as possible.

378
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,233
I'm sick of this. Just kill me already
and get your revenge, you bastard.

379
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,568
Come on.

380
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,197
I told you before,
your life's not worth killing for.

381
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,367
What the hell are you stalling for?

382
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,244
What do you want?

383
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,246
Nothing much.

384
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,500
Maybe just watching you
crawling at my feet,

385
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,961
begging like your life depends on it?

386
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,588
You crazy bastard…

387
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,050
You're the one who turned me
into such a crazy bastard, sir.

388
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,769
Then, I'll take my leave.

389
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,524
Chairman, we can't let him
be the gatekeeper

390
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,110
every time we need cash from the vault.

391
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,695
We need a plan.

392
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,281
Break the door or blow it open.

393
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,075
Well…

394
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,787
That inner vault is
nearly impossible to break into.

395
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,294
Nice to meet you.

396
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,090
Thank you for agreeing to the interview.

397
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:23,270
I saw the article about you recently
finding out President Huh was your father.

398
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,021
I wanted to do a deeper piece on it.

399
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,024
I also heard you turned down
every other outlet

400
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,734
and only agreed to speak with us.

401
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,862
I did it because it was you,
Journalist Ma Jaeyeol.

402
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,657
Oh… You remember me.

403
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,825
You came by

404
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,869
about the Dandelion files
a while ago, right?

405
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,746
Yes, that's right.

406
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,542
I'm still chasing the story behind them.

407
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,170
Always asking,

408
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,047
"Dandelion, where are you?"

409
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,547
Thank you.

410
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,591
Mr. Yeom will be here soon.

411
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,675
Okay.

412
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,054
Gosh. Is it real gold?

413
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,223
Mmm.

414
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,808
Such a nice aroma.

415
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:00,950
My goodness.

416
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,827
No traffic getting here?

417
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,953
Yes.

418
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,539
We've been a bit distant,
haven't we?

419
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,877
<i>What's gotten into him?
It's not like him.</i>

420
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,135
I've opened a nice bottle of wine early.

421
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,512
Guho.

422
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,097
Open up plenty of wine.

423
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,057
- Yes, sir.
- Go on in.

424
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,189
Jangseon,

425
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,193
isn't this the wine
I raved about right here last time?

426
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,072
Even these anchovies…

427
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,077
taste just like last time.

428
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,955
It's been a while, but you remember.

429
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,792
Jangseon, remembering things well
is the one skill that's kept me going.

430
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,964
I still remember
how you chewed me out to set me straight.

431
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,514
Why bother remembering
something like that?

432
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,517
Guho.

433
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,159
These are made in the US.

434
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,326
Genuine American stuff?

435
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,162
I knew you'd recognize it.

436
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,170
Wow.

437
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,963
Hey, look at this.

438
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,552
Didn't Director Seo
use to hand the shirts out?

439
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,763
That's under my authority now.

440
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,847
What…

441
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,683
Then you and Chairman Cha…

442
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,980
This is all for you, Assemblyman Nam.

443
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,191
What?

444
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,776
Jangseon…

445
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,862
You didn't have to go out
of your way like this.

446
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,908
Hey.

447
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,284
Hey!

448
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,911
He's taking it away…

449
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:08,995
Jangseon.

450
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,791
Didn't you say it was all mine?

451
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,709
I'll keep it and give you later.

452
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,044
When?

453
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,713
Once you get Seo Dongju away
from the Elder.

454
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,382
What?

455
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,995
Thanks for getting me medical treatment.

456
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,123
Yeom Jangseon won't stop coming after you.

457
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,501
I won't fall for it twice.

458
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,964
Stay safe and take care.

459
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,550
I won't forget that…

460
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,010
I owe you my life.

461
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,245
We've found most of the real estate
under Jangseon's name and aliases.

462
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,708
Even if the Administrator helps us,
would there be anything more to dig up?

463
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,918
There could be more.

464
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,087
But will he really help us?

465
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:20,585
God, I just tried to snag that watch,
but I messed with the wrong guy.

466
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:25,006
And I've been paying the price for it
ever since, you know, Dongju?

467
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,896
I've been wanting to ask you this.

468
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,857
Why are you going this far to help me?

469
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,443
Because you got caught stealing my watch?

470
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,236
You're free to misunderstand.

471
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,282
Dongju, do you think
I'm helping you for no reason?

472
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,161
I'm just going after
Yeom Jangseon in my own way.

473
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,829
I can't stand losing to such a guy.

474
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,918
Fighting Yeom Jangseon
isn't just your war anymore.

475
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,921
So that's how it ends up.

476
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,883
I understand.

477
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,388
Then I'll take on
the hospital that framed you,

478
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,223
like it's my own battle.

479
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,350
People will think I made you do it.

480
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,728
The ultimate climax
I want to see from Yeom Jangseon is…

481
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:25,525
the Dandelion.

482
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,361
Really?

483
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,699
A full report
on all of Yeom Jangseon's dirty deeds

484
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,785
spreading everywhere online,
on the news and in the papers,

485
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,870
until he feels the deepest…

486
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,082
shame he could possibly feel.

487
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,836
But Yeom Jangseon's barely even human,

488
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,921
so I'm not sure he's capable of shame.

489
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,467
Maybe he does feel it, at least a little.

490
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:55,471
Why else would he be
so desperate to destroy the wiretaps

491
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,223
that recorded his shame?

492
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,183
Then…

493
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,864
YEOM JANGSEON: YOU NEED TO GREET
PEOPLE IN THE PROSECUTION, MEDIA…

494
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,700
Here, have some tangerines while you work.

495
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:24,208
From what I've read,
Yeom Jangseon really did some nasty stuff.

496
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,003
It would've been easier
to look over at home,

497
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,589
but Dongju's super strict about security.

498
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,923
You can only read it here.

499
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,259
He won't even share it with us.

500
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,969
No copies, no prints,

501
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,972
and as soon as you leave,
we must wipe it clean.

502
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,976
I want to run
a whole feature on Yeom Jangseon.

503
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,354
That's the goal.

504
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:52,028
But the wiretaps are saved by date,
so pulling the files on him takes time.

505
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:53,154
Is that okay?

506
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,376
Sir.

507
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,295
Do you remember journalist Ma Jaeyeol?

508
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,174
The one obsessed with the Dandelion?

509
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,012
He came by multiple times
after hearing rumors that I had it.

510
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
Apparently, he also visited
the Administrator several times.

511
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,810
So he's been digging deep.

512
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,687
The day I brought you to Daesan,

513
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,023
I saw him talking with Director Seo.

514
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,485
At the time,
I figured he was just covering a story.

515
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,697
But if he got the Dandelion
from the Administrator

516
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,324
and Dongju caught on to that…

517
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,450
Find out what he knows.

518
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,660
Yes, sir.

519
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,682
How about a cup of coffee?

520
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,142
Thank you.

521
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,893
Let's go.

522
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,831
Did Mr. Yeom say that?

523
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:32,378
He thinks I've got the Dandelion
just because I stopped sniffing around?

524
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,462
Yes.

525
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,884
So he told me to ask you
how much you'd sell it for.

526
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,344
Ten billion won?

527
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,355
You really don't have the Dandelion?

528
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,108
Of course not.

529
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,195
If I did, I would've published it already.

530
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,280
Why would I sit on something that big?

531
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,044
JOURNALIST MA JAEYEOL

532
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,504
Yes, Mr. Ma.

533
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,717
Is that so?

534
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:24,138
I do have a guess as to why
Cheon Guho's suddenly on the move.

535
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,599
I've been wondering about this.

536
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,392
Did you

537
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,103
get these files from the Administrator?

538
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,147
I found what the Administrator…

539
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,399
was hiding.

540
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,318
<i>Instrument market?</i>

541
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,611
Yes, sir.

542
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,697
According to his dashcam,
it's somewhere he'd never gone before.

543
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,407
But now he goes every day.

544
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,994
If we check
the building's security cameras,

545
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,329
we might find something.

546
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,122
Since he's been going often.

547
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,084
<i>Yes, sir.
I'll search the whole building.</i>

548
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,753
Delicious <i>ramyeon!</i>

549
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,507
This stuff hits the spot every time.

550
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,599
Jeez.

551
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,228
Hold on.

552
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,497
Who the hell are you?
What the hell is this?

553
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,832
Jang Ilnam.

554
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,382
What the hell! No, you bastards!

555
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,466
No!

556
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,981
Hey.

557
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,901
So it's the guy who ran off
with Seo Dongju by the ocean?

558
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,030
Yes, it's Jang Ilnam.
His real name is Bae Wonbae.

559
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,658
He did something illegal as a nurse
and is now wanted.

560
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,119
So…

561
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,414
it wasn't Ma Jaeyeol
but Seo Dongju all along?

562
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,043
How about the Dandelion?

563
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,337
We searched
but couldn't find the original.

564
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,505
He wouldn't stash it somewhere obvious.

565
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,133
We're still analyzing
the computer we brought in.

566
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,885
Good. That's how it should be.

567
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:32,475
So that's the card he's been holding.
No wonder he's been so damn cocky.

568
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,936
SEONG BOYEON

569
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,357
MAKE SOME RADISH SOUP

570
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,118
Why are you staring?

571
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,705
I just found myself looking.

572
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,082
The Dandelion.

573
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,251
It's something we lost.
Return it to its rightful owner.

574
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,339
What's that?

575
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,512
I just work at the instrument shop.

576
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,430
I don't know anything.

577
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,065
Then instead of him, get Myeong Taegeum.

578
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,525
- She's the hacker, right?
- Yes.

579
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,736
She just goes around bluffing.

580
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,739
She can't even use a spreadsheet
but calls herself a hacker?

581
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,616
Even a pigeon would crack up.

582
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,742
Is that so?

583
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,161
Then I guess it's you, Mr. Jang Ilnam.

584
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,083
The Dandelion.

585
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,130
Tell me where it is.

586
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,052
But I don't know what it is.

587
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,389
I can't give you something
I don't even know.

588
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,724
I honestly have no clue.

589
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,893
Think carefully.

590
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,896
Until you remember,
you can't leave this room.

591
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,023
I know your real name.

592
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,568
It's Bae Wonbae, not Jang Ilnam.

593
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,865
Actually, no. I should rough you up first.

594
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,086
Ilnam.

595
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,217
Ilnam?

596
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,046
MYEONG TAEGEUM

597
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,848
MYEONG TAEGEUM

598
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,892
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

599
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,228
I think Cheon Guho took Ilnam.

600
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,105
I'll try to call him.
He could be hiding somewhere.

601
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,857
His phone…

602
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,235
was on the floor.

603
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,405
<i>They'll figure out by tomorrow morning
that there's nothing on the computer.</i>

604
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,825
Then they'll pressure Ilnam
to get him to hand it over.

605
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,161
<i>What do we do?</i>

606
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,681
You'll need us.

607
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,308
Guho's guys are all tough.

608
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,893
I know. I've run into them before.

609
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,854
I have the addresses and door codes
for all the empty units.

610
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,858
I'll sweep the places with my guys
and let you know, Director Seo.

611
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,027
And these are the floor plans.

612
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,994
The place they're holding your friend,
it's probably near the House of Overflow.

613
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,954
For Mr. Yeom's convenience.

614
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,418
Administrator…

615
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,672
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I took the Dandelion.

616
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,674
It's okay.

617
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,011
I never thought
Mr. Yeom would go that far.

618
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,973
Why is Yeom Jangseon

619
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,976
so desperate to get the Dandelion back?

620
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:48,022
A wiretap in there recorded
something he never wants getting out.

621
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,482
What is it?

622
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,567
I don't know.

623
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,778
I've never listened to anything
since I cut ties with Dandelion.

624
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,074
By the way,

625
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,661
why didn't you
get rid of the Dandelion files?

626
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:03,829
I don't know.

627
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,540
I just never thought of that.

628
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,250
Maybe the Dandelion…

629
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,211
was meant to end up with you.

630
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:29,730
<i>From this end to the
other, every building has dozens of units</i>

631
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,274
<i>owned by companies under Mr. Yeom's name.</i>

632
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:43,577
SEOUL DREAM HYUNDAI APARTMENT

633
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,461
They're not here.

634
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,090
PLUTO APARTMENT, UNIT 608, EMPTY

635
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,476
{\an8}SEOUL DREAM HYUNDAI APARTMENT,
1403, EMPTY

636
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,527
They're not here.

637
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,071
They're not here.

638
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,166
Nothing?

639
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,469
UNIT 602, EMPTY
UNIT 501, EMPTY

640
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,986
INCOMING CALL
THE ELDER

641
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,029
Yes, sir.

642
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,582
You memorized it all, right?

643
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,334
Yes. Some of the names
overlapped with the last list,

644
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,420
so it was easier.

645
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,464
Always a little different.

646
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,094
Find a way to deliver it
without drawing attention.

647
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,054
That's the most important part.

648
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:27,556
No trace.

649
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,349
Yes, sir.

650
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:31,935
You can go now.

651
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,314
Sir…

652
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,609
I have a favor to ask of you.

653
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:45,574
Give me more.

654
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,576
You must be in a good mood today.

655
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,037
Seeing that you want more soup.

656
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,879
- It's hot.
- Okay.

657
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,054
Jangseon.

658
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:11,016
Dongju's asking
if you could let his friend go.

659
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,102
The one you've been holding
and roughing up.

660
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,985
<i>It's the first favor he's ever asked me
and I've got face to save,</i>

661
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,071
<i>so do me this one.</i>

662
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,156
Yes, sir.

663
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,951
I'll take good care of it.

664
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,246
Radish is in season.
Treat yourself to some radish soup.

665
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,347
Shouldn't he be here by now?

666
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,978
Come on. He'll show up any second,
going, "Hey, Dongju!"

667
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,788
That crazy old bastard, Yeom Jangseon.

668
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,712
These bastards…

669
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,965
They'll kill him
if we don't hand over the Dandelion.

670
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,607
Chief Cheon.

671
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,791
LEE CHEOLYONG, NAM SANGCHEOL

672
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,587
{\an8}PROSECUTION, DAESAN GROUP

673
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,183
No backups, right, Director Seo?

674
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,476
There aren't any.

675
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,437
I don't play games with my friend's life.

676
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,082
<i>Got the photo of Jang Ilnam?</i>

677
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:25,335
Even after that,
he fought back and got beaten more.

678
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,089
If he dies, that's all…

679
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,632
on you.

680
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,428
He's still alive though.

681
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:39,850
So why involve your friend in exposing
the Dandelion to embarrass me?

682
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:42,936
I want to put out that fire

683
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,648
and dig up whatever it is
you're so desperate to keep buried.

684
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,235
Why you were so desperate
to get your hands on it.

685
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,780
I was desperate to find the Dandelion?
Who says that?

686
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:58,493
Who took my friend hostage and forced me
to bring the Dandelion all the way here?

687
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,833
Now that you've burned it,
you can relax and be ashamed in private.

688
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,460
Without anyone knowing.

689
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,257
Hey, Seo Dongju.

690
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,429
There's nothing in the Dandelion
I'm ashamed of.

691
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,640
Not a single thing.

692
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,518
I just don't want

693
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:26,188
a bunch of clueless idiots
to hear those recordings

694
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,815
and drag my name into their gossip.

695
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,694
Denying it all like you're proud

696
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,322
because you're too ashamed
to admit the truth?

697
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,740
I completely get it.

698
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,950
I'm not like you amateurs.

699
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,537
Have you ever sacrificed anything
for the greater good

700
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,539
instead of your own gain?

701
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:51,379
From the very first day
I wore the badge of public office,

702
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,050
I never once put myself first.

703
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,595
It was always the country.
Always the cause.

704
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,890
When the rest
of those cowardly bastards stood back

705
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:05,310
to protect their own hides,
I, Yeom Jangseon,

706
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,731
faced the criticism
and did what had to be done.

707
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,777
Only for the good of this nation,
I ran and kept running.

708
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,280
You're more shameless than I expected.

709
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,660
I nearly died multiple times
because of you.

710
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,662
How could you say that to my face?

711
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:26,790
That's on you
for refusing to stand by my cause.

712
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,376
Excuse me?

713
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,586
You're the one who ran
from the suicide squad.

714
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,339
The suicide squad?

715
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,466
You should've died with Manager Yoo.

716
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,927
That way,
the National Patriotism Fund pyramid

717
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,096
would've been complete.

718
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,267
Don't talk so lightly
about a person's life.

719
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,562
Dongju,

720
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,605
you swallowed

721
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,942
two trillion won
from the National Patriotism Fund

722
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,403
and sacrificed your sister
just to keep it.

723
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,948
She was no different than a stranger.

724
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:05,120
Who the hell gives up
their sister for money?

725
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,497
You're the one who killed her!

726
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,625
If you had given the money back,
I wouldn't have had to!

727
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,962
Who do you think
your sister blames in the afterlife?

728
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,673
Me or you, the greedy bastard?

729
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,300
What did you just say?

730
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,597
Hey, Guho.

731
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,765
Throw this bastard off the roof.

732
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,773
MA JAEYEOL TV

733
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,162
{\an8} <i>He's still alive though.</i>

734
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,416
{\an8}<i>So why involve your friend in exposing
the Dandelion to embarrass me?</i>

735
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,339
<i>You swallowed</i>

736
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,509
<i>two trillion won
from the National Patriotism Fund…</i>

737
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,428
{\an8}<i>and sacrificed your sister
just to keep it.</i>

738
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,891
<i>Who the hell
gives up their sister for money?</i>

739
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,185
<i>You're the one who killed her!</i>

740
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,146
{\an8}<i>If you had given
the money back, I wouldn't have had to!</i>

741
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:16,167
{\an8}
UNCOVERING THE TRUTH ABOUT YEOM JANGSEON!

742
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,216
The Dandelion files you burned,
that was plan A.

743
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:27,887
And <i>Ma Jaeyeol TV</i> is plan B, sir.
