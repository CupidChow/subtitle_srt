<i>two trillion won

The Dandelion files you burned,
that was plan A.

18
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,172
And <i>Ma Jaeyeol TV</i> is plan B, sir.

19
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,931
What are you trying to do, Director Seo?

20
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,475
Your video confession
about instigating murder

21
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,687
will begin circulating online from now on.

22
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,232
I wonder if you'll still be able
to hold your head high then.

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,362
A handful of people gossiping,
whom you've written off as fools,

24
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,450
is nothing like a video
that spreads endlessly online, sir.

25
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,078
A confession without evidence?

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,454
Don't you know I can just say

27
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,251
that I got tricked,
got emotional, and blurted out nonsense?

28
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,255
How foolish.

29
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,673
People are way more interested

30
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,802
in whose head
that two trillion won is sitting in.

31
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,013
I guess.

32
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,475
Thanks to you

33
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,689
labeling me as the guy
who stole the National Patriotism Fund,

34
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,984
now the whole world's watching me.

35
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,445
If I suddenly disappear or turn up dead,

36
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,992
the whole world
will assume it was your doing.

37
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,583
The Elder called personally.

38
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,004
I'll have the car ready.

{\an8}EPISODE 15

40
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,428
{\an8}Thanks to the little stunt
you pulled today,

41
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,473
{\an8}we both have some mess to clean up.

42
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,143
{\an8}But I'll get through it just fine.

43
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,604
{\an8}I'm worried about you.

44
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,148
{\an8}Why did you kill President Huh?

45
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,903
{\an8}Are you asking for round two?

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,620
{\an8}No cameras. No recordings.

47
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,664
{\an8}I'm asking
because I genuinely want to know.

48
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,666
{\an8}You and President Huh...

49
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,336
{\an8}You two go way back.

50
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,505
Why did you kill him?

51
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,882
He got too cocky.

52
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,762
There's not a single thing

53
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,724
Huh Ildo got at Daesan
that wasn't thanks to me.

54
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,727
I had the master plan for the future.

55
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
I gave the orders.

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,315
Huh Ildo just followed them
like a servant.

57
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,859
He was my hands and feet.

58
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,779
He obeyed so well.

59
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,782
I gave him shade in the scorching sun,

60
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,118
let him warm up in the storm,

61
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,286
even let him sit at the same table.

62
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,373
And he actually started thinking...

63
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,875
he was my equal.

64
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,002
He dared...

65
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,841
to tell me to step away from Daesan.

66
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,552
If you ask me,

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,265
the thoughtless comment
that got your father killed?

68
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,600
It all started with you, Dongju.

69
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,229
If you hadn't shaken your father,

70
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,481
he would've never...

71
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,027
even thought of saying
something like that.

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,573
Dongju.

73
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,618
Your father died because of you.

74
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,000
Other than this cost-free repentance,

75
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,378
was there really nothing good for you?

76
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:25,051
Deciding to break free from Yeom Jangseon
and finally stand up to him.

77
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,554
Ever since I got caught in college

78
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,349
and gave up my friends' names,
this is the first time

79
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,727
<i>I've stood up to Yeom Jangseon.</i>

80
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,606
Are you smiling?

81
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,858
You're right.

82
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,904
My father died because of me,
Mr. Yeom Jangseon.

83
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,707
No, I'm not eating.

84
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm really not hungry, Secretary Gong.

85
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,338
I've gained weight since moving here.

86
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,839
Okay.

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,549
Okay.

88
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,193
<i>Who the hell
gives up their sister for money?</i>

89
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,528
<i>You're the one who killed her!</i>

90
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,116
<i>- If you had given the money</i>...
- Dongju?

91
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,535
<i>Who do you think
your sister blames in the afterlife?</i>

92
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,246
<i>Me or you, the greedy bastard?</i>

93
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,124
Mom, Father!

94
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,918
What's wrong, Seonu?

95
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,002
Look at this.

96
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,505
<i>No backups, right, Director Seo?</i>

97
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,298
{\an8}- ...<i>two trillion won from...</i>
- So...

98
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,925
Dongju stole two million...

99
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,844
No, two trillion won
and someone killed his sister over it!

100
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,721
<i>She was no different
than a stranger.</i>

101
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,766
{\an8}<i>Who the hell gives up
their sister for money?</i>

102
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,768
{\an8}<i>You're the one who killed her!</i>

103
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>If you had given
the money back, I wouldn't have had to!</i>

104
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,192
<i>Who do you think
your sister blames in the afterlife?</i>

105
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,986
<i>Me or you, the greedy bastard?</i>

106
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,114
<i>What did you just say?</i>

107
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,704
How's Ilnam?

108
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,373
He almost didn't make it.

109
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,835
His body's covered
in trauma from the beating.

110
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,920
It's very serious.

111
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,797
He should be groaning

112
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,510
and crying out in pain,
but he's holding it all in.

113
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,762
One person came in with a gunshot wound.

114
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,141
Now another's beaten half to death.

115
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,976
What are you going to do?

116
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,396
Let Mr. Bae go.

117
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,524
His life is already hard as it is.

118
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,619
Are you okay?

119
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,204
Yes, I'm fine.

120
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,581
Is your leg broken?

121
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm fine.

122
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,671
That meddlesome Dr. Park,
he's talking nonsense.

123
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,258
If it hurts,

124
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,469
just scream out loud
instead of holding it in.

125
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,057
I was given a shot.

126
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
I'll be fine.

127
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,775
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,237
The video Mr. Ma uploaded,

129
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,947
I saw it.

130
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,992
I really wanted to see
Yeom Jangseon confess

131
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,703
his crimes with his own mouth.

132
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,874
The two trillion won you hacked
got exposed too.

133
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,667
I expected that.

134
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,504
So what now?

135
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,050
<i>Hey, Guho.</i>

136
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,636
<i>Throw this bastard off the roof.</i>

137
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,018
Have some.

138
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,896
Soon, Mr. Yeom
is going to burst through that door,

139
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,524
come charging in, and lash out at us.

140
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,443
To not let him get to you,
you should have some tea

141
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,196
and get yourself in the right headspace.

142
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,281
Have some.

143
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,418
Told you.
Not even a hint of guilt on his face.

144
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,635
You're here
because of that idiot Seo Dongju, right?

145
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,605
You must've been so startled
and deeply shocked.

146
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,731
Don't worry.

147
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,527
We just need to say
the video was fabricated.

148
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,321
I'll get the online team moving.

149
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,200
In three days,
no one will believe the video.

150
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,537
You didn't come
all the way out here at this hour

151
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,040
to argue about what's true or not, right?

152
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,586
I warned you

153
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,549
if you messed with Director Seo again,
it'd be a declaration of war against me.

154
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,550
Why did you ignore it?

155
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,635
I didn't ignore it. Not once.

156
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,847
Are you saying Director Seo
acted on his own and started all this?

157
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm hurt.

158
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,977
You're siding with him?
The one who caused this?

159
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,729
He's not taking his side.

160
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,565
The Elder said from the start
that Director Seo was dangerous.

161
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,193
He always stayed on guard.

162
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,904
Bring me the two trillion won
Director Seo took.

163
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:41,575
From that moment on,
I'll pretend Seo Dongju never existed.

164
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,660
But until then,

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,205
don't lay a finger on him.

166
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,793
Brother.

167
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,378
What now? Why call me that again?

168
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,383
How about I bring you something bigger
than the two trillion in his head?

169
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,428
- There's such a thing?
- Of course, there is.

170
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,306
Daesan Group.

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,016
For now, Daesan Energy.

172
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,476
What are you planning to do?

173
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,896
I'm setting up a bottomless fund

174
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,106
to ensure your successor
wins the presidency,

175
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,609
followed by victories...

176
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,945
in the general and local elections.

177
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,449
I'll take care of everything.

178
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,454
You just step in and give a little nudge
when I need your help.

179
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,837
Since <i>Ma Jaeyeol TV</i>'s report,
rumors and speculative articles

180
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,384
on Professor Yeom Jangseon
and Director Seo Dongju of Daesan Group

181
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:45,097
have flooded the internet with none of
the allegations being properly addressed.

182
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,809
Ten days have passed
in this pointless back-and-forth.

183
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,853
What are the prosecutors and police doing?

184
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,606
Are they waiting on
a signal from the higher-ups?

185
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,109
The prosecution must immediately

186
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,279
launch an investigation
into the Daesan Energy slush fund,

187
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,659
which clearly appears connected
to this administration's energy projects.

188
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,595
Did you watch the press conference?

189
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,896
I loved that you said
Seo Dongju's name loud and clear.

190
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,277
Let's finally get something out
of that old study-abroad friendship.

191
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,031
And the Daesan Energy employee
you said you'd introduce?

192
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,955
Nice to meet you,
Assemblywoman Seok Sugyeong.

193
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,547
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,176
I've received word from CEO Cha Gukhui.

195
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,387
She's currently in discussions
with Assemblywoman Seok Sugyeong

196
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,558
and Daesan Energy's finance manager,
Hong Munhan, to decide their next steps.

197
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,310
<i>Listen carefully, Ms. Ji.</i>

198
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,064
At the press conference,
Assemblywoman Seok made it crystal clear

199
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:21,693
that Seo Dongju is at the center
of the slush fund tied to Daesan Energy.

200
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,236
Now we push further.

201
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,324
We need to find proof that Seo Dongju
is the one who came up with those dollars

202
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,785
in the chairman's vault.

203
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,953
But, sir,

204
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:36,374
I'm worried this could also
put the chairman in danger.

205
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,419
<i>I won't let that happen.</i>

206
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,337
<i>Ms. Ji.</i>

207
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,132
Seo Dongju is the only one
who knows the vault code.

208
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,511
He's been spending
the cash like it's his own.

209
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,846
It has nothing to do with the chairman.

210
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay.

211
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,268
I trust you, sir.

212
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,978
Of course, you should.

213
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,065
Ms. Ji, this time,

214
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,983
it's about removing
Seo Dongju from Daesan,

215
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,946
like plucking a single hair with tweezers.

216
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,802
SISTER AGNES, SEO YEONJU

217
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,657
Yeonju.

218
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,677
Why are you here again?

219
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,387
I'm not taking the college entrance exam.

220
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,931
Let me become a nun.

221
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,601
Then do it.

222
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,022
What? Did Jesus say you needed
permission from your brother?

223
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,609
I can only leave home with peace of mind
if you're good on your own.

224
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,154
Yeonju, the food I eat, the booze,

225
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,489
the gas for my bike,
these clothes, shoes...

226
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,117
They're all from the salary
Madame Pi paid me.

227
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,495
What more do I have to do to prove it?

228
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,666
So, don't worry about me
and go become a nun.

229
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,003
Seo Dongju!

230
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,760
Start studying again.

231
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,013
If you try it and still hate it
and choose to quit on your own,

232
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll accept that.

233
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,017
It's not even your fault.

234
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,396
Yeom Huicheol and his uncle
framed you and got you kicked out.

235
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,191
If you give up your studies now,

236
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,527
it'll feel like
you're admitting their lies were true.

237
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,738
I'll carry that pain forever.

238
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,283
Dongju, you're my proud savior.

239
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,702
Here we go again.

240
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,288
Can you please stop calling me that?

241
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,458
How can you call your brother your savior
when you believe in Jesus?

242
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,961
Jesus knows too.

243
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:26,921
That you're my savior.

244
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
If I could go back...

245
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,567
If I hadn't gone to college...

246
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,486
and if I hadn't joined Daesan,

247
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,700
you'd still be here
as a nun at the church, right?

248
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,248
But I can't go back.

249
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,253
So I'm going to end this now.

250
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,109
The scandal that started
with <i>Ma Jaeyeol TV</i> is being framed as

251
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,361
a personal conflict between
Yeom Jangseon and Seo Dongju.

252
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,742
We've been consistent in messaging that
Daesan has nothing to do with it, sir.

253
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,579
What bothers me is Assemblywoman Seok's
surprise press conference.

254
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,373
Daesan's name came up again.

255
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,917
Have you seen Director Seo?

256
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,587
I figured it'd only make things worse
if he showed his face,

257
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,422
so I told him not to come in for a while.

258
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,716
Mmm.

259
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,476
Chairman, I have something to say.

260
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,061
Okay.

261
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,105
Sure, come and have a seat.

262
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,817
I'll excuse myself.

263
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,903
Okay.

264
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,488
See me after this.

265
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,865
Okay.

266
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,166
What is it?

267
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,959
Chairman.

268
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,921
Don't we need to appoint
a new CEO for Daesan Energy?

269
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,215
Of course.

270
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,718
I was just discussing that
with the vice chairman.

271
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,597
I need to become the CEO of Daesan Energy.

272
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,517
What?

273
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,727
What did you just say?

274
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,904
Come on in, Deokhui.

275
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,918
I heard from Seonu's father
that you've agreed to help Seonu.

276
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,921
Ms. Ji.

277
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,383
I know you put him up to it
behind our backs.

278
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,595
If this is your way of thanking me,
save it.

279
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:27,351
In return for taking care of Seonu,
I got plenty of Daesan Volt shares.

280
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,647
I am

281
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,899
at least trying to accept

282
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,944
that Seonu is my father's son.

283
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,281
So let's keep things low-key between us.

284
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,037
We're not done here.

285
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
Deokhui.

286
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,131
Recommend me

287
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,593
for the chairman
of the Cha Daebok Cultural Foundation.

288
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,265
It was discussed with Seonu's father.

289
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,434
It doesn't matter.

290
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,980
Let me tell you exactly
why you can't get that position.

291
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,064
Firstly,

292
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:19,987
it's the same reason I'm not the chair
and just a board member.

293
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,617
That position should go
to someone with public respect.

294
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,413
It's a way to show the world that
the foundation is run transparently.

295
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,708
Secondly,

296
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,628
your personal qualifications.

297
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:42,550
Besides seducing my elderly father,
do you even have any real skills?

298
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,636
Watch...

299
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,054
your mouth.

300
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,849
You brought up
the chairmanship recommendation first,

301
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,438
so I'm just stating the facts about why
you aren't fit enough. What's the issue?

302
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,486
You quit being an anchor so long ago,
it barely counts as experience.

303
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,363
Baking bread at a local bakery,

304
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:08,160
then scheming your way
into the Daesan family...

305
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,624
That doesn't suit a foundation
built on transparency and public good.

306
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,002
Do you need more reasons?

307
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,345
When Seonu was young,

308
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,809
I stepped back
from your cheap and trashy threats.

309
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,727
I did it

310
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,313
to protect my son, Seonu.

311
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,108
But I'm done staying silent.

312
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,569
And if you are?

313
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,322
As the wife of Daesan Group's Chairman,

314
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,366
as your stepmother,

315
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,785
I'll start guiding the stepdaughters

316
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,372
and shape the family values.

317
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:59,336
So that my son, Cha Seonu,
can inherit Daesan properly.

318
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,760
Ouch!

319
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,471
Let go of me. Now!

320
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,764
Let go!

321
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,266
Let go of me.

322
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,393
Let go...

323
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,316
Please let me go.

324
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,152
Let go, Deokhui!

325
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,616
<i>You want to become CEO
for Seonu?</i>

326
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,618
Yes, Chairman.

327
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,579
Who do you truly believe is more fit

328
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:38,208
to guide and protect Seonu's future
between Mr. Yeom and me?

329
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,961
If it benefits himself,
he would toss Seonu aside

330
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,838
and pick Taeyun without hesitation.

331
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,131
You know that.

332
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:49,677
Taeyun is your younger brother.
It's only natural you'd favor him.

333
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,846
Chairman,

334
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,265
the only thing I'm loyal to...

335
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,267
is Daesan.

336
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,521
But you don't even own Daesan.
Why are you so invested?

337
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,899
Because of Yeom Jangseon.

338
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,987
All I want is to stop Yeom Jangseon
from targeting Daesan, Chairman.

339
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,954
Yeom is already living well
off Daesan's money,

340
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,747
quietly pulling the strings.

341
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,959
So why would he want to take Daesan?

342
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,670
Could he even pull that off?

343
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,547
Chairman.

344
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,426
Do you remember
when Daesan Energy nearly collapsed

345
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,888
because the oil import
credit line was blocked?

346
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:40,311
Throwing Daesan Energy into chaos
just to make Huh Ildo look like the hero

347
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,688
and seat him as chairman.

348
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,315
Yeom Jangseon planned the whole thing.

349
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,570
His goal was to run Daesan
however he wanted

350
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,740
once you stepped down
and Huh Ildo took over.

351
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,826
So...

352
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,706
it wasn't Yeom who persuaded the Elder?

353
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,295
TO ELDER

354
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,300
Come in.

355
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,436
My name is Seo Dongju.

356
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,062
Thank you for responding.

357
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,983
Your message today saved my life, sir.

358
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,902
I'm currently getting treated
at Daesan Hospital,

359
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:34,074
pretending to be unconscious
to avoid Yeom Jangseon's murder attempts.

360
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,870
The things in your message...

361
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,914
How can I be sure they're true?

362
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,042
I can withdraw
the exact amount you request right now

363
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,210
from the National Patriotism Fund
in Switzerland

364
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,088
and wire it wherever you want.

365
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,389
Before that...

366
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,853
Mr. Yeom is blocking Daesan Energy's
crude oil import credit.

367
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,814
I'd like to ask for you to step in, sir.

368
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,485
<i>Chairman.</i>

369
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,403
I'm the only one
who can stop Yeom Jangseon.

370
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,572
Why only you?

371
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,116
There are me, the vice chairman,

372
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,744
all the affiliate CEOs,
and the board members...

373
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,204
And even Gukhui, and...

374
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,166
Yeom Jangseon is trying to kill me

375
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,754
because I have the only weapon
that can stand against him, Chairman.

376
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,175
Once I stop Yeom Jangseon,

377
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,345
I'll step down from the CEO position.

378
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,062
Please don't let Yeom Jangseon sway you,

379
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,941
and make a wise decision, Chairman.

380
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,662
<i>Mr. Yeom says</i>

381
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:07,751
Director Seo is the most dangerous person
to Seonu inside Daesan.

382
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,712
Director Seo is full of ambition.

383
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,799
He's bound to clash with Seonu eventually.

384
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,485
How about some tea?

385
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,370
I saw the video.

386
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,375
Why are you doing something so dangerous?

387
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,460
He even tried to kill me,
his own niece-in-law,

388
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,421
because I rubbed him the wrong way.

389
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,090
Don't worry, Eunnam.

390
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,884
I shot that video

391
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,095
so Mr. Yeom couldn't do anything to me.

392
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,725
I'll be fine.

393
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,895
The man who attacked you
and President Huh...

394
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,813
Mr. Yeom sent him, right?

395
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
Dongju,

396
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,408
how about you give it all up
and leave Daesan?

397
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,332
Eunnam.

398
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,754
The only thing I can do now...

399
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,634
is get Yeom Jangseon out of Daesan.

400
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,304
When I was a new hire,

401
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,475
my goal was to become chairman
of Daesan someday.

402
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,312
And also to marry you
after I was promoted to director.

403
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,276
It's not about literally
becoming chairman.

404
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:01,281
More like how aiming to be president
might land you a minister's seat.

405
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,659
If I dream of being chairman,

406
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,662
maybe I'd end up running a subsidiary.

407
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,998
It's a big ambition with no guarantee...

408
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:11,916
of success.

409
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,085
Just a vague goal.

410
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,590
But right now, my goal at Daesan is clear.

411
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,843
Getting rid of Yeom Jangseon.

412
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,687
Dongju.

413
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,149
The kid in that photo...

414
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,860
That kid...

415
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,239
It was you, wasn't it?

416
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,206
The kid in my dad's arms isn't me.

417
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,625
Do you know who this kid is?

418
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:56,920
That kid?

419
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,840
I don't know either.

420
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,261
Dongju, you told me...

421
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,889
we were caught in a net...

422
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,518
woven by our parents
and all those adults.

423
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,938
Do you think we can ever...

424
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,690
break free from it without getting hurt?

425
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,942
You asked me that.

426
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,739
I finally understand why you asked that.

427
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:31,288
You know that my mom made President Huh
kill you, your mom, and my dad.

428
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,876
So how could you ever think
to beg me for forgiveness in his place?

429
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,880
Because I know exactly
what your pain feels like.

430
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,956
Hello. Welcome, Ms. Ji.

431
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,958
Apologies for dropping by unannounced.

432
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,670
That makes me even happier to see you.
Come on in.

433
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,219
This is the first time you've ever
come to visit me without me asking.

434
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,014
This kind of quiet,
proactive move of yours...

435
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,183
I like it.

436
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,950
This is a part of the fund records
from the chairman's inner office vault.

437
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,161
You've already gotten your hands on it?

438
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,413
Let's see...

439
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,292
Do I put Assemblywoman Seok Sugyeong
in front of the press again

440
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,837
or hand this straight to the prosecutors?

441
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:06,716
When exactly will Director Seo
be leaving Daesan?

442
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,345
You hate him that much?

443
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,141
The chairman is keeping his distance,
so he's fine.

444
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,519
But Seonu is completely drawn in.
To a worrying degree.

445
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,771
That's what he's good at.

446
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,025
Even the chairman was once taken in
until I helped him see clearly.

447
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,614
Does Seonu know...

448
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,119
Seo Dongju and Huh Taeyun are brothers?

449
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,203
Yes.

450
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,707
Dongju might seem like
he's on Seonu's side now,

451
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:44,171
but in the end, he'll choose
his own blood, Huh Taeyun.

452
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,342
Make sure you drill it into Seonu's head.

453
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,042
I told Dongju to do as he wished.

454
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,920
After all, he's my father's son too.

455
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,340
So Dongju and Taeyun are brothers?

456
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,752
You came.

457
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,923
You camped out in my house
demanding to see me, how could I not?

458
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,385
Why did you want to meet?

459
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,805
Don't be so nervous, Ms. Cha.

460
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,391
I'm not here about the past.

461
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,143
I'm still

462
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,397
not ready to talk with you
about what happened back then.

463
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,902
Sometimes, I resent you so much...

464
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,364
that I feel like I could kill you.

465
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,409
That's all I'll say.

466
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,204
You say you're not ready
to talk about the past

467
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,333
but then tell me you want to kill me?

468
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,002
Am I not even allowed to say that much?

469
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,924
More importantly,
to remove Yeom Jangseon from Daesan,

470
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,093
I need to become CEO of Daesan Energy.

471
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,055
Why are you telling me this?

472
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,810
You want me to use my Daesan Energy shares

473
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,146
to back you?

474
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,149
That position...

475
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,363
That's the position Gukhui is eyeing too.

476
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,867
This isn't the time to worry
about your sister's feelings.

477
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,953
Ms. Ji

478
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,248
is using Yeom Jangseon
to sway the chairman.

479
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,879
If this continues,
Taeyun's future will be completely erased.

480
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,015
Fine. But

481
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,892
only if you sign a waiver right here,

482
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,230
renouncing your claim
to President Huh's inheritance.

483
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,190
Why would I?

484
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,235
Aren't you here to ask for my help?

485
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,405
You've misunderstood.

486
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,199
With Taeyun's future so uncertain,

487
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,369
you need to depend on me.

488
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,329
I'm here to tell you that.

489
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,397
Professor Yeom Jangseon is

490
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,648
leaking the slush fund story

491
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,236
ahead of Assemblywoman Seok Sugyeong's
press conference.

492
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,906
Time to act before he does.

493
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,992
How do you respond to the ruling

494
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,621
that Professor Yeom
wasn't involved in the deaths

495
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,876
of Manager Yoo and Sister Agnes
raised on <i>Ma Jaeyeol TV?</i>

496
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,586
We've submitted
new evidence to the prosecution.

497
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,963
I urge them to reopen the case.

498
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,382
Not only has
Professor Yeom Jangseon denied

499
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,926
any link to Manager Yoo
or Sister Agnes's deaths,

500
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,388
he also claimed the
National Patriotism Fund never existed.

501
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,806
What's your take on that?

502
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,976
Once an official investigation
into the fund begins,

503
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,269
I'll speak to that.

504
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,023
Even after Assemblywoman
Seok Sugyeong's press conference,

505
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,985
prosecutors still show no signs
of pursuing the case.

506
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,822
I think someone is actively
blocking the investigation.

507
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,034
<i>Do you want
to become CEO of Daesan Energy</i>

508
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,621
<i>to follow in President Huh's
footsteps as his son?</i>

509
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,581
<i>I've wanted to lead Daesan Energy</i>

510
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:16,418
<i>long before I knew
President Huh was my father.</i>

511
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,504
Turn it off.

512
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,887
He'll only speak to it once an official
investigation into the fund begins...

513
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,932
He says that

514
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,976
knowing full well
neither I nor the Elder can go public.

515
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,896
Goodness.

516
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,735
This jerk... Seriously.

517
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,072
ELDER

518
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,449
Damn it.

519
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,707
It's Yeom Jangseon!

520
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,095
Director Seo submitted
new evidence linking you

521
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,306
to the death of Manager Yoo.
Do you admit to the charges?

522
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,766
Let's talk up there.

523
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,561
The prosecution said
they were still coordinating an interview.

524
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,480
Why suddenly show up voluntarily?

525
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,357
PROSECUTION SERVICE

526
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,527
Chairman Cha Gangcheon
of Daesan Group and I

527
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,865
have been close friends for years.

528
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,285
But my friend is ill.

529
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,619
He has dementia.

530
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,455
- Dementia?
- He has dementia?

531
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
But just yesterday,

532
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,587
he attended a breakfast hosted
by the American Chamber of Commerce.

533
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,964
Would that even be possible
if he has dementia?

534
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,634
Some people said they saw his symptoms
of dementia at his wedding.

535
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,802
So is it true?

536
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,346
- Are you sure about this?
- How do you know this?

537
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,639
Do you have proof?

538
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,684
While my friend was vulnerable
due to dementia,

539
00:39:55,685 --> 00:40:00,314
Seo Dongju took advantage of him
and tried to destroy Daesan Group.

540
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:04,903
When I caught Director Seo looting Daesan,
he turned around and framed me.

541
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,282
I'll fully cooperate
with today's investigation.

542
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,199
But do you have proof...

543
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,243
Do you have proof that
Chairman Cha has dementia?

544
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,913
- Do you have proof?
- Can you take responsibility for that?

545
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,416
A lot of <i>Daesan Daily</i> reporters are here.

546
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,627
I have the diagnosis right here.

547
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,004
It's his privacy,
so I can't show it out here,

548
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,173
{\an8}<i>but I'll submit it as evidence today.</i>

549
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,301
{\an8}PROFESSOR YEOM JANGSEON
REPORTS TO THE PROSECUTION

550
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,014
What a goddamn bastard!

551
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,953
The chairman's collapsed!

552
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,371
Chairman!

553
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,789
- Father!
- Chairman!

554
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,749
- Father, what's wrong?
- Chairman.

555
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,043
First, let's...

556
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,754
What... Are you okay?

557
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,218
- Mom, get the car ready.
- Okay.

558
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,973
Hurry! Get the car ready.

559
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,934
Mom, I'll bring the car
around to the front.

560
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,278
As you get older, food becomes medicine.

561
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,239
When I saw him take
just three bites at breakfast,

562
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,491
I knew something was off. Goodness.

563
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,868
If he dies like this,

564
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,704
they'll say the new person
brought bad luck.

565
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,374
Oh, no. Madam Ji Yeongsu is in trouble.

566
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,710
Be careful what you say.

567
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,461
Besides, if the chairman passes,

568
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,172
the two of us who are
only needed to serve his table

569
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,341
will be out the door.

570
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,553
Goodness.

571
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:58,181
<i>After Professor Yeom Jangseon's
claim about Chairman Cha's dementia,</i>

572
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,393
<i>Daesan Group's stocks across
all subsidiaries have plummeted.</i>

573
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,521
<i>As it is well known
that Chairman Cha has been</i>

574
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,024
<i>making decisions for the group,</i>

575
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,276
<i>the revelation of his illness</i>

576
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,279
<i>is expected to have
a devastating impact on Daesan Group.</i>

577
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,490
Yes, I understand. I'll do that.

578
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,665
Ms. Ji said the chairman's
stomach spasms have eased.

579
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,708
That's a relief.

580
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,834
By the way,

581
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,795
Professor Yeom... Goodness.

582
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,880
He must be insane.

583
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,215
Looks like he exposed
the chairman's illness

584
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,554
to drop Daesan's stock and buy it up cheap
with his investors and fund allies.

585
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,474
As long as we resolve
this instability around the chairman,

586
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,934
the stock will bounce back in no time.

587
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,563
Mr. Yeom knows Daesan Group's situation
better than anyone.

588
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,774
If the chairman weren't in the hospital,

589
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,860
we could call in the press
and show everyone he's fine.

590
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,153
We can't do that.

591
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,321
Why not?

592
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,575
If his condition suddenly worsens
in front of the press,

593
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,495
it'll be impossible to contain.

594
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,380
Seonu, help your father get into bed.

595
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,592
Father.

596
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,094
Okay.

597
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,638
My son.

598
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,020
How's the stock price?

599
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,855
It's probably tanking.

600
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,276
I checked earlier,
and now I'm too scared to look again.

601
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,330
Did you bring it?

602
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,795
Once news of the chairman's dementia
gets out, Daesan stock will drop fast.

603
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:55,924
Then we'll buy up Daesan Energy shares
and increase our side's stake.

604
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,426
But if the stock drops too far,

605
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,930
- the group could collapse...
- Daesan's businesses are solid.

606
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,183
The stock will recover in time.

607
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,313
Ms. Ji, you married into the right family.

608
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:12,942
Give me the diagnosis.

609
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,620
I decided to become your friend
because I'm warm-hearted.

610
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,499
I'm not working with you
because you hold some great position.

611
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,169
You should know that.

612
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,131
I'll get it on my own. You can leave now.

613
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:36,883
Wait.

614
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,679
Here.

615
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:50,020
I haven't turned cold yet.

616
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,734
But when I do, I tend to be scary, Ms. Ji.

617
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,535
Honey, just have Father admitted.

618
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,830
Yeah, he'll need to stay
for a few days anyway.

619
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,290
Do you have the brain scan?

620
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,375
Yes.

621
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,924
He doesn't like

622
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,052
people talking about
test results behind his back.

623
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,138
I should know
my own condition better than anyone.

624
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,559
So don't you ever
keep these things from me.

625
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,102
How much worse has it gotten?

626
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,396
Neurology says

627
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,900
the prognosis isn't all that bad.

628
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,778
Right now,
it's your stress-induced gastritis.

629
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,364
Your condition isn't good.

630
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,742
It's a relief that my dementia
isn't progressing too fast.

631
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,288
No wonder my memory's been decent lately.

632
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,958
Right, Yeongsu?

633
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,921
Mom.

634
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,756
Father's talking.

635
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:00,924
Right...

636
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,885
Honey, should I cook some porridge?

637
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,012
Yes.

638
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,583
Hey.

639
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,168
Director Seo.

640
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,713
Help me up.

641
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,091
That way.

642
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,136
Come and sit.

643
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,762
Yes, sir.

644
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,776
As soon as you handed over
the murder evidence to prosecutors,

645
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,280
Mr. Yeom lost his mind.

646
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,490
No, Chairman.

647
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,076
This was all part of his plan.

648
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,414
He will probably start
buying up Daesan Energy stock now.

649
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,462
If all his allies combine their shares,
they'll become a powerful block.

650
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,674
How do we stop his attack?

651
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,635
I've been thinking...

652
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,474
{\an8}Maybe we should proceed
with a tender offer.

653
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:35,352
{\an8}To actively defend management control,
that might be the way to go...

654
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,064
{\an8}You and I were thinking the same thing.

655
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,859
If you approve, I'll use a tender offer
to block Mr. Yeom's attack.

656
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,613
Raising the funds won't be easy.

657
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,824
Director Seo.

658
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,370
Are you planning
to use your two trillion won?

659
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,081
I haven't decided

660
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,084
what to do with that money yet.

661
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,047
But I know some people
who want to invest in Daesan Energy.

662
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,342
Then go ahead.

663
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,593
Thank you, Chairman.

664
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,388
You should thank my son, Seonu.

665
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,932
When Yeom sent me into gastric pain,

666
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,227
it was my son who picked me up and ran.

667
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,147
Last time, Taeyun carried me too.

668
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,774
But being on your own son's back...

669
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,444
It's different
from being carried by your grandson.

670
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,073
The Huh family's back
and the Cha family's?

671
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,659
They're night and day.

672
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,039
Then I realized...

673
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,459
you were the one
who made all this possible.

674
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,879
That's why I called you in.

675
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,215
Yes, Chairman.

676
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,639
Who knows?

677
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,058
Maybe after I die,

678
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,521
you'll be the one to take Seonu down.

679
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,731
I'll never know.

680
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:08,612
All I can do while I'm alive
is beg you to do everything you can

681
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,115
to help Seonu.

682
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,332
Chairman Cha needs our money?

683
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,002
We're going forward with a tender offer.

684
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,919
You sure about this?

685
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,755
Didn't your father make you promise

686
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,216
to stay away
from the stock market when he died?

687
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,137
Well, I'll deal with my dad's will later.

688
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:36,140
What matters now
is not losing to Yeom Jangseon.

689
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,228
If we pool the funds
those CEOs were managing under my father,

690
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,314
we'll have a decent amount.

691
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,566
It's no surprise. It's money inherited

692
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,778
from Myeong Pyeongseok,
one of the top three names in finance.

693
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,822
Put everything I gave you

694
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,869
into the fund
for the Daesan Energy tender offer.

695
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,214
Chairman.

696
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,966
It's me, Choi Gihyeon.

697
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,055
The vice chairman of Daesan Group.

698
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,059
Chairman.

699
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,396
He seemed fine just now.

700
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,237
Did I get you?

701
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,034
You sure fooled me, Chairman.

702
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,412
Gosh.

703
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,249
What's the problem with the tender offer?

704
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,585
The timing, volume, and price
seemed perfect at first.

705
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,045
Turns out it's not so easy.

706
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,589
Yeom Jangseon's side
isn't backing down easily.

707
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:57,053
We may need short-term loans
in case we have to raise the price.

708
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,263
Mmm.

709
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:00,349
Okay, we should stay prepared.

710
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,520
We can't hand Yeom everything
we've worked for on a platter.

711
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,732
I'll have our investment bank check
on the National Pension Service's stance.

712
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,358
All right.

713
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,111
I've got something to look into,
so I'll head out now.

714
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,238
Sure.

715
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,115
Okay.

716
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,492
Director Seo, let's talk.

717
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,459
He seriously didn't recognize me just now.

718
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,461
He's been like that a lot lately.

719
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,381
It's upsetting.

720
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,400
Just now,

721
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,028
I actually didn't recognize him.

722
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,241
Yes, that's kind of what I figured.

723
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,660
Vice Chairman Choi

724
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:04,830
joined Daesan straight after college.

725
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,626
We've spent decades together.

726
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,839
Life is cruel.

727
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,885
How did I get here?

728
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:27,978
I'm heading in.

729
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,022
Let me drive you.

730
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,940
I've got a professional driver.

731
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,569
Why would I ride in your car? It's okay.

732
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,670
PROSECUTION SERVICE

733
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,138
It's fine. Don't follow me.

734
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,485
What brings you here?

735
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:18,778
Mmm.

736
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,656
I have something to take care of.

737
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,171
Wow.

738
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,341
It really is Chairman Cha Gangcheon.

739
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,594
He came to reveal the truth
behind his son-in-law Huh Ildo's death

740
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,472
before he lost his memory completely.

741
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,227
Who's going in?

742
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,612
Let's hurry to the next firm.

743
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,031
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Yeom Jangseon.

744
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,368
You've been charged
with ordering Huh Ildo's murder.

745
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,246
You're under arrest
due to risk of evidence tampering.

746
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,554
SEORIN HOSPITAL

747
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,770
Here.

748
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,023
What's wrong?

749
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,027
Right.

750
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,905
Are you looking down on it

751
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,615
since it's only 50,000 won?

752
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:46,699
Just drink it.

753
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,745
You'll get the expensive stuff
once you're back home.

754
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,455
Here.

755
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,540
Come on.

756
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,882
Arresting me without a warrant?

757
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,092
Cha Gangcheon, that crazy old man.

758
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,178
Cha Gangcheon?

759
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,387
You didn't know?

760
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,308
That senile old man walked
into the prosecutors' office himself,

761
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,477
saying he'd report you
before his memory fades.

762
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,147
And by pure chance... By pure luck,

763
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,360
one of the Elder's juniors found out
and stepped in.

764
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,362
People are watching.

765
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,156
We have to pretend to play fair.

766
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,244
Ungrateful bastard.
I built Daesan into what it is.

767
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:37,876
The arrest warrant was denied.
Go home and get some rest.

768
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,336
If you stay home,

769
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,172
you'll be investigated
without being detained.

770
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,632
The Elder arranged it.

771
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:45,717
What investigation?

772
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,388
Nam Sangcheol, go tell Lee Cheolyong...

773
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,057
from this moment on,
I'm not to be investigated.

774
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,142
Got it?

775
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,978
Okay.

776
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,063
Got it.

777
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:00,982
Have some.

778
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,067
Pour some more.

779
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,363
I thought you didn't like cheap wines.

780
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,831
You should've taken it easy. My goodness.

781
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,003
Hey, Nam Sangcheol...

782
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,505
Gosh, brother.

783
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,593
Do well, all right?

784
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,096
Go on in and get some rest.
Watch your head.

785
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,849
Take care, brother.

786
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,804
Seo Dongju, you bastard.

787
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,716
<i>It's been three days
since Yeom Jangseon,</i>

788
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,260
<i>a former Prosecutor General
now a professor</i>

789
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,471
<i>at Hanguk University Law School,
went missing.</i>

790
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:03,265
<i>Prosecutors believe
he was heavily involved</i>

791
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,727
<i>in the death
of former Daesan Energy CEO, Huh Ildo.</i>

792
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,230
<i>It's been a month
since Professor Yeom Jangseon</i>

793
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,440
<i>of Hanguk University Law School vanished.</i>

794
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:15,529
<i>There have been no signs of life
or activity from Professor Yeom.</i>

795
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:20,534
<i>Prosecutors have suspended
the indictment against Professor Yeom.</i>

796
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,455
Buried Hearts

797
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,208
{\an8}<i>Yeom Jangseon's disappearance,
was it your doing, Dongju?</i>

798
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,586
{\an8}<i>That his disappearance
isn't staged.</i>

799
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,088
{\an8}<i>Some say he may have been killed</i>

800
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,048
{\an8}since he had many enemies.

801
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:21,052
{\an8}I'm Seo Dongju,
the newly appointed CEO of Daesan Energy.

802
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,388
{\an8}<i>Is Mr. Yeom dead?</i>

803
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,806
{\an8}What if I killed him?

804
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,974
{\an8}Die, you bastard!

805
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,352
{\an8}<i>I'm going to take everything</i>...

806
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:33,273
{\an8}<i>Huh Ildo and Yeom Jangseon ever had,
down to the last piece.</i>

807
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,526
{\an8}<i>Did I win?</i>
