00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,080
Buried Hearts

00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,879
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,578
I was waiting to say I'm returning
to the chairman's office tomorrow.

5
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,128
There was no need to come
all the way to my room for that.

6
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,299
Actually, I need to tell you
something privately.

7
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,682
President Huh,

8
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,184
you attempted to kill me.

9
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,520
That makes you an attempted murderer.

10
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,481
From now on,

11
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,193
I'll be making good use of that weakness.

12
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,327
I was waiting to tell you that.

13
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,204
I'll see you at the office, then.

14
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,125
Director Seo…

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,380
When did your memory come back?

16
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,510
Did you even lose
your memory to begin with?

17
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,101
If I hadn't lost my memory,

18
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,859
why would I have jumped into the sea
to save the man who shot me?

19
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,821
Isn't that right, President Huh Ildo?

20
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,510
<i>President…</i>

21
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>Huh Ildo.</i>

22
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,205
He's not breathing.

23
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,549
Gosh, he's finally breathing again.

24
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,012
He's the one who shot me.

25
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,097
What?

26
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,851
If he shot you,
you should've just let him drown.

27
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,145
Why did you save him?

28
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,106
To get my revenge.

29
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,487
{\an8}EPISODE 10

30
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,908
{\an8}Chief.

31
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,041
{\an8}I'm calling a board meeting.

32
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,126
{\an8}A board meeting?

33
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,294
{\an8}Yes, Chief.

34
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,588
{\an8}To finalize your vice-chairman promotion.

35
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,773
CHAIRMAN CHA GANGCHEON

36
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,323
Darn.

37
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,795
Mr. Yeom.

38
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,505
What brings you here?

39
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,423
What do you mean?

40
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,555
I came to share good news,
Chairman.

41
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,102
<i>Are you having the stalled
crude oil import credit line approved?</i>

42
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,231
I put in a lot of effort, Chairman.

43
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,942
It wasn't easy to persuade The Elder.

44
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,738
I told him he can't neglect a partner
in this National Patriotism Project.

45
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,242
I pleaded The Elder, over and over again.

46
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,829
<i>After I was asked
by Director Seo,</i>

47
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,207
<i>I told Daesan Energy's partner bank</i>

48
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,252
<i>to ensure smooth support
for the oil import.</i>

49
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,090
<i>As Director Seo said, a partner
in the National Patriotism Project</i>

50
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,510
<i>should never have been neglected
in the first place.</i>

51
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,764
<i>If we keep this up,
who would trust us enough to work with us?</i>

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,559
<i>And, Jangseon,</i>

53
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,564
<i>from now on,
let Director Seo handle the money.</i>

54
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,528
Since you've solved
Daesan Energy's big issue,

55
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,280
we'll repay the favor.

56
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,199
Well, if that puts your mind at ease.

57
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,660
Anyway, gold's holding

58
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,496
more value than the dollar these days.

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,082
Director Seo,
wire it to the Swiss account.

60
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,960
- About the Swiss account...
- Right.

61
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,420
Yes, Mr. Yeom.

62
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:23,842
Director Seo will wire a generous amount
so you can save face before The Elder.

63
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,638
Yes. I'll wire it to the Swiss account
as soon as possible, sir.

64
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:35,228
Father, wouldn't it be better
to show your gratitude directly

65
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,105
to Mr. Yeom for his efforts?

66
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,189
Really?

67
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,942
Would you prefer that?

68
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
Mr. Yeom

69
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,073
values his dignity in front of The Elder
above all else, Chairman.

70
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,328
That's what they say.

71
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,497
I can't express

72
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,168
how glad I am
that Director Seo regained his memory.

73
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,754
Aren't you glad too, Mr. Yeom?

74
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,631
Yes, I'm very glad.

75
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,594
Now that Director Seo
can even read Mr. Yeom's mind,

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,970
isn't it reassuring?

77
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,767
Please keep guiding
and supporting my eldest son-in-law

78
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,728
so he can grow into a great person.

79
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,440
As for the long-vacant
Vice-Chairman position at Daesan Group…

80
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,698
I'm promoting Chief Secretary Choi Gihyeon
to lay the groundwork.

81
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,660
Once the time is right
and internal support grows,

82
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,664
I'll pass that position
on to President Huh Ildo.

83
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,931
Don't put anyone through.

84
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,140
Yes, sir.

85
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,525
Sir.

86
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,639
Huh Ildo,

87
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,435
I'll say this one more time.

88
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,065
Fill in every blank with no exceptions.

89
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,825
{\an8}HUH ILDO

90
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,102
That's enough!

91
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,027
Hey.

92
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,906
Help him up.

93
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,247
Get the hell out, you bastards!

94
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,050
Huh Ildo.

95
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:53,968
I'm sorry about this.

96
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,348
Let me apologize on their behalf.

97
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,350
Okay?

98
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,352
Goodness.

99
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,531
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART

100
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,291
Here.

101
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,151
President Huh.

102
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,779
Are you really not going to tell me?

103
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:03,955
All this happened because you couldn't
get rid of that rat, Seo Dongju.

104
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:09,460
Why did you attack the Administrator
when he tried to kill Seo Dongju?

105
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,422
I need to know why.

106
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,303
Did you start feeling sorry
for Seo Dongju when you got there?

107
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,346
Of course not. That's…

108
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,683
definitely not the case.

109
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,104
Taeyun was
in Director Seo's hospital room.

110
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,275
When I saw Taeyun
worrying about Director Seo there,

111
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,944
I made a mistake due to a misjudgment.

112
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,364
I won't make this mistake ever again.

113
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,661
You're too attached to your kid,
it's worrying me.

114
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,790
Being this sentimental…

115
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,878
How do you expect to handle bigger things?

116
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,265
I ended up making you bleed.

117
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,815
You know, when people get angry,
they lash out at the ones closest to them.

118
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,319
Back when you were a college student,

119
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,780
in the patriotic effort
to save this country…

120
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,701
From the moment you and I first met,

121
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,873
I've always valued you
more than my own family.

122
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,083
Don't forget that.

123
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,968
Come up with a plan

124
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,387
on how to deal with Seo Dongju.

125
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:53,273
PRESIDENT HUH ILDO

126
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,456
The two trillion won…

127
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,002
The Elder only intervened

128
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,046
for the National Patriotism Fund
that Director Seo controls.

129
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:22,051
If I take over Daesan Group
as we originally planned,

130
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,390
we will secure enough funds
to finance the National Patriotism Fund.

131
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,474
Then,

132
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,645
The Elder will have no reason
to stick with Director Seo.

133
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,071
Well, if that happens,

134
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,575
we'll be able to
take The Elder's involvement back.

135
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,666
But Seo Dongju will try to use Ji Seonu
to take control of Daesan Group.

136
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,684
Where were you last night?
You came home so late.

137
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,520
Mom.

138
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,565
The old man with
the iced vanilla latte and extra syrup.

139
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,568
He forgot where he lived.
I helped him find his way home.

140
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,946
Forgot where he lived?

141
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,991
Yeah. Oh, right.
He even called me his son.

142
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,663
He forgets his way home,
calls anyone his son,

143
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,373
and walks around barefoot.

144
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,876
I feel bad for the old man.

145
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,420
I'll be good to him next time he comes.

146
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,675
It must be the flour.

147
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,687
Seonu, still a lot left?

148
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,107
- No, it's the last load.
- Gosh, that was quick.

149
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,465
Is Mom here?

150
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,763
Ma'am! Hello.

151
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,897
My sneakers!

152
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,817
You said you didn't know our bakery.

153
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,653
I guess Dongju told you.

154
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,321
Did he try the cookies I baked?

155
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,204
Mom, can I get you something to drink?

156
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,206
She's leaving soon, Seonu.

157
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,041
Iced vanilla latte.

158
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,752
Should I add…

159
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,671
extra syrup to that?

160
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,382
You're having the same drink
as the old man.

161
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,186
As his daughter,

162
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,356
I should at least be aware
of what my father drinks when he's out.

163
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,194
If he ever falls ill,
it'll be a big problem.

164
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,364
Leave after your drink.

165
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,748
Hey.

166
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,336
It's up to me to end this conversation.

167
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,590
Unless you want your son to see this,
sit still.

168
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,221
Yeongsu.

169
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,183
Did you forget our deal?

170
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,520
You swore you'd never
even go near Daesan ever again.

171
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,772
How could I forget?

172
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,691
I swore on my life.

173
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,860
Because you've kept that promise,

174
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,613
you and your son are still alive.

175
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,743
Yeongsu.

176
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,746
If you

177
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,791
put your trust in Director Seo,

178
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:28,130
I will have you and your son
disappear without a trace.

179
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,799
Be careful.

180
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
Don't make your son show up
in front of my father again.

181
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,211
I heard you missed
the meal to celebrate my discharge

182
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,213
because you were feeling unwell.

183
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,965
Are you feeling better, Ms. Cha?

184
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,342
Director Seo,

185
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,928
don't waste your time.

186
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,265
Ji Seonu will never be part of our family.

187
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,435
Father's health is getting worse,

188
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,605
and all your efforts will go to waste.

189
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,107
That's why the chairman
entrusted this task to me.

190
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,151
To make sure it doesn't go down the drain.

191
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,111
It's our family's business.

192
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,282
We won't tolerate outsiders interfering.
Keep that in mind.

193
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,659
Or you'll regret it later.

194
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,744
Ms. Cha…

195
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,458
The matter with Seonu

196
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,460
is about Daesan Group.

197
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,005
I understand your concern
for Taeyun's future,

198
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,051
but handling this emotionally
as a family matter

199
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,095
could lead to irreversible consequences.

200
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,723
Is this a threat?

201
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,141
Did it sound like one?

202
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,225
Hey.

203
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,019
- Seo Dongju.
- Dongju!

204
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,615
- Dongju!
- Hey.

205
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,160
- Hey, man. Have you eaten?
- I have.

206
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,550
- Let's head in.
- Okay.

207
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,445
<i>I'm even thinking about marriage.</i>

208
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,243
To make Seonu become part of the family,

209
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,371
you've endured until he's old enough.

210
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,169
You opened this bakery here
so the chairman could come and go freely

211
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,881
to see Seonu whenever he wanted.

212
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,552
This is the worst kind of slander.

213
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,762
I did this to make a living with Seonu…

214
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,181
You can be honest with me, Ms. Ji.

215
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,271
Seonu joining Daesan Group…

216
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,649
won't be easy.

217
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:38,779
As his mother, you must stay by his father
as his legal wife.

218
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,669
So…

219
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,880
you're saying…

220
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,259
That's impossible.

221
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,017
But how can I

222
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,352
make that possible?

223
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,480
If you trust me and follow my lead,

224
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,566
I can make it possible.

225
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,614
If you agree with me,

226
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,616
I'll call Seonu here.

227
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,674
- <i>Yes, Dongju.</i>
- Hey, Seonu.

228
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,219
We need to talk. Come over here.

229
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,103
What is it?

230
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,252
NAMWON INSTRUMENT BASEMENT SHOPPING CENTER

♪ <i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i> ♪

236
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,250
I sent all the data
on Yeom Jangseon's properties

237
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,377
and everything from President Huh's phone

238
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,129
to that tablet.

239
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,467
I think we've found
almost all of the properties he hid

240
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,719
under different names.

241
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,220
Almost isn't enough.

242
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,348
Let's find all of them.

243
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,478
I should've grabbed coffee on the way.

244
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,982
Try this.

245
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,576
Mmm.

246
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,620
This wakes you up. It's great.

247
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,377
Find everyone connected
to Yeom Jangseon in any way,

248
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,546
especially those he locked up
when he was a prosecutor.

249
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,091
- Every one of them.
- Okay.

250
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,986
<i>Seong Hyeon!</i>

251
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,654
<i>Mom!</i>

252
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,420
Oh, that?

253
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,756
Linking the data
from President Huh's phone

254
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,091
must have sent this as well.

255
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,301
It's nothing important.

256
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,889
{\an8}After Huh Ildo's phone was taken,
his friend, Kang Seong, sent the photo.

257
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,350
<i>Do you remember this, Ildo?</i>

258
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:23,731
{\an8}<i>When I got my job at the tree farm,
you all came to congratulate me.</i>

259
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,482
<i>This is the photo we took then.</i>

260
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,069
<i>Me, Sunho, Gyeongwon, and you,</i>

261
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,155
<i>all in our prime.</i>

262
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,617
<i>Looking at this photo made me miss Sunho,</i>

263
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,245
<i>so I'll go and pour him a drink.</i>

264
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,956
There was nothing
on the Administrator's phone.

265
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,167
Calls, messages,

266
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,127
everything's been erased.

267
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,590
I expected it,
but he's more thorough than I thought.

268
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,385
He's probably used to managing
everything strictly by now.

269
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,262
However…

270
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,265
Cho Yangchun made a significant remark.

271
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,852
<i>Let's end this now.</i>

272
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,479
<i>Okay?</i>

273
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,523
<i>I really didn't know
who I was dealing with.</i>

274
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,694
<i>It was all Yeom Jangseon's orders.</i>

275
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:14,198
{\an8}<i>Aren't you curious about
what could finish off Yeom Jangseon?</i>

276
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,909
<i>If you let me out,</i>

277
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,286
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

278
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,084
<i>Dandelion…</i>

279
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,020
Ever heard…

280
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,773
of the Dandelion Team?

281
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,025
The Dandelion Team?

282
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,777
National Security Agency's secret unit.

283
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,487
<i>Chaebols,</i> the media, and lawmakers…

284
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,948
All the powerful
and influential people in Korea,

285
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,783
we surveilled them.

286
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,119
The Administrator is our boss.

287
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,870
But with the wave

288
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,873
of democratization
in the National Security Agency,

289
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,792
the Dandelion Team was suddenly disbanded.

290
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,044
And all their files vanished.

291
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,131
Where do you think they are now?

292
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,008
What does it have to do
with Yeom Jangseon?

293
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,885
Even Yeom Jangseon couldn't escape it.

294
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,221
He was a key surveillance target.

295
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,850
We didn't pledge loyalty to people.

296
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,603
From his corrupt dealings
to his everyday conversations,

297
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,189
we have recordings of everything.

298
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,359
That's why he's been desperately

299
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,112
searching for them since then.

300
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,282
<i>Ma Jaeyeol,
a journalist, came to ask</i>

301
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,077
if you've ever been blackmailed
with the NSA's Dandelion Team files.

302
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,914
That means
even these journalists know about them.

303
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,085
Chairman, were you aware
such files existed?

304
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,504
Mr. Yeom warned me about them before.

305
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,800
He said there were such dangerous files,
but he couldn't destroy the original.

306
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,221
And that if anyone used it for blackmail,
I should let him know immediately.

307
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,477
How can I believe you?

308
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,571
Ask the Administrator

309
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,699
or Yeom Jangseon about it.

310
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,093
Let's shake up
Cho Yangchun and the Administrator

311
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,262
to uncover Yeom Jangseon's weak spot.

312
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,515
Let's secure
the Dandelion files ourselves.

313
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,809
Okay.

314
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,981
A good beating
and some hunger did the trick.

315
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,985
Cho Yangchun spilled everything.
I was shocked. Wow.

316
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,098
LET'S MAKE A TRADE,
THE DANDELION FILES FOR CHO YANGCHUN

317
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,649
Aren't you going to reply?

318
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,990
You had to make me come looking for you.

319
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,620
Dandelion?

320
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,455
That never existed.

321
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,666
It's just rumors.

322
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,712
Cho Yangchun has been
desperately waiting for you.

323
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,755
Is he useless to you now?

324
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,843
Oh Jungho, former National Security Agency
Team Dandelion's leader.

325
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,560
Put me on the phone with Yangchun.

326
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,357
- Ilnam.
- Yeah.

327
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,360
Use the burner phone to connect
Cho Yangchun and the Administrator.

328
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,529
He took the bait.

329
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,907
But do you think
the Administrator will act as expected?

330
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,077
Let's try planting doubt in his head.

331
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,332
How I found about the Dandelion files
and how much Cho Yangchun's spilled…

332
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,878
Those small doubts will tear them apart.

333
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,796
That's true.

334
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,673
Seong Hyeon… I mean, Dongju.

335
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,426
Ever since you went to Q Salon
with that ripped suit

336
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,011
to look for its owner,

337
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,764
have your predictions
ever been wrong? Never.

338
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,142
Except maybe that The Elder
took longer than expected to meet you.

339
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,769
One more thing.

340
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,020
The cinnamon attack.

341
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,147
And Sister Agnes…

342
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,363
Because The Elder took so long to react,

343
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,158
you had a lot of close calls with death.

344
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,702
You held out and held out again,
until now.

345
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,622
It's impressive.

346
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,209
If it weren't for you and Taegeum,
I'd be dead already.

347
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,418
Gosh.

348
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,378
Don't mention it.

349
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,090
Well, then, I'll go fishing now.

350
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,760
Thank you.

351
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,844
Of course.

352
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,342
CHEON GUHO

353
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,475
Sir.

354
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,187
While the Administrator secured
the Dandelion files, Seo Dongju caught on.

355
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,193
Since Seo Dongju
might be scheming behind the scenes,

356
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,820
go check it yourself.

357
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,655
Yes, sir.

358
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,460
Hey! Get up!

359
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,673
Your boss wants to talk to you.

360
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,799
Goodness.

361
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,384
Here.

362
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:56,224
I'll let you talk to your boss,
so choose your words wisely. Got it?

363
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,609
<i>Boss!</i>

364
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,319
<i>It's me, Yangchun.</i>

365
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,905
Yangchun, are you okay?

366
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,365
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

367
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,450
<i>Well…</i>

368
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,745
You haven't given up on me, right?

369
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,706
You're coming to get me, right?

370
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,250
I will. Hang in there a little longer.

371
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,668
Then I'll get Seo Dongju…

372
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,968
When are you bringing the Dandelion files?

373
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,056
That's right.

374
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,557
Yes, right.

375
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,477
He said he only heard
about them through rumors.

376
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,896
He promised to find and send them ASAP.

377
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,147
We must get the files

378
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,442
before he changes his mind
and gives them to Yeom Jangseon.

379
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,526
<i>Yes, we should.</i>

380
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,197
But why is Yeom Jangseon
so desperate to find the Dandelion files?

381
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,531
Because there was a time

382
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,326
when he was a high-ranking official
under surveillance.

383
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,413
Yeom Jangseon must have a lot to hide.

384
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,470
Here's the location
of the phone from the call.

385
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,359
Is this all?

386
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,444
Once my safety is guaranteed,

387
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,114
I'll hand over the rest.

388
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,868
So you're saying Mr. Cho
might have leaked Dandelion to Seo Dongju?

389
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,872
Let's take care of Mr. Cho first.

390
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,126
After that,
we'll make sure you're protected.

00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,214
Excuse me.

398
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,258
Damn it!

399
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,637
It's okay.

400
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,847
Sleep tight.

401
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,720
Who are you?

402
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:02,887
Who is that?

403
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,764
- Yangchun!
- Yes, boss!

404
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,641
I'm over here!

405
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,268
Please untie this for me.

406
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,457
Hey, you bastard!

407
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,542
Did you really come here to kill me?

408
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,045
Darn it!

409
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,381
Seo Dongju was right, darn it!

410
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,553
Tell me where the Dandelion files are.

411
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,058
If you tell me, I'll let you live.

412
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,603
Yangchun!

413
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,564
You think they'll let you live
if you do this?

414
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,816
You bastard!

415
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,156
What are you doing?

416
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,784
What the hell are you doing?
That's not what you said!

417
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:06,951
I changed my mind.

418
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,329
Stop fighting

419
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,707
and figure out together
how you can bring me

420
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,751
the Dandelion files.

421
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,212
Seo Dongju!

422
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,715
Haven't we met once before,
a long time ago?

423
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,556
I know about your father very well.

424
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,782
You should go to the hospital.

425
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,700
Your fever's worse than before.

426
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,205
You're the one who should go.

427
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,623
It's just a scratch.

428
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,166
It's already healed.

429
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,298
I'm more worried about Taeyun than myself.

430
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,301
He hasn't been eating well lately.

431
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,595
He says he's not sick, but…

432
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,726
No, the biggest concern is…

433
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,771
Seo Dongju.

434
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,731
Seo Dongju…

435
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,781
Why did you still save me
after recognizing me in the water?

436
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,117
You'll learn…

437
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,786
the reason soon enough,

438
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,582
and it'll hurt down to your bones.

439
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,298
Today's breakfast is supposedly
to celebrate my discharge.

440
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,510
After your workout,
please join us in time.

441
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,893
Dad, Dongju's woken up!

442
00:39:58,897 --> 00:39:59,939
Dongju…

443
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,920
KANG SEONG

444
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,886
It's Kang Seong.

445
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,722
He's calling me
since you aren't reachable.

446
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,436
Yes, Seong. It's me.

447
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,813
Yes, okay.

448
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,777
Actually, I lost my phone.

449
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,154
Yes.

450
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,824
A photo?

451
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,576
No, I didn't receive it.

452
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,956
Yes, okay.

453
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,999
Okay, I'll see you.

454
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,753
He says hello to you.

00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,097

That photo…

459
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,221
On that day…

460
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,684
I took it.

461
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,651
Let me see.

462
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,406
Wow. Deokhui,
you're great at taking pictures.

463
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,242
Have a look.

464
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,493
Isn't it a great photo?

465
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,578
- Yes.
- Wow.

466
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,038
I want to keep that photo.

467
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,706
What? I want to keep it too.

468
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,666
What should we do?

469
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,752
Okay, I'll give it to you.

470
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,879
Here.

471
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,339
Deokhui, let's take one more photo.

472
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,799
- Come here.
- Yes.

473
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,342
Honey, join us.

474
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,053
I'm okay.

475
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,222
Let's take one first,
and Deokhui can join us after.

476
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,808
Just like we did earlier, Mom.

477
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:41,976
What?

478
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,020
Let's do that.

479
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,104
Sure.

480
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,607
Now.

481
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,374
My goodness, you're heavy.
You're so heavy.

482
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,252
- You ate a lot.
- Why did you have so much delicious food?

483
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,545
Huh?

484
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,005
Let's see.

485
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,134

00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,507
Congrats.

490
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,135
Thanks.

491
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,636
Cheese.

492
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,138
- I'll take the photo.
- Sure.

493
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,266
One, two, three.

494
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,978
Yes, thank you.

00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,147
Thank you.

497
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,818
Yeonju.

498
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,070
Now that I'm a director,

499
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,157
how about we visit Father together?

500
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,993
Father? Who?

501
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,162
Professor Lee Supyung, who left us.

502
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,376
Why are you so shocked?

503
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,673
I saw you smiling while looking at photos
on his university's website.

504
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,053
I'd like to meet him.

505
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,848
I…

506
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,017
Don't want to meet him, Dongju.

507
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,730
It took me a long time to erase
the resentment and hatred I had for him.

508
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,814
So,

509
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,735
think of him as someone unrelated to you

510
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,196
and erase him from your heart.

511
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:23,638
Hello, Professor.

512
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,766
I'm not Professor Lee Supyung.

513
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,144
He's on sabbatical and now overseas.

514
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,104
I came to water his plants.

515
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
We've…

516
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,031
met before, right?

517
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,786
Yes, we met at
Prosecutor Yeom Huicheol's wedding.

518
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:53,042
We also met at the principal's office
of Gangshin High School.

519
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,838
I didn't think you'd remember that.

520
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,593
I wasn't sure at the wedding,
but it came to me later.

521
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,723
Back then, my older brother

522
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,143
shouldn't have interfered
with Huicheol's rugby team.

523
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,857
Then, you and Huicheol
would've gotten along well.

524
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,990
If you have anything to tell
Professor Lee Supyung, let me know.

525
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,074
I'll pass it on to him.

526
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,910
Seo Yeonju…

527
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,122
Please tell him
she passed away in an accident.

528
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,629
I heard that Supyung

529
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,424
received the news about Sister Agnes.

530
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,219
He received the news?

531
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,389
How?

532
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,932
Since the convent knew

533
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,685
Supyung was her biological father,

534
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,228
they must have contacted him.

535
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,733
I see.

536
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,235
I didn't know, so I came here.

537
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,113
My sister missed our father dearly.

538
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:09,243
I came thinking our father should know
that my sister is no longer here.

539
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,913
And…

540
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,127
I've wanted to meet
my father at least once.

541
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,606

CEO OFFICE

543
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,870
CEO PI JEONGHUI

544
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,457
<i>Since you wanted the truth…</i>

545
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,043
You're…

546
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,589
not Supyung's son.

547
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:51,971
Madame Pi.

548
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,017
Were you aware
that I'm not blood-related to my sister?

549
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,729
Dongju…

550
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,151
you ate a double portion
of <i>jajangmyeon</i> just fine,

551
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,737
so why are you saying
weird stuff like that?

552
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,323
Well…

553
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,118
If I ever…

554
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,205
got to meet Professor Lee Supyung,

555
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,624
I wanted to impress him.

556
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,377
So I went into business school
to follow suit.

557
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,797
"Like father, like son.
You can't fool blood."

558
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,632
I wanted to hear that, I guess.

559
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,721
But turns out he's not my father.

560
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,306
Dongju…

561
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,600
I'm not Professor Lee's son,

562
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,811
and I'm not my mother's son.

563
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,730
Not your mother's son? Then what…

564
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,815
What are you talking about?

565
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,860
Who said that?

566
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,029
Seriously, who said that?

567
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,155
My mother did.

568
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,532
My mother, Ko Youjin.

569
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,872
<i>So,</i>

570
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,540
after breaking up with Supyung,

571
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,876
a few years later,

572
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,670
Ko Youjin came looking for him,
asking for help.

573
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,217
She adopted a son
so her daughter wouldn't grow up alone,

574
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,969
but she was struggling financially.

575
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,266
Before Yeonju joined the convent,
she visited Professor Lee.

576
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,229
I really wanted to go too,

577
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,022
but I held back.

578
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,946
When I heard
I'd become a national rugby player,

579
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,950
when I passed the GED
and got into business school,

580
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,036
when I joined Daesan Group

581
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,664
and got promoted to director…

582
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,957
During all those times,

583
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,877
I missed my father.

584
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,713
A whole lot too.

585
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,511
If I meet him,
I'll ask why he abandoned us.

586
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,764
After unloading everything…

587
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:03,978
After that,

588
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,481
I'll ask if I can visit sometimes.

589
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:10,985
If he says yes,

590
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,279
I'd go see him now and then,

591
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,282
and greet him like, "Father, I'm here."

592
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,326
That's what I wanted.

593
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,960
You knew from the start, right?

594
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,887
Then, where on earth did Mom pick me up?

595
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,265
She didn't.

596
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,309
You came.

597
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,562
To Yeonju and her mom.

598
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,106
They said you walked in.

599
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,150
You're lying again.

600
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,443
I'm being serious.

601
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,612
You…

602
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,823
You walked into Yeonju's house.

603
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,580
I have something to show you.

604
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,356
Open it.

605
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,165
What's this?
Why did you even put this in a safe?

606
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:53,462
When you walked into Yeonju's house,
you were wearing these clothes.

607
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,882
She left it with me
before joining the convent.

608
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,387
Wow, the Daesan badge.

609
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,847
I remember this.

610
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,683
I wore it every day.

611
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,393
I think

612
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:13,065
this is why I kept this tin
in the safe, Dongju.

613
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,450
Is this me?

614
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,912
Yes, it's you.

615
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,039
How do you know if it's me?

616
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,165
I may

617
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,751
not have breastfed you,

618
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,461
but I bathed and fed you.

619
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,173
Your mom raised you,
and half of that is thanks to me.

620
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,010
If I say it's you,
you've got to take my word for it.

621
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,065
It's the same photo.

622
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,067
Dongju.

623
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,406
The person carrying you
must be your father.

624
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,575
Right?

625
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:21,967
Sir.

626
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,845
Calling an old man like me out

627
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,348
at this ungodly hour

628
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,225
could seriously hurt

629
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,936
my chances of a long life.

630
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,231
Jangseon.

631
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,150
Yes, brother.

632
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,903
Why are you messing
with my hometown cousin's son?

633
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,197
It seemed like

634
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,910
my very selfish brother
had forgotten what I do,

635
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,454
so I'd raise a bit of a fuss
on the outskirts.

636
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,874
Call off the investigation, now.

637
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,793
You should've said that earlier.

638
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,048
Too late now. It's already on the news…

639
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,846
<i>Lee Jeongtae,
known as President Lee Cheolyong's nephew,</i>

640
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,141
<i>allegedly embezzled
government water resource research funds,</i>

641
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,143
<i>according to an internal whistleblower.</i>

642
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,978
<i>The prosecution is investigating.</i>

643
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,819
You know I'm not in a position
to call off this investigation.

644
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,530
So you tell them to stop, Jangseon!

645
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:27,991
How can you be so out of touch?

646
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,161
If we stop the investigation,
people will get suspicious.

647
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,541
I told you, it's just a bit
of a fuss on the outskirts.

648
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:36,959
Now that I have

649
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,003
reminded you what I'm capable of…

650
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,674
"Nothing serious has been found
after investigation."

651
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,426
I'll have it end with that conclusion.

652
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,776
Yes.

653
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,239
Really?

654
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,867
Well, that's not a bad idea.

655
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,371
That's true.

656
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,832
Yes, you're right.

657
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,040
Why are you up so early?

658
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,916
I didn't sleep.

659
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,590
Well…

660
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,051
The other day,

661
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,721
you packed and left, then came back.

662
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:18,101
Did my begging
get through to you a little?

663
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,525
Tell me the truth.

664
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,446
If I ask for a divorce,

665
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,368
I'd have to pay a penalty
way more than the stocks

666
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,953
I got from this marriage.

667
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,669
That's why you came back.

668
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,464
I'm sorry.

669
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,260
That money…

670
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,307
I'll prepare it for you.

671
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,652
I packed some of your clothes.

672
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,905
Leave this house right now.
I'll send the rest later.

673
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,366
- Huicheol.
- I'm kicking you out.

674
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,911
I'm asking for a divorce,
so no penalty needed.

675
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,330
I'll file the papers today.

676
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,915
We don't even have kids,

677
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,793
so it won't take long.

678
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,839
I'll let my aunt and uncle know.

679
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,681
You were going to divorce me…

680
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,603
and go to that bastard, right?

681
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,160
I'm going to shower.

682
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,706
I'd like you to be gone when I'm done.

683
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,636
Eunnam.

684
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,096
I'm getting a divorce.

685
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,981
What were you staring at so hard?
You didn't even notice me coming.

686
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,359
Well…

687
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,570
I told you before

688
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,365
about the professor
who ditched me and my sister.

689
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,160
- That professor...
- Where did you get this photo?

690
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,831
Do you know him?

691
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,124
Yes.

692
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,126
That's my dad.

693
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,784
Buried Hearts

694
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:48,622
{\an8}Please keep it a secret until the end
that the child named Seong Hyeon is me.

695
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,498
{\an8}<i>Give up Eunnam.</i>

696
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:54,920
{\an8}<i>The kid's mother and my dad.
Huh Ildo killed them all.</i>

697
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,840
{\an8}Director Seo will help you, so start
learning the ropes of the company.

698
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,468
{\an8}<i>She will be your solid ally.</i>

699
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,430
{\an8}<i>I'm about to introduce someone
who's like a gift to you.</i>

700
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,558
{\an8}What the elders of Daesan Group did to me.

701
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:12,020
{\an8}<i>You thought Seong Hyeon was dead,
but he showed up alive as Seo Dongju.</i>

702
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,688
Do you still wish for him to die?

703
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,774
It's almost a shame to kill him.
