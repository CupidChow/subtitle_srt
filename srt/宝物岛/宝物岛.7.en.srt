{\an8}LET ETERNAL LIGHT SHINE UPON HER
SEO YEONJU AGNES

6
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,032
Thank you.

7
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,275
How...

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,737
How could this happen?

9
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,322
Thank you for coming.

10
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:58,076
I won't let the bastard
who did this to your sister walk free.

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,078
That truck driver.

12
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,747
Once he's out of the hospital,

13
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,876
he must be arrested
and locked up immediately.

14
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,462
It's the least we can do

15
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,715
to let Sister Agnes rest in peace.

16
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,691
Stay back, step away!

17
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,151
Move back, it's dangerous!

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,236
Go with her.

19
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,832
Hold on.

20
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,918
Ouch.

21
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,756
Dongju!

22
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,258
Dongju!

23
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,636
Dongju!

24
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,730
You...

25
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,609
You really don't recognize me.

26
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,986
I refused to believe you had amnesia

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,948
when Sister Agnes told me.

28
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,955
I can't believe this happened.
I'm so sorry.

29
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,923
<i>She's Madame Pi, the guardian
of Director Seo and his sister</i>

30
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
<i>when they were young.</i>

31
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,600
Come on now,

32
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,978
how could he just stand by as a senior

33
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,481
while his juniors were getting beaten up?

34
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,650
Is that what they teach
in Gangshin's rugby team?

35
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,570
Gangshin High School's
rugby team

36
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,781
had never had incidents like this
before Seo Dongju joined.

37
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,325
I'm sorry, Principal.

38
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,995
I came to Gangshin to play rugby.

39
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,580
Please, let me keep playing.

40
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,874
Expulsion is unfair.

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,878
Yeom Huicheol ruthlessly beat up
the younger students first,

42
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,714
and when Dongju tried to stop him,
he hurt his head.

43
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,968
That's what the witnesses said, Principal.

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,059
Oh. It's you.

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,897
You said Dongju got dragged into this
while trying to protect you guys.

46
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,900
Now, tell the principal that again.

47
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,985
- Okay?
- Well...

48
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,697
At the principal's request,
we conducted a thorough investigation.

49
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,534
We spoke to all of them
and got their statements.

50
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,620
Yes, hand it to me.

51
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,587
STATEMENT

52
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,049
What in the world are you doing?

53
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,344
Hey, Yeom Huicheol.

54
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,261
Tell the truth.

55
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,681
You started that fight
just to screw me over.

56
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,725
What the heck? Hey.

57
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,977
Hey, you thug.

58
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,812
Why would I do that?

59
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,731
Because I'm better than you at rugby.

60
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,983
You're never better than me.

61
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,319
What did you say?

62
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,657
Open your eyes, you coward.

63
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,747
Pathetic.

64
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,665
Madame Pi.

65
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,667
- Yes, Dongju.
- Let's go.

66
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,752
Dongju!

67
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,004
You can't leave like this.

68
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,841
You need to beg them
to revoke your expulsion.

69
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,427
They stabbed me
in the back. How can I play with them?

70
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,316
Dad.

71
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,653
- Hello.
- Yes.

72
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,904
You were abroad for a conference.

73
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,783
Yes, I canceled the rest of my schedule.

74
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,910
I'm sorry I'm late when it's about my son.

75
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,830
- It's fine.
- Sir.

76
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,333
You paid off the rugby parents,
didn't you?

77
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,334
To frame me.

78
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,504
Seo Dongju! Shut your mouth!

79
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,547
Who taught you to speak like that?

80
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,923
Show some respect!

81
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,134
So it's true.

82
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,511
I was just throwing it out there.

83
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,430
- Madame Pi.
- Yes.

84
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,933
Dongju, since Huicheol's father is here...

85
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,146
You said it yourself
that guilty ones get mad first.

86
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,897
Look carefully.

87
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,441
Who's the one getting mad?

88
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,445
That little...

89
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,530
Dongju!

90
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,365
Dongju!

91
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,998
- Brother!
- Professor Yeom.

92
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,376
Why did you cancel
your conference for this?

93
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,755
As his uncle,
I can protect Huicheol myself.

94
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,591
Jeez.

95
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,802
{\an8}8 YEARS AGO

96
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,806
Is this the guy who messed with
Daesan Energy's accounting records?

97
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,892
Yes.

98
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,188
He's got a face
that rubs me the wrong way.

99
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,398
- Was this from high school?
- Yes.

100
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,400
To Seo Dongju's left
is his sister, Seo Yeonju,

101
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,570
and to his right is his guardian,
Madame Pi.

102
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,328
Guho, where did you find this photo?

103
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,791
Seo Dongju posted this photo
the day he got into Daesan Group.

104
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,876
"A bold first step, like a charging boar."

105
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,587
That was his caption.

106
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,799
How did a nobody
and the great Yeom Jangseon

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,593
get tangled up like this?

108
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,762
Damn it.

109
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,557
Goodness. Life's a real piece of work.

110
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,771
I've got more pictures of him.

111
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,607
Forget it. Dig deeper into this guy.

112
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,444
I once stripped this guy
of his rugby uniform.

113
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,116
Now he's coming at me,
asking to be stripped of his suit.

114
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,368
Like a wild boar.

115
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,206
Yeonju!

116
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,388
Yeonju!

117
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,287
Before Yeonju became a nun,

118
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,457
she looked after you like a mother.

119
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,755
Your mother entrusted you both to me
before she passed.

120
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,133
We've spent all these years together.

121
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,885
Do you really...

122
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,346
not remember anything about me?

123
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,102
When you were little,
you'd call me, "Madame Pi."

124
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,354
"Madame Pi."

125
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,982
You followed me around calling me that.

126
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,862
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,284
Well...

128
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,203
When you were at school,

129
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,956
you used to beat up
a punching bag every day.

130
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,167
You don't remember that either?

131
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,127
That punching bag...

132
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,505
I hung that up for you.

133
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,343
Pounding that every day
gave you strong fists.

134
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,975
What am I going to do with you?

135
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,729
What am I going to do?

136
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,066
What do I do?

137
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,655
Sir,

138
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,740
I have a favor to ask you.

139
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,911
I think I should take her
somewhere she can calm down.

140
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,372
Of course, Director Seo.

141
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,249
While I'm gone,

142
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,335
could you receive the guests in my place?

143
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,294
What?

144
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,756
You're the only one
I can ask for this favor.

145
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,924
I'd appreciate it.

146
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,009
Wait...

147
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,225
Director Seo.

148
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,645
Well...

149
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,552
How could Yeonju pass away,

150
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,889
leaving you all alone,

151
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,308
when you lost your memory...

152
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,646
How could she pass away like that?

153
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,039
Gosh...

154
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,177
<i>Seo Dongju.</i>

155
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,224
<i>Your sister died because of you.
You'd better be worth it.</i>

156
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,934
<i>After all this mess,</i>

157
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,146
<i>how is it that the two trillion won
stuck in your thick skull</i>

158
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,608
<i>still hasn't come back to you?</i>

159
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,694
<i>Does that make any sense?</i>

160
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,208
Dongju,

161
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,878
don't worry about the guests,

162
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,880
and get some sleep.

163
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,176
I'll wake you up for the funeral mass.

164
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,748
KYUNGUI UNIVERSITY
KEUNSOL CENTRAL HOSPITAL

165
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,755
Is it night training today?

166
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,508
{\an8}- Yes.
- Hang in there.

167
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,968
{\an8}- See you.
- Thank you.

168
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,886
{\an8}- Who is that?
- Do you know him?

169
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,307
Patient Cho Yangchun
needs to receive treatment.

170
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,394
Okay.

171
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,981
Thank you.

172
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,859
Take care.

173
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,076
You have a message from Mr. Yeom.

174
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,287
Eyes forward.

175
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,914
The plan has changed.

176
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,722
My phone.

177
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,059
I'll grab it and follow you.

178
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,991
Did Mr. Yeom say
I don't have to go to prison?

179
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,330
Let's go. Where am I supposed to go?

180
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,300
Shoot!

181
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,595
Darn it!

182
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,891
You bastard!

183
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,321
Hey.

184
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,074
Cho Yangchun will be discharged
and arrested. You can go.

185
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,703
Actually, he just left for treatment.

186
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,413
- He's being discharged. What treatment?
- What?

187
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,665
Damn it!

188
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,502
Someone I knew was in an accident.

189
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,130
Yes, that's right.

190
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,923
- Dad!
- Yes.

191
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,008
What? Hey.

192
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,675
Ihyeon.

193
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,927
What brings you here?

194
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,430
I came for Mass.
A nun I knew has passed away.

195
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,807
For this church and its kindergarten,

196
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,311
I planted all the trees
in the playground with her.

197
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,562
What about you?

198
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,941
The nun's younger brother...

199
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,150
is the one you met last time.

200
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,236
The guy who came to our place?

201
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,738
- Really?
- Yes.

202
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,447
Hey.

203
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,283
Hey, Dr. Kang.

204
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,328
Hi.

205
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,250
- Let's go.
- Sure.

206
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,100
Sir.

207
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,141
You tied him up nice and tight.

208
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,020
Wow, he's completely wrecked.

209
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,858
Shall we get going now?

210
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,538
<i>Guho,
Madame Pi is going that way.</i>

211
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,416
<i>Manager Cho
escaped from the hospital.</i>

212
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,684
Sir, please watch your words.

213
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,143
Yangchun would never do that.

214
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,270
I didn't raise him that way.

215
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,524
He slipped out of the cuffs and ran.

216
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,150
Did you help him escape?

217
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,277
Sir.

218
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,238
If he was running away,

219
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,699
would he have left his phone behind?

220
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,993
<i>I called because
I was worried about his injuries,</i>

221
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>but the police picked up instead.</i>

222
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,916
Hold on.

223
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,087
The nurse pushed him out.

224
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:17,007
It looks like Jang Ilnam,
who vanished with Dongju in Namhae.

225
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,221
Then that guy in the helmet...

226
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,222
is Seo Dongju?

227
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,306
It can't be him.

228
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,226
I saw that he went into the room...

229
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,685
We will now begin
Sister Agnes' funeral mass.

230
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,439
Please rise from your seats.

231
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,776
Please turn toward the church entrance.

232
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:21,280
We will now sing hymn 227.

233
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:40,924
<i>♪ I am the life ♪</i>

234
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:46,095
<i>♪ All who thirst ♪</i>

235
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:51,185
<i>♪ Come to me ♪</i>

236
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,724
Guho.

237
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,312
That bastard got his memory back
and is putting on a show, right?

238
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,317
Forget the two trillion won.

239
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,114
If I don't take down Seo Dongju now,
I won't be able to breathe.

240
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,869
<i>♪ Take this soul ♪</i>

241
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,457
<i>♪ Into your hands ♪</i>

242
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:42,755
<i>♪ Angels ♪</i>

243
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,673
Over there...

244
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,426
Is the woman next to Director Seo
his sister?

245
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,012
His sister...

246
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,222
is at the front.

247
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,142
Then...

248
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,978
it must be his mother.

249
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,232
Dongju grew up without a mother.

250
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,280
Lord, grant Agnes eternal rest.

251
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,284
May Agnes
and all who have departed this world

252
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,245
find peace in God's mercy.

253
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,414
Amen.

254
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,543
Please be seated.

255
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,836
To conclude,

256
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,424
we will now sing the hymn
"Grant Them Eternal Rest."

257
00:24:58,831 --> 00:24:59,831
Could it be that

258
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,168
Director Seo's memory returned
from the shock of his sister's death?

259
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,841
Then you have...

260
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,510
failed.

261
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,472
Failed in what?

262
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,686
Depending on how I take it,
that could be very offensive.

263
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,403
If Seo Dongju got his memory back,

264
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,115
he would've gone straight
to the one who shot him first.

265
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,351
I already explained everything
over the phone.

266
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,772
Why did you suddenly ask for a meeting?

267
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,408
I told you, I'll take care of
the candidates the other party is after.

268
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,953
I'll shut them up completely.

269
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,835
Why did you insist on seeing me in person?

270
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,425
Surprise!

271
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,056
Brother.

272
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,141
Did you get scared?

273
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,395
This is hilarious.

274
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,149
The Elder said...

275
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:54,655
"Senior Assemblyman
Nam Sangcheol of the ruling party,

276
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,157
you go and settle things

277
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,953
with Yeom Jangseon on my behalf."

278
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:06,125
That's why I'm here.

279
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,460
Oh, yes!

280
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,170
I was told to get

281
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,798
a clear answer on one thing.

282
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,138
Why isn't the money
gushing out like it should?

283
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:25,727
Instead, it's trickling out
like a bad bladder infection.

284
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,441
Considering your age...

285
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,911
Scared?

286
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:48,083
Tell the Elder
that I've got everything under control.

287
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,421
He wants control of the funds.

288
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,756
Not me! The Elder!

289
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,259
The Elder is asking for it.

290
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:58,927
The Elder!

291
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:01,972
The Elder...

292
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,438
Jeez.

293
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,441
Darn it, did I mess around too much?

294
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,528
You're asking what the big deal is?

295
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,072
All hell broke loose.

296
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,199
Anyway, we need to meet now.

297
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,292
How about Seo Dongju?

298
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,087
Aside from visiting Madame Pi
to ask about the past, it's the same.

299
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,551
Sir, it seems Director Seo is trying hard
to recover his memories.

300
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,846
How pointless. Does he think that'll work?

301
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,098
I'll wring his neck

302
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,892
and toss him back into the sea.

303
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,729
A two-trillion-won feast for the fishes.

304
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,296
Yes, sir.

305
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,215
I looked

306
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,845
Yeom Jangseon straight in the eye
and told him.

307
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,474
I said, "Hand over
the funds management immediately."

308
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,479
SAFETY FIRST

309
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,250
The person Yeom Jangseon met...

310
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,045
It wasn't the Elder.

311
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,755
What?

312
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,175
What do you mean?

313
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,178
Sell off Daesan Energy?

314
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,556
I told you,

315
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:54,810
on the condition that Director Seo

316
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,188
never regains his memory, remember?

317
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,608
Not even the death of his sister
could bring back his memory!

318
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,693
That's...

319
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,278
not for sure.

320
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,657
The truck driver who caused the accident
vanished without a trace.

321
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,203
It's Seo Dongju's doing.

322
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:18,460
Anyway, at Sister Agnes' funeral,
Chairman Cha didn't seem mentally sound.

323
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,046
Why didn't you report
such an important matter to me?

324
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,131
I only found out...

325
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,759
that day.

326
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,763
You must stay sharp.

327
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,392
If Chairman Cha has dementia, that means
our opportunity is coming even sooner.

328
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,021
You and I have spent years
building Daesan as our golden ticket.

329
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,567
But one wrong move
and it's going straight to the dogs.

330
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,449
ADMINISTRATOR

331
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,748
ADMINISTRATOR

332
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,378
Yes.

333
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,798
Mr. Yeom isn't answering my calls.

334
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,428
He's with his guest.

335
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,264
Ask him for me.

336
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,183
Has he forgotten about Cho Yangchun?

337
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,060
If he has,

338
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,772
I'll go find him myself.

339
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,667
YEO EUNNAM

340
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,679
<i>The number you dialed
cannot be reached...</i>

341
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,607
<i>You won't
answer my calls or see me.</i>

342
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,651
<i>I'm really worried, Dongju.</i>

343
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,559
Secretary Gong,
I'm unable to take long baths anymore.

344
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,650
You took a short bath today.

345
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,735
I'm feeling off.

346
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,738
Even taking baths takes stamina.

347
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,658
The eggs will make you
feel better, Chairman.

348
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,327
About the kid named Seong Hyeon...

349
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,665
Didn't you hear me?

350
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,334
The kid named Seong Hyeon,

351
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,086
don't you remember?

352
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,171
Are you talking about Director Seo?

353
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,216
Gosh, no.

354
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,178
You know, the little boy this tall
who was pretty like a girl...

355
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,724
A long time ago, Eunnam's father,
Yeo Sunho, brought him here.

356
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,184
I'm not sure who you mean.

357
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,520
Do you have dementia?

358
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,320
Hmm.

359
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,345
Director Seo...

360
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,890
You...

361
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,685
Has your memory come back?

362
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,317
Thanks.

363
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,735
No problem.

364
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,987
- I'll get going.
- Take care.

365
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:01,910
Wow.

366
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,669
Who is that?

367
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:17,926
Why is he...

368
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,470
Is he someone you know?

369
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,681
No, not at all.

370
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,354
Hello.

371
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,481
Seo Dongju lives here, right?

372
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,817
I'm Ji Seonu.

373
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,735
Could I see Dongju?

374
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,821
Ji Seonu?

375
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,698
- Mom, give me a second.
- Taeyun.

376
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,825
Let me handle this.

377
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,386
You should've let him meet Dongju, Mom.

378
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,055
If someone with amnesia
sees an old friend,

379
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
it could help.

380
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,897
How shocked would he be
to learn Dongju has amnesia?

381
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,984
Come on, Director Seo is in urgent need...

382
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,405
Okay, I'll stop.

383
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,240
I'll shut my mouth.

384
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,745
More trivet for the <i>ramyeon</i> pots.

385
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,582
Remember Sugyeong?
The one I studied abroad with.

386
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,167
Assemblywoman Seok Sugyeong?

387
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,252
Yes.

388
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,465
He's being like that because it's a book
from her publication event.

389
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,759
A politician's book...

390
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,636
You don't look well.

391
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,850
Ji Yeongsu's son was here.

392
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,396
Secretary Gong,
what's for dinner?

393
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,399
It's been a while since I came home.
I should indulge a little.

394
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,569
I prepared Korean beef rib stew.

395
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,030
Nice!

396
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,630
Father.

397
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,589
Where's Father?

398
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,217
As you regain your memories
one by one like this,

399
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,263
sooner or later, everything will
come flooding back at once.

400
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,183
Remembering the liquor safe's code
is impressive enough.

401
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,268
Don't you think?

402
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:33,770
Yes.

403
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,772
So it's...

404
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,608
starting to come back bit by bit.

405
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,819
Yes.

406
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,821
Fortunately,

407
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,489
bit by bit...

408
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,957
Father, I might lose Yuseong Chemical!

409
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,209
The Yuseong Chemical bond manager
is on my side.

410
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,297
But the bank president just ordered them
to halt the merger and acquisition review.

411
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,719
There's a slight issue
with Mr. Yeom's funds, Father.

412
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,596
Step outside.

413
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,933
This is about Daesan Chemical
acquiring Yuseong Chemical, Father.

414
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,560
It is my business.

415
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:16,104
If you don't leave, we will.

416
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:18,815
Fine.

417
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:20,817
Father.

418
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,444
If I lose Yuseong Chemical...

419
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,741
you must compensate me for it.

420
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,748
What's Yeom so upset about?

421
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,585
Why is he suddenly overturning
the Yuseong Chemical deal?

422
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,462
It's not just a tantrum, Father.

423
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,258
He's pressuring us to sell Daesan Energy.

424
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,844
Again?

425
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,307
No one in their right mind
would sell a profitable company.

426
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,142
Mr. Yeom specializes in driving

427
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,229
thriving businesses into bankruptcy,
forcing them to sell.

428
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,901
I just met with Mr. Yeom,
but I didn't expect him to act this fast.

429
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:10,324
We need to open the safe
if we want to shut Yeom's mouth.

430
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,160
But we don't know the code.

431
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,162
Well...

432
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,957
The place where
you keep the paper with the code...

433
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,502
I already checked. Right?

434
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,256
Are you talking about
the reading card in the books?

435
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,883
That's the old code.

436
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,511
I lost the note with the new code.

437
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,403
<i>I have to hide it
in plain sight to keep it safe.</i>

438
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,165
That's right.

439
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,250
We hid it here together.

440
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,894
{\an8}LIQUOR SAFE
INNER SAFE

441
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,825
Director Seo,
you just saved Daesan Energy.

442
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,131
My false memories of you, President Huh,

443
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,550
will be cleared up soon too,

444
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,427
one by one.

445
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,305
False memories?

446
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,183
The memory of me...

447
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,436
shooting Director Seo.

448
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,361
Fake memories got mixed in
and messed you up, huh?

449
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,417
Go ahead and open it.

450
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,796
Take the cash and gold
and shove them down Yeom's throat.

451
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,592
I memorized it when you showed me.

452
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,975
Director Seo memorized
this 16-digit code...

453
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,187
That's right.

454
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,189
He lost his memory,
not his ability to memorize.

455
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,274
Right?

456
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,071
I knew it!

457
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,513
I heard from President Huh

458
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,850
that your memories
are starting to come back.

459
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,601
Yes.

460
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,729
The shock of watching my sister die

461
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,024
keeps pounding in my head.

462
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,650
Mmm.

463
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,944
Telling me to remember.

464
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,196
To bring it all back.

465
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,706
I hope you remember your sibling bond

466
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:31,042
and truly grieve for your sister.

467
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,796
Without the memories,
you can't even cry for her.

468
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,301
Your sister, who's now buried,
would be disappointed.

469
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,440
Thirty boxes of dress shirts
confirmed, sir.

470
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:58,028
Chairman Cha sincerely requests you
to let the Yuseong Chemical review resume.

471
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,197
Tell him

472
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,991
we'll take our time sorting things out.

473
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,663
More than any of that, I'm waiting
for you to get your memory back.

474
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,165
You have no idea

475
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,085
how desperately I want that.

476
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:16,881
Since you don't remember it.

477
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,345
You should get going, Director Seo.

478
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,577
Sir.

479
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,413
It's Manager Cho's ring.

480
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,792
Whose ring?

481
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,464
Bring the gun.

482
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,480
Dongju!

483
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,690
Dongju!

484
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,858
Get over here.

485
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,362
I said, get over here!

486
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,739
Yes, sir.

487
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,242
You thief.

488
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,120
My two trillion won
is in that head of yours!

489
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,664
What do you mean?

490
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,251
You stole my money and ran away!

491
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,252
Chief Cheon.

492
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,421
Director Seo.

493
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,423
You left this behind.

494
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,677
You killed Cho Yangchun
and faked your amnesia!

495
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,610
What are you rambling about,
crazy old geezer?

496
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,739
What money?

497
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,449
You...

498
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,161
You took the money I was going to use

499
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,413
for my love of this country...

500
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,228
Why are you so shocked?

501
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,522
Didn't you bring this to kill me?

502
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,193
Honestly, I'm tired
of chasing my memories.

503
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,029
And I'm left alone in this world.

504
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,198
I'm done.

505
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,450
It's all so exhausting.

506
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,119
So...

507
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,039
I'll disappear with the two trillion

508
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,208
stuck in my head.

509
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,668
I was wrong!

510
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,755
You didn't steal my money.

511
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,965
It's a misunderstanding...

512
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:08,635
Are you sure?

513
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,472
Why would I lie with a gun in front of me?

514
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,267
Do you want me to kneel and beg?

515
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,271
Do you?

516
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,710
BEE POLLEN
1 TEASPOON A DAY

517
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,922
<i>Put it in tea and drink it warm.
It's the good stuff.</i>

518
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,383
<i>If it's the good stuff,
you should have it.</i>

519
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,551
<i>Come on.</i>

520
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,346
Half of your body belongs to whom?

521
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
To you.

522
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,653
All right.

523
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,908
Tell them it's a gift

524
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:05,623
in return for the food they sent us
from Huicheol's birthday feast.

525
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,374
Okay, I will.

526
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,461
It's done.

527
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,297
I made plenty of the honey cookies
that you like.

528
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,632
Eat as much as you want.

529
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,675
Yes.

530
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,803
Goodness, I did my best,

531
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:25,433
but compared to the birthday feast,
this feels lacking, you know?

532
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,518
My birthday spread got ruined,

533
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,229
so I didn't really like the food, Aunt.

534
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,567
Your first birthday spread
as a married man got ruined?

535
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,069
By whom?

536
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,821
Someone called Secretary Gong.

537
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,200
The one who seems even more powerful

538
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,911
than my grandfather-in-law at times.

539
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,665
Hello.

540
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,792
Welcome.

541
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,063
Dongju.

542
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,442
Dongju.

543
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,282
What are you doing?

544
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,879
Dongju,

545
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,881
are you okay?

546
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,774
Do you see this scar?

547
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:58,694
It's from a gunshot.

548
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,947
The day you didn't show up for our trip,

549
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,826
I got shot on the yacht
and lost my memory.

550
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,831
And the day you said
we should go see my sister,

551
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,209
she died.

552
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,295
Sister Agnes...

553
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,380
I know.

554
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,299
You're sorry.

555
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:25,095
It wasn't your fault,
but you still feel responsible.

556
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,099
You're here to tell me that, right?

557
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,936
I'm sorry...

558
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,440
but I don't want to hear it.

559
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,027
Because I can't say it's okay.

560
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,365
I'm not okay at all.

561
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,578
This pain is unbearable,
I feel like dying.

562
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,465
Nothing good ever happened

563
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,134
when we were together.

564
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,763
Including how you married Yeom Huicheol.

565
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,057
So from now on,

566
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,810
don't look at me.

567
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,022
Turn away and live your life.

568
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,238
Dongju.

569
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,616
That's impossible.

570
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,600
What did Director Seo say?

571
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,769
He's coming down soon.

572
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,397
Did you tell him
it was a thoughtful gift from our in-laws?

573
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,982
Yes, Chairman.

574
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:04,110
Since the funeral,
he's barely come down for a meal...

575
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,903
I'm glad you brought good food.

576
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,238
Well done.

577
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,282
Yes, Grandfather.

578
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,369
- Where's Eunnam?
- She will be here soon.

579
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,291
She says she'll skip the meal
and come later...

580
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,209
for dessert.

581
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,880
Hey.

582
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,093
I'm glad you came.

583
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,469
Thank you.

584
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,638
Sit.

585
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,522
Let's eat.

586
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,950
I'll take the dessert out.

587
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,119
Chef Do.

588
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,371
Why did you put fruit here?

589
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,874
This batch of honey cookies
tastes completely off.

590
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,167
I tasted it.

591
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,502
She used Ceylon cinnamon
instead of traditional cassia powder

592
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,920
in the syrup.

593
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,297
You know what they say.

594
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:10,801
When the lady of the house strays,
even the food starts tasting off.

595
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,553
Maybe she's having an affair?

596
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,931
Jeez, that big mouth. My goodness.

597
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,142
I'm sure they're having some drama.

598
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,323
What?

599
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,742
Why is mine different?

600
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,578
There's cinnamon in the cookies.
I know you don't like it.

601
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,039
I see.

602
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,000
Hmm.

603
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,022
If Seo Dongju doesn't eat
the honey cookies with cinnamon in them,

604
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,111
it means
his memory loss has been all an act.

605
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,995
Director Seo.
Good thing you came down to eat, right?

606
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,621
Yes, Chairman.

607
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,928
Why didn't you have dinner?

608
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,474
Try it. It's good.

609
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,174
Director Seo.

610
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,637
Would you like some more cookies?

611
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,141
I've had enough.

612
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,315
Chairman.

613
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,567
- I'll go back to my room.
- Okay.

614
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,862
From now on,
make sure to come down for meals.

615
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,446
I will.

616
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:26,892
Dongju!

617
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,103
Dongju!

618
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,941
Call an ambulance.

619
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,568
Yes, Father.

620
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,778
What's wrong, Dongju?

621
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,946
Dongju!

622
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,158
We have a medical emergency
at 19-1 Hannam-dong. Please come quickly.

623
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,993
- Dongju, stay with me!
- Dongju!

624
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,578
What's going on?

625
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,580
- Open your eyes, Dongju!
- Dongju!

626
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,291
- Dongju!
- Stay with me!

627
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,959
Stay with me.

628
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,711
Dongju, stay with me!

629
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:56,796
Dongju!

630
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,508
Director Seo!

631
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,218
What's going on?

632
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,888
Director Seo!

633
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,434
Dongju, stay with me...

634
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,481
Dongju!

635
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,274
Dongju, stay with me!

636
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,652
Stay with me!

637
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,238
Dongju!

638
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:06,574
- Director Seo!
- Dongju!

639
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:01,211
Buried Hearts

640
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,132
{\an8}<i>Director Seo
won't make it through the night.</i>

641
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,885
{\an8}<i>We don't need
Cha Gukhui's testimony.</i>

642
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:11,764
{\an8}It's crucial that Cha Gangcheon feels
the threat of his daughter being taken.

643
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:15,059
{\an8}You being Yeom's favored junior
doesn't hold much value for me now.

644
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,895
{\an8}<i>Go confront
Yeom Jangseon head-on.</i>

645
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,272
{\an8}<i>Why are you
trying to kill Dongju?</i>

646
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,358
{\an8}You should get rid of him straightaway.

647
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:24,778
{\an8}<i>I'll make sure</i>

648
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,613
{\an8}<i>everything is...</i>

649
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,698
<i>wrapped up the right way.</i>
