CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,823
<i>Seonghyeon!</i>

5
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,618
<i>My mom is calling, "Seonghyeon!"</i>

6
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,247
Where is she calling from?

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,169
From heaven.

8
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,882
At first,

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,760
I thought Gyeongwon's son had survived.

10
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,345
What?

11
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,805
Turns out he wasn't Gyeongwon's son.

12
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,850
It was just a man who found me by chance.

13
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,895
I was lucky to survive.

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,106
But Sunho, Gyeongwon, and her child...

15
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,651
weren't so lucky...

16
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,996
{\an8}YEO SUNHO AND CHU SEONGHYEON
ARE BIOLOGICALLY RELATED

17
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,958
They're leaving...

18
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,419
the rest to you.

19
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,728
Hello?

20
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,314
Yes, it's the national highway
near Yangjin City.

21
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,276
Someone's injured!
Please send an ambulance quickly!

22
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,361
Yes.

{\an8}EPISODE 12

24
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,799
{\an8}<i>The man in the car behind you...</i>

25
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,885
{\an8}<i>Do you know him?</i>

26
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,262
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

27
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,931
{\an8}<i>It's my first time seeing him.</i>

28
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,518
{\an8}<i>No, I know who he is.</i>

29
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,937
{\an8}<i>I've seen him before.</i>

30
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,441
{\an8}<i>My mom's friend.</i>

31
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,118
Huh Ildo...

32
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,622
The one who killed my mom and dad...

33
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,252
was Huh Ildo.

34
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,184
You're still here.

35
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,852
Yeah.

36
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,563
I have a night shift, so I've got time.

37
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,441
Did you drink?

38
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,778
Ildo was going hard tonight.

39
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,865
I had to keep up
and ended up drinking too much.

40
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,619
I'll get going.

41
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,206
Ihyeon. I'm going to use your laptop.

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,208
What about your tablet?

43
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,042
Did you lose it again?

44
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,087
I left it at the office.

45
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,213
<i>Was Huh Ildo.</i>

46
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,425
Dad, pass me my phone.

47
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,137
Why are you so startled?

48
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,931
Dad, did you...

49
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,810
It wasn't on purpose.
The video of Director Seo was playing.

50
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,228
Dad!

51
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,314
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,609
But isn't it
Director Seo's memory of the accident?

53
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,278
Why is Ildo mentioned?

54
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,740
<i>Seo Dongju</i>

55
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,578
<i>has some unexplained trauma
related to Mr. Huh.</i>

56
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,250
He lost his memory

57
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,878
because of a gunshot wound.

58
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,006
But his misunderstanding runs so deep,
he even thinks

59
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,800
Mr. Huh was the one who shot him.

60
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,218
That's why

61
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,805
Mr. Huh brought him here
to put him under hypnosis.

62
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,808
That's just awful for Director Seo.

63
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,646
But he can't actually think Ildo did it.

64
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,274
That'd be ridiculous. Right, Ihyeon?

65
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,519
Ildo, congratulations
on becoming chairman.

66
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,648
- Thanks, Gukhui.
- Dad!

67
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,608
Yes, Taeyun.

68
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,288
That bastard...

69
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,188
Looks like you had a nightmare,
President Huh.

70
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,863
You really have no manners.

71
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,199
No matter how rough your upbringing was,

72
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,451
how many times
have you barged into this room?

73
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,955
Today, I came in
with your wife's permission.

74
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,835
She was going to wake you,
but I told her I'd wait.

75
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,630
More importantly,

76
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,717
take a look at this, President Huh.

77
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,643
It took me some time to find that article.

78
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,730
TRUCK CRASHES INTO 2 CARS AND FLEES.
3 DEAD, 1 CRITICALLY INJURED

79
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,693
Why would you find this article?

80
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,697
I guess Eunnam asked you to.

81
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,492
The "Yeo" in the article is Yeo Sunho.

82
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,120
And "Huh" is you.

83
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,080
But who was the woman riding with Yeo?

84
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,166
Gyeongwon.

85
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,209
Chu Gyeongwon.

86
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,462
Chu Gyeongwon...

87
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,011
Back in college,
we were all close friends.

88
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,722
Kang Ihyeon's father, Kang Seong, me,

89
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,809
Eunnam's mother and father,
Cha Deokhui and Yeo Sunho, and Chu...

90
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,359
I have a packed morning schedule,
so I missed my workout today.

91
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,446
Time for you to leave. And...

92
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,909
make sure you show

93
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,411
this exact article to Eunnam.

94
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,915
Tell her, loud and clear,
that Huh Ildo did not kill Yeo Sunho.

95
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,792
That's exactly what I was planning to do.

96
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,092
I mean, wouldn't it be
too cruel to tell Eunnam

97
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,470
such a painful truth?

98
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,977
A painful truth?

99
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,649
The newspaper article
that you found is the truth.

100
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,777
I barely made it with multiple surgeries
and months in the hospital.

101
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,446
That's not what the survivor
of the accident says.

102
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,950
I was the survivor of the accident!

103
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,621
Yeo Sunho,

104
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,249
Gyeongwon,

105
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,959
and her child...

106
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,836
They all died. I was the lone survivor.

107
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,811
What the hell are you doing?

108
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,316
You still don't remember it?

109
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,694
You fastened your seatbelt tight.

110
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:45,490
Stuffed your mouth with
gas station napkins like a mouthpiece.

111
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,327
Then you reversed your car
all the way back...

112
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,582
and sped up to ram the car ahead!

113
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,879
What the hell are you pulling?

114
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,048
Why are you making up things?

115
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,175
Bang!

116
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,886
Right before the car crashed,

117
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,806
you and I made eye contact.

118
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,643
I remember it so vividly.

119
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,065
Mister!

120
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,358
Help me!

121
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,526
Mister!

122
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,612
<i>Mister!</i>

123
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,947
Help me!

124
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,784
<i>Don't do it!</i>

125
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,913
Don't do it!

126
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,375
Who...

127
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,462
Who are you?

128
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,591
I'm Seonghyeon.

129
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,636
The kid who sat in the back seat.

130
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,050
The man I'd met for the first time
killed us.

131
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,136
But...

132
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,139
you knew I survived.

133
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:38,062
When I looked down
and saw you crawling up...

134
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,281
<i>our eyes met.</i>

135
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,408
No.

136
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,329
You're remembering it wrong.

137
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,874
A truck hit both my car
and Sunho's, then took off!

138
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,126
You were just a child.

139
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,839
You were traumatized and got it all wrong.

140
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,258
You lost your memory as a child,
didn't you?

141
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,010
Just like Eunnam, you're mistaken...

142
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,220
Don't come any closer.

143
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,974
If you do, I might just kill you.

144
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,480
Let's keep some distance, shall we?

145
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,777
Listen from where you are.

146
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,238
President Huh, Ms. Cha and Taeyun...

147
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,657
The three of you need to

148
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,578
cough up everything you got
from Daesan and leave.

149
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
What did you just say?

150
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,250
I'll give you until
the chairman's wedding day.

151
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,335
Who do you think you are?

152
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,420
Me?

153
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,299
A messenger from the heavens?

154
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,345
I never asked for this,

155
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,472
but after coming this close to death,

156
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,851
standing here to tell you the truth...

157
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:06,400
Doesn't it feel like I was sent from above
just for you, Huh Ildo?

158
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,241
I was so dumbfounded,
I just spouted some nonsense.

159
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,161
But you asked, who am I?

160
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:24,210
I'm just a guy desperate to kill Huh Ildo,
the man who murdered my parents.

161
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,922
So if you want to live,

162
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,590
you should leave Daesan, right?

163
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,676
No.

164
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,514
Just kill me instead.

165
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,517
I'm never leaving Daesan.

166
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,270
I built Daesan!

167
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,857
Daesan is mine.

168
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,705
Your days of staring out the window
while doing pull-ups are numbered.

169
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,040
Better make the most of them.

170
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,777
More importantly,
the one feeding right now is Seo Dongju,

171
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,988
and the top goldfish scrambling
to get fed is Yeom Jangseon.

172
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,908
It seems like that's the reality.

173
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,243
Come to your senses, sir.

174
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,874
HUH ILDO

175
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,879
Yes, Ildo.

176
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,632
I need a gun,

177
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,677
sir.

178
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,623
Back from court?

179
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,712
You must be exhausted.

180
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,721
Just what I needed.

181
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,105
We picked up
the divorce papers from court.

182
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,276
We wished each other well and parted ways.

183
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,571
Huicheol will file
the divorce papers right away.

184
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,499
What's this?

185
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,426
TRUCK CRASHES INTO 2 CARS AND FLEES.
3 DEAD, 1 CRITICALLY INJURED

186
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,401
Meal time!

187
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,828
You guys sure have it easy.

188
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,041
You're letting time rot away,
completely unaware.

189
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,001
So, have you made up yet?

190
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,007
Gosh.

191
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,512
Administrator.

192
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:50,059
You're acting all cool reading novels,

193
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,102
but I know you're scared.

194
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,523
I can feel it.

195
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,775
Just tell me
where the Dandelion files are,

196
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,318
and I'll guarantee your safety.

197
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,029
I told you, they don't exist.

198
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,032
It's like talking to a wall.

199
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,533
Okay.

200
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,870
Then I won't be bringing
your meals anymore.

201
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,623
Man, you're both going to starve.

202
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,792
Right?

203
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,836
Cho Yangchun, stop stuffing your face

204
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,548
and try convincing your buddy.

205
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,591
Starving to death

206
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,509
is no joke.

207
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,345
- Okay?
- You pig.

208
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,765
You think I'm easy to mess with
since I'm locked up?

209
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,478
Once they realize we're gone,
our guys will be here in no time.

210
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,563
Okay?

211
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:40,025
And you really think I'd betray my boss
over something like this?

212
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,111
Look.

213
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,655
B7?

214
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,782
What is this?

215
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,159
What a funny guy.

216
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,873
One of Yeom Jangseon's buildings

217
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,875
that my boss manages.

218
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,002
Basement level seven.

219
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,938
Looks like Mr. Huh had multiple surgeries
and a long hospital stay.

220
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,857
But I clearly heard

221
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,192
my mom and Secretary Gong
talking about it.

222
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,987
You were mistaken, Eunnam.

223
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,532
You were so shocked
by your father's death,

224
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,243
you might've made it up.

225
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,999
I looked into everything in detail,
not just this article.

226
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,337
Are you sure?

227
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,843
Yes.

228
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,845
I'm sure of it.

229
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,686
I'm right.

230
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,105
Trust me, Eunnam.

231
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,150
Okay.

232
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,699
If my mom wasn't behind it,

233
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,993
that's a relief.

234
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,040
I've spent every day hating her.

235
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,876
I was so scared.

236
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,712
Just the thought of my mom and Huh Ildo

237
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,631
plotting to kill my dad...

238
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,300
Don't think about it anymore.

239
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,553
It never happened.

240
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,263
Okay?

241
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,643
I was mistaken.

242
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,646
It's not true.

243
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
Yeah.

244
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,609
You were mistaken,

245
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,112
and it's not true.

246
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,532
Then that kid

247
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,368
and his mom...

248
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,286
They died in an accident?

249
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,125
Yes.

250
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,794
That kid...

251
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,213
and his mom...

252
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,800
they died in an accident.

253
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,929
<i>Eunnam,</i>

254
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,932
<i>as long as you're at peace,</i>

255
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,394
<i>that's all that matters to me.</i>

256
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,773
Yes, Dongju.

257
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,900
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

258
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,195
It's hidden in the building
where the Administrator works.

259
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,905
Yes.

260
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,491
I'll bring Cho Yangchun with me there.

261
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,660
I'm leaving now.

262
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,816
How about Prosecutor Yeom?

263
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,401
It's all settled.

264
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,320
You really did it.

265
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,908
I want to return to Daesan Energy.

266
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,618
Okay.

267
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,118
Let's look into it.

268
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,954
I heard everything from Dongju.

269
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,584
What did he tell you this time?

270
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,128
About my dad's car accident.

271
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,173
He wanted to help since I was struggling.

272
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,593
All this time,

273
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,595
I've been so scared.

274
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,389
Because the man who killed my dad
became my stepfather.

275
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,558
Yeo Eunnam!

276
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,941
Anyone want <i>ramyeon?</i>

277
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,800
Bang!

278
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,516
Right before the car crashed,

279
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,478
you and I made eye contact.

280
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,107
I remember it so vividly.

281
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:39,074
<i>I'm just a guy desperate to kill
Huh Ildo, the man who murdered my parents.</i>

282
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,954
<i>So if you want to live,
you should leave Daesan, right?</i>

283
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:52,880
Yes?

284
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,056
I'm ordering herbal medicine,
anything you want to add?

285
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,850
Tell them to add more licorice root.

286
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,061
If it's too bitter, Taeyun won't drink it.

287
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:13,524
Rather than giving them a call,
you should go visit Dr. Kwon's clinic.

288
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,818
While you're there, get your pulse checked

289
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,945
and pick up
some herbal medicine for yourself.

290
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,448
I'm fine.

291
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
What is it?

292
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,669
Don't mind Secretary Gong.

293
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,595
Mom.

294
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,936
That day...

295
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,812
I deleted this photo.

296
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,231
Why do you have it?

297
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,775
Where did you find it?

298
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,945
I hate this photo! Delete it now!

299
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,501
Hello?

300
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,835
<i>Hello.</i>

301
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,505
I got your number from Dr. Kang Ihyeon.

302
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,174
I have something to ask you.

303
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,968
Yes.

304
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,929
Then I'll head out now.

305
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,354
Eunnam.

306
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,898
It makes sense
your mom hates this picture.

307
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,819
That was the day
of your father's accident.

308
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,738
What exactly do you want to know?

309
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,369
Back then,

310
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,621
did President Huh know

311
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,666
about my dad's relationship
with the woman in this photo?

312
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,751
Chu Gyeongwon?

313
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,463
Between Sunho and Gyeongwon?
What kind of relationship?

314
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,258
Hey.

315
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,302
Sunho and Gyeongwon had nothing going on.

316
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,637
Did Deokhui say that?

317
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,391
If so, she's completely mistaken.

318
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,060
My goodness.

319
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,106
Sunho and I respected Gyeongwon.

320
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,861
Back in college,
when we were student activists,

321
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,991
Sunho, Deokhui, Ildo and I
all gave up activism to survive.

322
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,704
But Gyeongwon never gave up
and kept fighting for labor rights.

323
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,833
Back then, we were arrested,
beaten and even tortured.

324
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,044
Nonetheless,

325
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,005
none of us ever ratted each other out.

326
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,922
We were tight.

327
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,092
Sunho and Gyeongwon?
They were never a thing.

328
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,218
Then...

329
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,305
the child my dad was carrying...

330
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,682
Of course, that wasn't Sunho's kid.

331
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,934
Cha Deokhui is unbelievable.

332
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,812
She's spent years
obsessing over nonsense like this.

333
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,440
This won't do. I should talk to your mom.

334
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,986
My dad and Gyeongwon
really had nothing between them?

335
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,863
I told you, no.

336
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,744
By the way, where did you get that photo?

337
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,204
There was only one copy of it.

338
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,664
From Director Seo.

339
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,290
He showed me

340
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,461
a torn piece of the photo
with just my dad and the child left.

341
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,297
He found it by chance.

342
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,510
That's impossible.

343
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,805
I'm the only one who had that photo.

344
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,890
I want to keep that photo.

345
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,059
What? I want to keep it too.

346
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,727
What should we do?

347
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,314
Okay, I'll give it to you.

348
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,109
Deokhui, let's take one more photo.

349
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,283
"I need a gun, sir."

350
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,331
You called me just to say that,

351
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,835
and now you're here without a word.

352
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,256
You haven't even touched your wine.

353
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,051
What's weighing on you so heavily,

354
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,053
Ildo?

355
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,888
Give me the gun,

356
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,891
and I'll leave.

357
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,770
Planning to shoot Dongju?

358
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,107
Seo Dongju is...

359
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,321
Chu Gyeongwon's son, sir.

360
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,491
What did you say?

361
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,289
That kid died with Chu Gyeongwon.

362
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,085
Where the hell did you hear that nonsense?

363
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,254
From Seo Dongju himself.

364
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,841
He even knows
Yeo Sunho was his biological father.

365
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:49,926
He threatened...

366
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,305
my family to leave Daesan.

367
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,019
Is he claiming to be Yeo Sunho's son?

368
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,772
And what proof does he have?

369
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,193
Before I rammed into Yeo Sunho's car,

370
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,361
I stuffed napkins in my mouth
to brace for impact.

371
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,988
Do you remember me telling you that?

372
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,073
Of course.

373
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,243
How could I forget
your brilliant handiwork?

374
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,412
Seo Dongju...

375
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:23,084
remembers every detail of that night.

376
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:29,883
Damn.

377
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,056
I need to get that gun fast.

378
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,641
What do you mean?

379
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,478
I lost one to Seo Dongju last time.

380
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,105
Even if we get another gun,

381
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,609
we can't just kill a guy
managing the two trillion won

382
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,278
without The Elder's approval.

383
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,364
What do we do?

384
00:33:58,787 --> 00:33:59,788
Then...

385
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,752
Get me the exact same gun
as the one Seo Dongju has.

386
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,465
We can make it look like
he couldn't handle the truth

387
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,469
of him being Yeo Eunnam's half-brother...

388
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,807
and shot himself with the gun.

389
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,934
Oh,

390
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,562
so you want to make it look like
he took his own life.

391
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,524
You never change.

392
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:33,363
When things get tough,
you always make the boldest moves.

393
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,242
I had to make it look like
I was in the accident

394
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,869
to avoid any loose ends.

395
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,708
Smart move, my friend.

396
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,964
The chairman put Director Seo

397
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,634
in charge of bringing his illegitimate son
into the Daesan family.

398
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,096
For Taeyun's future,

399
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,057
Director Seo needs to disappear.

400
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,456
We need Director Seo alive

401
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,959
until Ji Yeongsu becomes
Daesan's matriarch.

402
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
Let's decide...

403
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,798
his death date ourselves.

404
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,522
My goodness.

405
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,982
It's been a while.

406
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,067
But...

407
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,818
you must be unwell.

408
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,030
Yeah, we were in an accident.

409
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,116
The Administrator got hurt too.

410
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,953
He asked us to check
some underground facilities for repairs.

411
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,997
When is he coming back?

412
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,668
Let him know that Mr. Yeom
has been calling non-stop.

413
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,835
Yes, will do.

414
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,003
The keys...

415
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,713
Which room keys do you need?

416
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,758
- Just hand us everything.
- Okay.

417
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,136
- Take care.
- Yes, you too.

418
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,069
Which way from here?

419
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,488
- Left turn.
- Left?

420
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,996
Gosh.

421
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,834
What kind of basement is this? It's huge.

422
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,502
You sure you know where to look?

423
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,672
I told you, not exactly.

424
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,465
Let's head there first.

425
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:03,053
The Administrator said
he hid it deep underground.

426
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,139
But...

427
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,932
I've got a good guess.

428
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,852
Just don't forget to let me go
once we find it.

429
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,776
We've cut the building's power.

430
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,911
Wow, it looks quite scary.
Feels like <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

431
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,748
- Right turn.
- Right turn.

432
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,291
Stop.

433
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,376
Turn around.

434
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,294
Seriously.

435
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,671
The opposite way.

436
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,506
Jeez.

437
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,261
Crack them open.
There are hidden vaults inside.

438
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,889
My boss has kept
his stash of classified intel here.

439
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,057
I'm sure he hid it here.

440
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,991
Is this it?

441
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,164
What?

442
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,501
What is this?

443
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,046
They're empty.

444
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,925
Why isn't it here?

445
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,887
No way... There's nowhere else
for him to hide it!

446
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,723
Hold on. It has to be here!

447
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,060
No, wait.
Why would you give him that? Seriously!

448
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,353
Hold on!

449
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,313
Just hold on!

450
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,898
Hold on, think about it!

451
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,776
I'm serious. There's nowhere else!

452
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,611
Just give me a break!

453
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,447
Why...

454
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,700
Why isn't it here?

455
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,884
Hey!

456
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,556
Starting tomorrow,
you won't get a single bite.

457
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,352
If you want to eat,
work it out with the Administrator.

458
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,812
That's your only way to survive.

459
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,647
Actually, I have one place in mind...

460
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,151
Forget it, just follow me. Let's go.

461
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,367
Walk straight.

462
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,786
I said, walk straight!

463
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,914
Jeez.

464
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,457
Damn it.

465
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,752
What happened?

466
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,137
Oh Jungho!

467
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,900
- Ilnam!
- Yes!

468
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,528
What happened?

469
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,279
He's still alive.

470
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,240
Yeah, I'll call Dr. Park.

471
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,371
Damn, these bastards are fast.

472
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
Dr. Park!

473
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,008
Get over here, quick!

474
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,678
Yes, we're at...

475
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,008
Ilnam.

476
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,926
Yeah?

477
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,137
Over here.

478
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,373
This is it.

479
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,544
The Dandelion files
Yeom Jangseon was so desperate to find.

480
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,171
YEOM JANGSEON

481
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,048
How long will it take
to recover the recording?

482
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,302
There's a software
that converts audio to text, right?

483
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,182
But since it was recorded secretly,
there's likely background noise.

484
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,893
It'll take time
to get an accurate transcript.

485
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,855
I'll work on anything
related to Yeom Jangseon first.

486
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,816
And search the transcript
for the four people in Kang Seong's photo.

487
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,443
Cha Deokhui too.

488
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,820
Cha Deokhui too?

489
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,739
Yes, I need it.

490
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,116
Then how about we toast to that tonight?

491
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,826
I'll go grab some beer.

492
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,911
A toast?

493
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,704
Of course.

494
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:08,503
All this while,
we've gone through hell to get these.

495
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,129
Let's have a drink tonight.

496
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,923
It's unbelievable.

497
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,341
Really? What about it?

498
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,886
The seasoning. It's so good,
I made it my go-to spot...

499
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,056
I just love <i>gopchang.</i>

500
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,227
DAESAN GROUP

501
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,233
I do wonder what's inside.

502
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,821
Could it be something
as strong as a bomb in this old box?

503
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,532
Weren't we toasting?

504
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,158
We really worked for this.

505
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,618
Right, I'll give the toast.

506
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,912
Raise your glasses high!

507
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,623
To deep friendships and fair love.

508
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,792
Cheers!

509
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,425
I go half and half with soju and beer.

510
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,388
Hey, I hate messing around with drinks.

511
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,056
Jeez.

512
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,893
- Dongju, you mix it and make it good.
- Yeah, I got it.

513
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,814
See? Look at this. They say
if it looks good, it tastes good too.

514
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,358
Look at that perfect ratio.

515
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,527
Isn't that too weak?

516
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,365
Gosh, thank you.

517
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,159
Let's toast again.

518
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,035
Raise your glasses high!

519
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,123
To deep friendships and fair love. Cheers!

520
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,006
Let's have another.

521
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,187
How many subsidiaries
does our company have?

522
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,354
I checked the venue,

523
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,524
but some of the executives
aren't here yet.

524
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,069
Not sure exactly how many.

525
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,450
The CEO of Daesan Chemical isn't here...

526
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,076
Seonu.

527
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,162
I'm the CEO of Daesan Chemical.

528
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,165
You're the CEO of Daesan Chemical?

529
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,125
Wow, you're so cool.

530
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,337
Hey, quiet down.

531
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,881
Big sister.

532
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,092
Nothing I do
ever sits right with you, right?

533
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:25,431
Still, I'm your little brother now,
so call me Seonu friendly, okay?

534
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,683
Oh, right.

535
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,604
And Taeyun, since you're my nephew now,
call me uncle.

536
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,774
You too.

537
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,656
My new brothers-in-law,
I'll be counting on you.

538
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,116
Sure.

539
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,826
Seonu...

540
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,787
Yes...

541
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,206
Stay put.

542
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,959
Your grandfather will be here soon.

543
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,672
Hey.

544
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,840
It's been a while.

545
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,470
Congratulations.
You've got yourself a fine new stepmother.

546
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,224
Is Prosecutor Yeom doing well?

547
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,685
I always worry about him.

548
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,276
The chairman will be arriving soon.

549
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,064
Your bridal makeup looks great.

550
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,321
Chairman, we're going to be late
for the wedding.

551
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:07,949
Wait.

552
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,785
Why do you keep pushing me to marry?

553
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,079
With a total stranger.

554
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,839
Father, there you go with the jokes again.

555
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,216
You always do this on important days.

556
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,842
Right, honey?

557
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,927
What?

558
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,803
Follow me, Seonu.

559
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,930
Okay.

00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,140
Chairman...

561
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,684
Get in the car, Seonu.

562
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,329
Chairman.

563
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,165
Do you recognize me?

564
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,085
I'm Yeom Jangseon.

565
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,754

00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,801
Gosh, Mr. Yeom.

Well...

568
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,223
That woman keeps insisting we get married.

569
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,892
And...

570
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,061
He's...

00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,563

572
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,442
Of course.

573
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,778
Of course, my son.

574
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,448
You like Seonu, don't you?

575
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,493
Of course, I do. My son.

576
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,248
If you want to live
with this son of yours,

577
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,585
you'll have to marry that woman
you just met today, Chairman.

578
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,183
Chairman, take your time getting out.

579
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,145

Seonu is at the hotel too.

586
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,291
Grandfather wouldn't let him go.

587
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,001
Is the chairman okay?

588
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,671
Grandfather married
a woman he just met today.

00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,176
