Buried Hearts

00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,921
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,219
I took you, a worthless brat
raised under a useless father,

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,679
and made you a prosecutor.

6
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,681
Instead of repaying me,

7
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,267
you asked for a divorce first
and put me at a loss.

8
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,311
I'm sorry, Uncle.

9
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,189
If you're sorry, bring Yeo Eunnam back.

10
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,651
Hold out until she's the one
begging for a divorce!

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
It's not about that…

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,407
I shouldn't have used your authority

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,826
to kick Dongju
out of the rugby team back then.

14
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,206
I should've taken on that thug myself
and lost fair and square.

15
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,501
Back then, I thought I'd won.

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,135
But I was wrong, Uncle.

17
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,771
You think losing to Seo Dongju
would've been better?

18
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,815
- Aunt.
- Honey!

19
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,150
Honey, don't do this.

20
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,235
- Move.
- I'm begging you, honey.

21
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,403
Honey, please!

22
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,155
- Move!
- Honey, please!

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,364
Damn it, move!

24
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,449
Aunt!

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,497
- That professor...
- Where did you get this photo?

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,125
Do you know him?

27
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,919
Yes.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,547
That's my dad.

29
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,365
The kid in my dad's arms isn't me.

30
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,951
Do you know who this kid is?

31
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,707
That kid?

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,336
I don't know either.

33
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,677
Hold on.

34
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,279
Not going to tell me
where you got this photo of my dad?

35
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,415
Oh.

36
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,625
It's the same photo.

37
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,298
She must be the kid's mother.

38
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,973
I came across it by chance
while looking into

39
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,308
Mr. Yeom and Huh Ildo's past.

40
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,895
By chance?

41
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:52,983
Yeah.

42
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,693
By chance.

43
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,536
I'm sending this photo to my phone.

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,878
But this kid…

45
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
Yes, Grandfather.

46
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,009
Yes.

47
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,594
Yes.

48
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,305
No.

49
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,058
No.

50
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,654
UNCLE-IN-LAW

51
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:40,739
These photos…

52
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,408
You sent these to Mr. Yeom
to threaten him?

53
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,994
Hey, Eunnam. Are you insane?

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,413
Why did you do something so risky?

55
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,540
I just wanted to get back to you sooner.

56
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,543
I had to get a divorce…

57
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,964
to stay at the hospital and protect you.

58
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,384
I'm sorry for worrying you.

59
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,846
But this was the only way.

60
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,569
<i>Yes.</i>

61
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>That's my dad.</i>

00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,831
{\an8}EPISODE 11

63
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,884
{\an8}Eunnam, when Prosecutor Yeom called

64
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,557
{\an8}to apologize for kicking you out,
I could tell right away.

65
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,977
He doesn't want this divorce.

66
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,770
Go back.

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,691
Go back and live a happy life
with your loving husband.

68
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,402
Your grandfather, your father, and I…

69
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,696
We're all doing this for you.

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,158
We both felt
there was no point in staying married.

71
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,871
In exchange
for marrying Prosecutor Yeom,

72
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,291
you demanded Daesan Energy shares,

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,335
and you got them from your grandfather.

74
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,379
And you didn't stop there.

75
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,466
You demanded more than I offered,

76
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,804
threatening to call off the wedding
until the day before.

77
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,640
I was just doing business
the way you taught me.

78
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,892
How much do you want?

79
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,853
How much more for you to stay married?

80
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,611
You know exactly
how much I love Daesan Energy shares.

81
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,072
So, how much will it take?

82
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,329
I'll return every single share
I got for marrying Huicheol.

83
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,248
Please allow the divorce, Grandfather.

84
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:18,021
My husband was out all day
to find fresh, wild loaches in a hurry.

85
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,606
He sure had a rough time.

86
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,526
I mean, we already had
a fridge full of top-quality eel.

87
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,904
Suddenly it had to be
wild, local, and fresh.

88
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,866
Rough time? Not at all.

89
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,035
Since Director Seo likes loach stew,

90
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,871
the chairman insisted on
using wild-caught loaches.

91
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,499
I took it as my duty
to find them.

92
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,255
I kept the seasoning mild
since Director Seo's just recovering.

93
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,468
The chairman might find it bland.
Put some soy sauce on the side.

94
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,761
Yes.

95
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,974
Sometimes, it almost seems like
he's the chairman's hidden son.

96
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
"Make what Director Seo likes."

97
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,770
"Since it's good for him, prepare that."

98
00:07:58,853 --> 00:07:59,854
You know.

99
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,652
If you run your mouth like that again,
you're fired on the spot.

100
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,615
Even if the chairman ends up going hungry
without Chef Do, I'll sack you two.

101
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,665
Do you seriously want to get fired?

102
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,291
Don't worry.

103
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,418
They can't fire us.

104
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,877
Seriously…

105
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,604
Come in, Secretary Gong.

106
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,113
Have a seat.

107
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,827
What brings you all the way

108
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,328
to my room?

109
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,082
You know, Seonghyeon…

110
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,963
I found him.

111
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,467
I sent it to your phone.

112
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,097
DIRECTOR SEO

113
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,573
So, that must be Seonghyeon.

114
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,750
This Daesan Group badge

115
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,628
was pinned on by Chief Yeo Sunho.

116
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,174
There you go.

117
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,221
Thank you.

118
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,476
Wow, that's awesome!

119
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,818
The chairman remembers Seonghyeon,
but you kept insisting you didn't know.

120
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,114
Will Ms. Cha insist
she doesn't know either?

121
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,741
She doesn't even know the kid's name.

122
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,951
She's never met him.

123
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,036
Is that so?

124
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,998
Then please keep it a secret until the end

125
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,127
that the child named Seonghyeon is me.

126
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,795
Director Seo…

127
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,547
I came here to ask you this favor.

128
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,260
Please promise me.

129
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,639
Please…

130
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
promise me, Secretary Gong.

131
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,815
I promise.

132
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,819
Thank you.

133
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,072
Wait.

134
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,253
Chief Yeo Sunho

135
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,256
asked me to give this book
to Seonghyeon as a gift.

136
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,057
Why did you keep it all this time?

137
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,518
He passed away
right after asking me to do this.

138
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,562
I guess…

139
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,647
that's why

140
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,066
I couldn't bring myself to throw it away.

141
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
Inside,

142
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,406
there's a postcard with a drawing
from Chief Yeo Sunho.

143
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,493
Give up

144
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,162
Eunnam.

145
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,872
Director Seo.

146
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,919
The audacity of these adults,
always sticking their noses in.

147
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
Secretary Gong.

148
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,261
You and Ms. Cha plotted together
to abandon young Seonghyeon. No…

149
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,180
You killed him.

150
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,517
You thought Seonghyeon was dead,
but he showed up alive as Seo Dongju.

151
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,022
Do you still wish for him to die?

152
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,774
Director Seo,
watch what you say.

153
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,693
Then tell me why a child
even the chairman acknowledged

154
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,570
is receiving his dead father's gift

155
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,615
only now, decades later?

156
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,369
Who my father was,

157
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,539
why he died, where my birth mother is,
what she's up to now,

158
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,084
and what the elders of Daesan Group
did to me.

159
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,091
I want to line them all up
and make them confess everything they did.

160
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,513
But I've decided to let it go

161
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,057
for Eunnam's sake.

162
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,603
If you don't want this to get ugly,

163
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,856
keep your promise, Secretary Gong.

164
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,560
{\an8}A BUTTERFLY'S DREAM

165
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,075
SEONGHYEON,
I'LL GET YOU ALL THE BOOKS YOU WANT

166
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,452
SEE YOU AGAIN
FROM SUNHO

167
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,791
Yeo Sunho.

168
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,087
This is where…

169
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,007
our fate ends.

170
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,267
<i>Just in case you were worried,
I wanted to let you know.</i>

171
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,813
<i>Seonghyeon is managing</i>

172
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,232
<i>just fine on his own,</i>

173
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,484
<i>so don't worry about him.</i>

174
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,456
<i>She must be the kid's mother.</i>

175
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,672
I'm not going to look for you.

176
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
I figured you'd be here.

177
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,159
I held my ground.

178
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,581
The chairman must've been furious.
How did you manage that?

179
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,875
I handled it like a business deal.

180
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,377
My marriage was just business

181
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,713
for my grandfather and me.

182
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,510
By the way, Dongju…

183
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,641
About the kid with my dad in the photo…

184
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,230
I think I know who he is.

185
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,861
Who is he?

186
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,949
My dad brought him home once.

187
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,914
Thank you.

188
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,044
Wow, that's awesome!

189
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,470
He's dead,

190
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,764
Dongju.

191
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,065
My dad died in a car accident.

192
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,817
That night…

193
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,905
I could only sleep when Dad read to me.

194
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,115
But he never came home. Mom didn't either.

195
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,576
I remember crying a lot.

196
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,665
Secretary Gong put me to bed
in the master bedroom.

197
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,004
What do we do?

198
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,839
What do we do?

199
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,969
Ildo…

200
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,887
My husband…

201
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,098
- The kid's mom and the kid…
- Mom?

202
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,976
He ran them over with his car.

203
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,897
I told him I wished they'd just die,

204
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,692
and he actually killed all of them.

205
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,776
What do we do?

206
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>What do we do?</i>

207
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,950
That kid,

208
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,578
the kid's mother…

209
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,332
and my dad. Huh Ildo killed them all.

210
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,211
I heard my mom whisper.

211
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,548
"I told him I wished they'd just die,

212
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,050
and he actually killed all of them."

213
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,013
I was terrified.

214
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,516
I felt like I shouldn't wake up,
so I pretended to sleep.

215
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,314
Maybe you just misheard.

216
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,733
After you learned your father died,

217
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,027
you might've thought you'd heard that.

218
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,737
Later on,

219
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,699
I tried looking up car accident records,

220
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,826
visiting the accident area's
police station…

221
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,371
But there were
no accident records or articles anywhere.

222
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,916
The Daesan family's son-in-law
died in a car accident,

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,376
but there was no article on it.

224
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,544
Doesn't that seem strange?

225
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,638
<i>The chairman is waiting for you.</i>

226
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,395
Director Seo, come on in.

227
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,487
Looks like it's just the three
of us having a cozy meal.

228
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,574
It's because Taeyun and my wife
don't enjoy eating loach stew.

229
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,119
That kid,

230
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,205
<i>the kid's mother…</i>

231
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
<i>and my dad.</i>

232
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,917
<i>Huh Ildo killed them all.</i>

233
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,890
Director Seo!

234
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,851
<i>Madame Pi.</i>

235
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,355
<i>Do you know the neighborhood
where I first met Yeonju and my mom?</i>

236
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,192
It's been a long time,

237
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,903
but not much has changed,

238
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:57,655
Dongju.

239
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,077
Apparently,
when lost children see a rail road track,

240
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,538
they follow it endlessly.

241
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,082
Since the tracks show the way,

242
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,084
they just run straight along them.

243
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,462
So, in the past,

244
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,381
if a child went missing,

245
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,133
people would search

246
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,262
the towns along the railroad.

247
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,592
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

248
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,725
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

249
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,198
That poor child must have

250
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,201
walked for miles
in the middle of the night.

251
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,038
How scared and tired must he have been?

252
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,501
What do you think Yeonju and my mom
thought when they first saw me?

253
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,295
They thought you were their savior.

254
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,841
Because you

255
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,428
saved that crazy Youjin
who was about to end it all…

256
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,933
by taking pills.

257
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,770
Yeonju thought

258
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,940
her mom had died
and was too scared to go back home.

259
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,984
But when you, a stranger,

260
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,945
barged in

261
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,490
and cried for food,

262
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,117
shaking Youjin awake,

263
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,539
Yeonju started crying for food too.

264
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,670
The sound of both your cries
brought Youjin back to her senses

265
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,339
right at the gates of death.

266
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:46,740
Isn't this awesome?

267
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,828
What's your name?

268
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,121
Seonghyeon.

269
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,707
No, your name is Dongju.

270
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,003
You said if I had a brother,
you'd name him Dongju, right?

271
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,464
How old are you?

272
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,550
Well…

273
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,552
I don't know.

274
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,930
Where's your mom?

275
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,976
Mom.

276
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,193
NOVEMBER 1998, CAR ACCIDENT

277
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,005
I'll need to keep looking,

278
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,674
but it'll be hard
to find an article online.

279
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,885
At this point, it feels like

280
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,638
someone must have deliberately
covered up the accident.

281
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,725
Do you think it was Chairman Cha?

282
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,728
Firstly,

283
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,774
go check the local newspapers
in the Gyeonggi area.

284
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:05,152
Got it.
I'll search through the local papers.

285
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,698
You said three people died, right?

286
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,533
Maybe.

287
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,618
Dongju.

288
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,246
If everything turns out to be true,

289
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,958
it'll be hard for Eunnam to handle.

290
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,501
How about we just bury it?

291
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,585
No.

292
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,088
I need to know the truth.

293
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,340
I must.

294
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,324
<i>Ildo, hurry up and come.</i>

295
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:57,371
<i>I'm about to introduce someone
who's like a gift to you.</i>

296
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,337
Who's coming?

297
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,256
She's already here.

298
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,135
Sir, President Huh is here.

299
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,857
Father, why did you ask to see me alone?

300
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,074
Father, I'm here.

301
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,583
Director Seo.

302
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,836
My goodness.

303
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,759
So, is that my father's secret vault?
The one I only heard rumors about?

304
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,344
Yes.

305
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,679
Come in.

306
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,612
Gosh.

307
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,697
Director Seo!

308
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,700
Are all these filled with dollars?

309
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,619
Yes.

310
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,820
Are all of these…

311
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,905
my fingerprints?

312
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,491
Apparently.

313
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,869
What about my father?

314
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,040
If he finds out,

315
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,419
I'm as good as dead, Director Seo.

316
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,715
I can help you out.

317
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,217
But…

318
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,136
there's a condition.

319
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,393
<i>Director Seo,</i>

320
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,270
don't waste your time.

321
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,565
Ji Seonu will never be part of our family.

322
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,735
It's our family's business.

323
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,738
<i>We won't tolerate outsiders interfering.
Keep that in mind.</i>

324
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,365
<i>Or you'll regret it later.</i>

325
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,326
<i>The matter with Seonu</i>

326
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,620
<i>is about Daesan Group.</i>

327
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,170
Mom. Grandfather wants everyone to gather.

328
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,436
I called you
all here suddenly…

329
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh, yes.

330
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,611
This tea is made from organic tangerines
from our Jeju orchard.

331
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,571
Chef Do made this tangerine peel tea.

332
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,323
I specially requested it.

333
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,662
And…

334
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,288
And Taeyun…

335
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,707
Is your master's thesis going well?

336
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,459
Yes, Grandfather.

337
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,543
Good.

338
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,590
Now, let's drink.

339
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,592
Secretary Gong,

340
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,219
take this away.

341
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,683
Honey.

342
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,851
I need a clear head
to hear what Father has to say.

343
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,937
Deokhui.

344
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,897
It's just tea, not alcohol.

345
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,275
Gukhui, don't get drunk on tea
and stay sharp.

346
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,575
Father, don't hesitate
and say what you need to say.

347
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,162
Dr. Kim is busy with hospital work,
he needs to go back.

348
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,790
Since my eldest insists
I cut to the chase,

349
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,417
I will.

350
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,712
The boy who brought me home that day…

351
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,047
He's my son.

352
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,768
So what?

353
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:13,729
What?

354
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,148
So what about it?

355
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,984
Well…

356
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,944
So…

357
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,364
Well, what I mean is…

358
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,324
The chairman plans to marry Ji Yeongsu

359
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,578
and register Ji Seonu as Cha Seonu.

360
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:37,335
I will be overseeing the marriage
and his son's registration.

361
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,297
I need coffee…

362
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,840
- Gosh.
- Wait.

363
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,592
{\an8}Have a seat here.

364
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,346
Secretary Gong.

365
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,723
Have some of this.

366
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,685
When you're tired from work,
just pop this in your mouth.

367
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,395
It'll give you a quick boost.

368
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,734
So…

369
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,237
the chairman did have a hidden child.

370
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,948
My goodness.

371
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,575
What a surprise.

372
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,660
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

373
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,414
Gukhui and I

374
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,043
can't accept any family
beyond the two of us, Father.

375
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,467
Well…

376
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:34,226
My husband and I always wanted you
to be happy in your later years, Father.

377
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,145
I welcome my stepmother

378
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,064
and younger brother.

379
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,987
I agree with my wife,

380
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,614
Father.

381
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,137
A woman willing to marry
a man she knows has dementia.

382
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,806
What do you think her reason is?

383
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,182
Money, of course.

384
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,017
And,

385
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,644
for her son.

386
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,813
Who also happens to be…

387
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,857
my son.

388
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,444
I heard my eldest daughter's opinion.

389
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,156
Let's hear what my son-in-law thinks.

390
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,327
President Huh,

391
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,705
you attempted to kill me.

392
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,915
That makes you an attempted murderer.

393
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,668
From now on,

394
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,672
I'll be making good use of that weakness.

395
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,134
I respect…

396
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:50,844
your decision.

397
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,528
I'll coordinate in advance
so that Director Cha and President Huh

398
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,113
support your marriage.

399
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,490
Can that be coordinated?

400
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,583
Grandfather.

401
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,585
I'll support you

402
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,504
on the condition
that you give up reclaiming

403
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,007
my Daesan Energy shares.

404
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,137
I'm against it, Grandfather.

405
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,599
My opinion probably doesn't matter,

406
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,184
but since you called me here…

407
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,800
Ji Yeongsu as my stepmother
and Ji Seonu as my brother?

408
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,927
After everything I went through…

409
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,740
Sir!

410
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,375
I came to see Mr. Yeom.

411
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,253
He went to a gathering
with his junior prosecutors.

412
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,425
I don't know why he asked you to come
when he already had plans.

413
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,636
He wasn't answering my calls,
so I just came.

414
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,179
I'll wait here until he returns.

415
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,724
Out here?

416
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,268
Just come inside.

417
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,946
What happened to Huicheol

418
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,575
makes it hard for me to be kind to you.

419
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,201
That's why my tone was harsh.

420
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:22,704
Follow me.

421
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,581
I'll get you some tea.

422
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,344
After eating the honey cookies I made,
you collapsed.

423
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,139
My niece-in-law
wanted to take care of you,

424
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,016
so she decided to get a divorce.

425
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,518
I can't help but wonder

426
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,937
if I was the cause
of their marriage falling apart.

427
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,398
It weighs on me.

428
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,400
Even in the midst of that,

429
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,196
when I heard you got back on your feet,

430
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,991
I thanked God, Buddha,
and every spirit out there.

431
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,786
I was so grateful.

432
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,666
Drink your tea.

433
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,750
Yes.

434
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,766
HOUSE OF OVERFLOW

435
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,850
Seonghyeon!

436
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,770
Sit here.

437
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,230
Let's take a photo.

438
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,648
Seonghyeon, look here.

439
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,149
Look at Mom.

440
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,735
- Over there.
- One, two, three.

441
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,074
There we go.

442
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,248
- Here.
- Yes.

443
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,042
Thank you for looking after Seonghyeon.

444
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,463
He's grown on me these past few days.
I don't want to let him go.

445
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,260
Seonghyeon, I'll get the photos developed.
Come back to get it sometime.

446
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,386
Okay.

447
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,138
- Mom.
- Yes?

448
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,472
Let's come back tomorrow.

449
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,478
Our main house is quite impressive, right?

450
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,313
Yes.

451
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,733
This is my first time in the main house,

452
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,026
but it feels familiar,
like I've been here before.

453
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,864
So you do remember coming here
when you were little…

454
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,201
Director Seo.

455
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:31,291
How dare you enter my main house
and even sit there without my approval?

456
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,335
My apologies for not notifying you.

457
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,006
I'm curious what conversation
had you two so engaged, honey?

458
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,760
And Director Seo?

459
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,846
We were just talking about how concerned

460
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,474
she was when I collapsed
after eating the honey cookies.

461
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,558
Yes.

462
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,310
The honey cookies.

463
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,354
CONTRACT TERMINATION AGREEMENT

464
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,148
{\an8}CHA GANGCHEON

465
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,151
{\an8}YEOM JANGSEON

466
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,336
Sir, it's done.

467
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,921
Store them properly.

468
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,005
Yes, sir.

469
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,552
I thought Chairman Cha was a grand man,

470
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,890
but it turns out he's quite petty.

471
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,018
"Since Huicheol wanted
to end the marriage,

472
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,062
no penalty fees are necessary."

473
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,565
I've told him multiple times,
yet he still wants

474
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,901
a written confirmation.

475
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,404
He prefers proper closure.

476
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:52,080
The funds you laundered
from my Swiss account were well used.

477
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,500
Thanks to you,
I kept those recruits from switching sides

478
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:00,338
and made sure
they'd never set foot in politics again.

479
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,222
Come here for a moment.

480
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,565
Come up here.

481
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,555
Do you see yourself

482
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,348
as the one…

483
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,311
feeding the goldfish

484
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,772
or the goldfish waiting to be fed?

485
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,611
Director Seo.

486
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,240
No matter how much you use
The Elder as your shield,

487
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,492
walk in and out of my house as you please,

488
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,371
or carry around Chairman Cha's
personal seal like it's yours…

489
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,585
In the end, you're just another goldfish
eagerly opening its mouth,

490
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,546
desperate for every scrap
of food tossed its way.

491
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,090
No matter how high you climb,

492
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,637
the best you can hope for
is being the first in line to get fed.

493
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,516
That's where your story ends.

494
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,814
The two trillion won…

495
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,816
I'll overlook it.

496
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,235
Take it all
and leave this country immediately.

497
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,656
I have already taken it.
You talk like you're offering it to me.

498
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,075
The two trillion won is mine.

499
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,912
And if I ever do leave Korea,

500
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,831
it'll be after I kill you.

501
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,625
Telling me to leave right now…

502
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,710
Are you in a hurry to die?

503
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,714
You lunatic…

504
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,718
Take my warning seriously.

505
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,973
If you hold out any longer,
you'll experience hell on earth.

506
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,850
A brutal hell where
you'd drive an awl through your eyes

507
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,644
and hammer a stake into your ears.

508
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,399
Where did you get this photo?

509
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,609
Do you know him?

510
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,236
Yes.

511
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,030
That's my dad.

512
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,743
Seems like you've done
a thorough background check on me.

513
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,372
But I've been through that kind
of hell plenty of times.

514
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,000
So, save your concern.

515
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,004
More importantly,
the one feeding right now is Seo Dongju,

516
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,340
and the top goldfish scrambling
to get fed is Yeom Jangseon.

517
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,676
It seems like that's the reality.

518
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,720
Come to your senses, sir.

519
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:58,307
Thinking that the sky you see
from inside the fishbowl is all there is.

520
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,478
That's your limit.

521
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,443
Sir.

522
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,624
I brought the wine
that was uncorked earlier, sir.

523
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,544
Enjoy the wine while you can.

524
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,796
You might find yourself begging
for a single drop

525
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,506
on your tongue someday.

526
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,259
I'll be going then.

527
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,557
Guho.

528
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,353
That bastard's better than his father.

529
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,736
It's almost a shame to kill him.

530
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,579
Yes.

531
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,664
Director Seo.

532
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,999
Dongju.

533
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,460
I called Seonu and Yeongsu here

534
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,087
to show them around the company.

535
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,005
Have a seat.

536
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,090
Yes, sir.

537
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,718
Seonu.

538
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:16,803
Yes.

539
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,347
Director Seo will help you,

540
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,432
so start learning the ropes
of the company.

541
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,517
What?

542
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,269
I'm not just going
to hand this position over to you.

543
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,896
Give it your best.

544
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,401
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

545
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,949
Well, then, we'll get going now.

546
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Sure.

547
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:57,093
- Here you go.
- Yes.

548
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,012
Let's have a look.

549
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,731
That greedy old Yeom
must be fuming over getting nothing.

550
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,402
After my wedding,
you two should get married.

551
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,073
You and Eunnam should get married.

552
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,288
You know what I want, don't you?

553
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,417
Yes, Chairman. I do.

554
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,713
A son with my last name
needs to inherit Daesan.

555
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,340
Only then will I be able

556
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:39,051
to face my father,
Chairman Cha Daebok, after I die.

557
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,138
Marry Eunnam as soon as possible.

558
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,516
Until Seonu is ready to lead Daesan,

559
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,352
you need to protect
both him and his mother…

560
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,647
as my grandson-in-law.

561
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,764
<i>Daesan now belongs to you,</i>

562
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,641
<i>Cha Seonu.</i>

563
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,814
VICE CHAIRMAN CHOI GIHYEON'S
INAUGURATION CEREMONY

564
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,650
OPENING DECLARATION

565
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,117
Vice Chairman Choi Gihyeon.

566
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,038
Do you like it?

567
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,122
Hey, Director Seo.

568
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,376
I told you
I could just do a short online greeting…

569
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,045
It's your inauguration.
It should be done properly.

570
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,256
The heads
of all affiliates will be attending.

571
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,466
Director Seo.

572
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,177
Could you help us finalize
the seating assignments?

573
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,929
Sure. Well, then.

574
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,348
Director Seo.

575
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,141
Let's grab a drink later.

576
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,726
All right.

577
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,318
I'll do it for you.

578
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,574
But seriously, can we keep downing
these shots like this?

579
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,454
Vice Chairman, are you ignoring
the authority I hold over these bottles?

580
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,873
Okay, fine. Let's do it.

581
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,250
Congratulations!

582
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,794
Cheers!

583
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,339
Just keep going straight up
to the chairman's seat next.

584
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,050
What? Manager Hong,

585
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,011
are you drunk?

586
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:48,222
If Chairman Cha hears you…
I haven't even taken office yet.

587
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:51,600
He's trying to get me fired
before I even become Vice Chairman.

588
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,102
Aren't you?

589
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,855
You must be a spy from Daesan Energy.

590
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,732
You're being suspicious.

591
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,651
Who invited this guy?
I didn't invite him. Who did?

592
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,070
I did. I thought
he could work as a double agent.

593
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,072
- A double agent?
- A double agent?

594
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,743
Well… How did you know
I'm good at living a double life?

595
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,329
I have a knack for spotting that talent.

596
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,581
Sure. He knows everything.

597
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,875
Don't even think about lying.

598
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,294
Here,
try the shots from the double agent!

599
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,796
<i>I found an article
about Yeo Sunho's car accident.</i>

600
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,964
Give me your glasses.

601
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,176
- Yes, gather your glasses.
- Yes, give me.

602
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:35,936
The newspaper wouldn't allow photos,
but I could make copies, so I got a few.

603
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,735
{\an8}TRUCK CRASHES INTO 2 CARS AND FLEES.
3 DEAD, 1 CRITICALLY INJURED

604
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:47,615
From Gyeonggi to Incheon…
I even checked Chuncheon just in case.

605
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,117
Only <i>Gyeonggi Agricultural News</i>
covered it.

606
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,869
It was too small of a newspaper.

607
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,121
Chairman Cha's reach didn't extend here.

608
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,040
Mr. Huh survived alone.

609
00:47:56,123 --> 00:48:00,628
Whether Eunnam's claim is true or not,
one thing is certain.

610
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:04,090
Huh Ildo was at the scene.

611
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,033
Honey.

612
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,369
About Father's marriage…

613
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,956
Even if you had opposed it,
he would've gone through with it anyway.

614
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,000
Just make sure
Taeyun doesn't feel unsettled.

615
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,048
Honey.

616
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,362
I was worried about
how my son would get along

617
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,157
with his much older siblings and in-laws,

618
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,910
but I'm relieved to have met
Seonu's eldest brother-in-law

619
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:15,995
separately like this.

620
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,317
MR. YEOM

621
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,615
You're not upset, are you?

622
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,117
Just trust me.

623
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:58,245
I even got the baker's son on our side,
the one you were most worried about.

624
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,372
Taking over Daesan
is only a matter of time.

625
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,460
Ji Yeongsu will be your solid ally.

626
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,386
KANG SEONG

627
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,223
Yes, Seong.

628
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,600
<i>Ildo, are you free tomorrow?</i>

629
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,185
<i>Let's meet.</i>

630
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,680
I'm sorry for calling so early.

631
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,765
It's Seo Dongju.

632
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,248
It's on me today.
Just the drinks, not the food.

633
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,675
I wanted to meet because I feel guilty.
I feel even worse for Deokhui.

634
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,762
Let her know that I'm sorry.

635
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,806
For what?

636
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,435
Well…

637
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,103
I should've just sent it to you.

638
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,565
But after sending the photo to Deokhui,

639
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,943
I realized the photo
was taken the day of the accident.

640
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:58,115
Sunho, Gyeongwon, her child, and even you.

641
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,756
This glass is too small
for me to get drunk.

642
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,975
I see a doll bobbing its head.

643
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,854
What color is it?

644
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,524
Black.

645
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,611
No, white.

646
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,657
The child is crying.

647
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,243
Why is the child crying?

648
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,664
He needs to drive,

649
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,376
but he can't.

650
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:02,012
You're still…

651
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:03,806
confused.

652
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,728
I have something to show you.

653
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,189
<i>Sir.</i>

654
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,984
<i>Please help me.</i>

655
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,488
<i>Sir.</i>

656
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,074
<i>Please help me.</i>

657
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,328
<i>Don't do it.</i>

658
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,747
<i>Don't do it!</i>

659
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,760
What kind of dream
would leave me that terrified?

660
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,012
That day, under hypnosis,

661
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,474
out of the one driving,
the one in the passenger seat,

662
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,226
and the child in the back,

663
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,606
you couldn't identify
which one was you and fell asleep.

664
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:56,650
So…

665
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,528
I finally remembered
everything in my dream?

666
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,990
Based on the video,

667
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:07,411
you spoke and acted like the child.

668
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,874
If you become the child in the back seat,

669
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,626
we might find the missing piece.

670
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:28,307
That night, after I left you guys,
I went after Sunho's car.

671
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,684
Why were you following Sunho's car?

672
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:33,103
I had something
to say to Sunho and Gyeongwon.

673
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,899
It's pouring.

674
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,443
You see a dog-shaped doll.

675
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,322
And the child is asleep
in the back seat, right?

676
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,366
No.

677
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,163
<i>He's looking at the dog-shaped doll.</i>

678
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:56,251
He must be looking at
the stuffed dog in the front seat.

679
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,670
No.

680
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,216
<i>The doll…</i>

681
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,011
<i>is in the car behind us.</i>

682
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,511
<i>A truck slammed
into my car from behind,</i>

683
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:30,846
<i>then hit Sunho's car and took off.</i>

684
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,183
Both our cars went over the cliff.

685
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:41,023
Damn that truck driver.
He's a murderer.

686
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,497
Mom.

687
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,542
Mom!

688
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,048
<i>Mom and Dad passed out.</i>

689
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,927
The car's about to fall off the guardrail.

690
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,520
<i>The man from the car behind
is trying to save us.</i>

691
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,107
Sir.

692
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,817
Sir.

{\an8}YEO SUNHO AND CHU SEONGHYEON
ARE BIOLOGICALLY RELATED

696
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,236
They're leaving…

697
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:11,655
the rest to you.

698
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,301
Sir!

699
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,387

Sir!

701
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,436
The door isn't opening!

702
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,022
Sir!

703
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,108
Help me!

704
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,197
Sir!

705
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,492
Sir!

706
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,682
Sir!

707
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,977
Sir!

Sir!

709
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,034
Sir, please save me!

710
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,745
I'm crying

711
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,290
and begging him to save me.

712
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,792
<i>Sir!</i>

713
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,044
Please save me!

714
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,087
<i>Sir!</i>

00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,801

<i>Please help me!</i>

717
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:26,975
No, don't do it.

718
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,315
Don't do it!

719
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,861
No!

720
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,593
That man…

721
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,056
killed us all.

722
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,100
