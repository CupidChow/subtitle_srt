00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,205
Buried Hearts

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,920
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,965
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,473
Die, you bastard!

5
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,876
<i>Of course you're having nightmares,</i>

6
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>with that awful thing
stashed under your bed.</i>

7
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,280
You're right.

8
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,866
Why are you even keeping that?

9
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,243
I know, right?

10
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,954
Even if you call it a trophy...

11
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,124
or a symbol of victory,

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,460
it's dangerous.

13
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,339
And it doesn't suit you.

14
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,636
You were almost killed by those guns.

15
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,430
Get rid of them.

16
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,018
It's time to let me go too.

17
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,523
You won.

18
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,236
Did I win?

19
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,279
You won.

20
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,616
All that's left is...

21
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,619
to be happy with Eunnam now.

22
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,141
{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

23
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,986
Welcome.

24
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,448
Would you like to order?

25
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,718
Yes.

26
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,807
Yes, I understand, Assemblyman Nam.

27
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,023
Assemblyman Nam Sangcheol
said to wait and not worry.

28
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,733
He saw him get into the Elder's car

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,027
and saw him off
right outside the hospital.

30
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,613
It's been more than
enough time to go back and forth

31
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,573
from here to the hospital five times.

32
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,326
We should report it to the police.

33
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,619
Professor wouldn't like that, ma'am.

34
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,498
If something happens to him,
are you taking responsibility?

35
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,584
Wait, hold on...

36
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,504
<i>It's been a month
since Professor Yeom Jangseon</i>

37
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>of Hanguk University Law School vanished.</i>

38
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,427
<i>There have been no signs of life
or activity from Professor Yeom.</i>

39
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,933
<i>Prosecutors have suspended
the indictment against Professor Yeom.</i>

40
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,811
<i>It means the case is on hold
because the suspect or witness</i>

41
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,062
<i>can't be located.</i>

42
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,733
<i>Once they're found,
the investigation resumes.</i>

43
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,861
<i>And the decision to suspend the indictment</i>

44
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,282
<i>shows the prosecution's determination
to pursue the case.</i>

45
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,244
You've worked hard, Vice-Chairman.

46
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,204
If it weren't for you,

47
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,041
we couldn't have overcome
the mess Yeom caused.

48
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,587
It was only possible because
you're still standing, Chairman.

49
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,090
With today's emergency
shareholders' meeting,

50
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,135
no issues with appointing Dongju
as CEO of Daesan Energy?

51
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,265
No, sir. Most of the expected shareholders
have already expressed support.

52
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,643
Even CEO Cha Gukhui backed down
after you stepped in,

53
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,853
so it all wrapped up smoothly.

54
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,648
We should've reined Gukhui in sooner.

55
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,859
Director Seo went through trouble
he didn't need to.

56
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,321
Visiting every institutional investor
one by one...

57
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,363
Not at all.

58
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,909
Competing with her actually helped me.

59
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,119
Is that so?

60
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,247
What's the agenda
for this morning's meeting?

61
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,377
Right. It's the proposed merger between
Daesan Energy and Daesan Chemical.

62
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,420
What?

63
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,967
The idea is to integrate the two
and expand our business scope.

64
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,927
If we channel the combined strength

65
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,222
into Daesan Volt,
Daesan Energy's subsidiary,

66
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,185
I think we'll be able to take it public
within three years.

67
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,354
Mmm.

68
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,396
Bring me the detailed plan.

69
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,857
Yes, Chairman.

70
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,985
Gukhui's going to flip
when she hears about this.

71
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,445
I'll talk to her.

72
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,529
All right.

73
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,076
And there's one person who absolutely
needs to be at today's meeting.

74
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,579
Most shareholders have already confirmed.
Who else?

75
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,665
Yeom.

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,462
Professor Yeom Jangseon has been
out of contact for over a month...

77
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,257
Director Seo stopped Mr. Yeom from
snatching up Daesan Energy for free.

78
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,635
Now I just want to see
the look on his face

79
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,430
when Director Seo is named CEO.

80
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,182
I didn't expect him to be this petty.

81
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,686
Hiding out to dodge an investigation?

82
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,355
Rumors are flying, Chairman.

83
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,147
What rumors?

84
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,108
That his disappearance isn't staged.

85
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,945
Some say he may have been killed
since he had many enemies.

86
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,572
It's all over the internet.

87
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,950
Enemies?

88
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,577
No one's suffered more than Director Seo
because of Yeom.

89
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,163
Even after everything,
he was still holding back.

90
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,791
So who beat him to the punch?

91
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,796
Professor Yeom Jangseon's absence
is a huge blow.

92
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:29,758
The shareholders who were backing me
have all switched to Seo Dongju.

93
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,595
Something must've happened to him.

94
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,307
Not hearing from him for a whole month?
That's not normal.

95
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,184
You don't think

96
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,979
he cut off contact with you

97
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,773
on purpose, do you?

98
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,900
What makes you say that?

99
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,570
Maybe he's switching sides.

100
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,406
From Cha Seonu...

101
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,324
to Huh Taeyun.

102
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,370
My brother-in-law, President Huh Ildo,

103
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,835
rose through the ranks at Daesan
thanks to Mr. Yeom's political backing.

104
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,794
And Taeyun...

105
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,297
He's President Huh's son.

106
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,842
Sure, Professor Yeom could change sides.

107
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,388
But once the chairman passes,

108
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,059
Seonu and I will inherit his shares

109
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,936
and become the largest shareholders
of Daesan Group.

110
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,314
Don't forget that.

111
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,733
Aunt.

112
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,902
Yes?

113
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,406
Why do you two look so sneaky?
Like you're plotting something.

114
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,244
We were just saying how great it is that
you're now on the board of Daesan Energy.

115
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,123
<i>Grandfather, you're not
gonna take back what you said, right?</i>

116
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,335
In return,
you must help Seonu in the future.

117
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:50,339
That's the condition for putting you
on the board of Daesan Energy.

118
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,093
Plus, Director Seo gave you
a strong recommendation.

119
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,847
Eunnam, you've built up
a lot of hands-on experience.

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,018
It's time to take on
more responsibility as an executive.

121
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,854
Congrats, Eunnam.

122
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,903
DAESAN ENERGY CEO CANDIDATE
SEO DONGJU

123
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:18,326
Director Seo Dongju
has been appointed CEO of Daesan Energy,

124
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,412
with 94.6% of shareholders in favor.

125
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,922
Now, let's hear a few words
from our new CEO.

126
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,511
I'm Seo Dongju,
the newly appointed CEO of Daesan Energy.

127
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:41,933
First, I want to thank the shareholders
who supported my appointment.

128
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,618
Former President Huh Ildo

129
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,164
dedicated the last several years
to strengthening

130
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,792
our global competitiveness
through sustainable management.

131
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,046
To build on this vision
of sustainable management,

132
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,966
I plan to increase investment

133
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:20,889
in low-carbon, green innovation,
the direction Daesan Energy is aiming for.

134
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,602
I also want to talk
about business expansion.

135
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:31,148
Going forward, we'll work closely
with Daesan Group's energy affiliates

136
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,485
to align and strengthen our capabilities.

137
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,695
We'll start by

138
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,117
merging Daesan Energy and Daesan Chemical
to launch a new entity called Daesan E&C.

139
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,996
Furthermore, we'll boldly take
every step necessary to help Daesan Group

140
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,542
grow into
a leading global green energy company.

141
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,725
Ms. Cha.

142
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,730
I understand that the merger
may be unavoidable, but you can't just...

143
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,566
bring up the merger so publicly...

144
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,401
Bringing it up publicly

145
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,528
will spark investor interest
in the stock market

146
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,031
around the merger potential.

147
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:21,990
That could lead

148
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,535
to a more favorable merger ratio
for Daesan Chemical.

149
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,080
Most importantly, Ms. Cha,

150
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,416
I hope you cut ties
with outside forces like Professor Yeom

151
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,253
and grow Daesan

152
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,380
with your own merits.

153
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,007
What do you mean, cut ties?

154
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,386
I never teamed up with Professor Yeom.

155
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,023
PROFESSOR YEOM JANGSEON
MISSING FOR ONE MONTH

156
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,836
Congrats.

157
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,963
Congrats to Director Yeo too.

158
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,715
Thanks.

159
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,719
What is it?

160
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,303
What?

161
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,139
What do you want to ask me?

162
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,564
Is Mr. Yeom...

163
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:36,899
dead?

164
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,407
Some say it was a staged disappearance.

165
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,202
And the vice-chairman said that
there are even posts online saying

166
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,913
he might've been murdered
since he had many enemies.

167
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,499
Did you kill him?

168
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,252
Dongju.

169
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,629
What if I killed him?

170
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,015
Good job.

171
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,392
I understand.

172
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,772
No matter how many enemies Mr. Yeom has,
you're at the top of that list.

173
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,318
If anyone was going to kill him,
it should've been you.

174
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,824
Good job.

175
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,119
Good job.

176
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,132
You knew

177
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,259
I supported CEO Cha Gukhui,

178
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,470
so why did you take Director Seo's side?

179
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:54,519
Gukhui is a girl who tried to shine
like a son in the sonless Cha family.

180
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,604
She never had
natural strength from the start,

181
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,233
so in the end,
her desperation always shows.

182
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,194
She's too weak
to look after Seonu down the line.

183
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,072
Part of it's my fault
she turned out that way.

184
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,075
For always wanting a son instead.

185
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,829
If you'd taken us in earlier,

186
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,124
you would've felt more secure with Seonu.

187
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,752
You might've been kinder
to Deokhui and Gukhui too.

188
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,088
Of course.

189
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,631
Deokhui was so fierce.

190
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,677
I've wasted all those years
walking on eggshells.

191
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,017
Hey.

192
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,437
Here comes the one who pushed me
past my doubts about Deokhui.

193
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,817
I was discussing the merger
with CEO Cha Gukhui, Chairman.

194
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,610
Gukhui seemed pretty upset.

195
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,656
Yes. But I got her to promise
to continue the conversation.

196
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,950
Congratulations, Director Seo.

197
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,244
He's President Seo now.

198
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,329
President Seo.

199
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,374
Please guide me well.

200
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,503
When the chairman is gone
and it's just me and Seonu,

201
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,714
I don't want to be
a clueless major shareholder

202
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,592
who just holds inherited stock.

203
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,343
Seonu is still young.

204
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,890
So I want to be
the strongest support he has.

205
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,642
That's why

206
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,313
you encouraged
my marriage so actively, President Seo.

207
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,489
Dongju, you're here too.

208
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,491
Where were you?

209
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,410
Just looking around.

210
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,328
Even in restricted areas,

211
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,373
they let me through
when I said I was the chairman's son.

212
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,631
Dongju.

213
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,219
The secret vault they mentioned
on the news, it's real, right?

214
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,723
Daesan Group officials say
there's no such thing at all,

215
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,434
but I think it really exists.

216
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,145
If it does exist, that'd be so cool.

217
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,733
This kid...

218
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,361
He keeps up with everything.

219
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,448
Show him where it is.

220
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,914
Yes, Chairman.

221
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,091
Wow, this is so cool.

222
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,893
That's the vault.

223
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,104
Open it, Dongju.

224
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,856
Open it.

225
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,240
Father. I want to see inside the vault.

226
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,450
Please open it.

227
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,076
Right.

228
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,870
Just give him a peek.

229
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,206
Don't let him go inside.

230
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,874
Yes.

231
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,441
That's all money?

232
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,277
Don't go in.

233
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,821
You'll get in when the time's right.

234
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
Dongju.

235
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,032
When will I get to know
the vault password?

236
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,577
It's your father's. He will tell you.

237
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,955
- Seonu.
- Yes, Father.

238
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,583
To know the password,

239
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,253
you have to be capable
of leading Daesan Group.

240
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,214
Okay.

241
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,219
You're going to help Seonu
become someone truly capable, right?

242
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,894
Yes, Chairman.

243
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,575
<i>I've decided to back
Director Seo</i>

244
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,205
for CEO at the upcoming
Daesan Energy shareholders' meeting.

245
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,500
I need you to support him too, Taeyun.

246
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,585
Mom.

247
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,462
Weren't you backing Aunt?

248
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,341
You matter far more to me than my sister.

249
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,845
I'd do anything for you, Taeyun.

250
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,556
So, Taeyun,

251
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,227
don't back down

252
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,814
and don't let Cha Seonu intimidate you.

253
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,899
Got it?

254
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,070
I pretty much...

255
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,114
stopped coming up here

256
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,034
after President Huh
chewed me out for pushing you

257
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,996
back when we were kids.

258
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,875
Did you really push me back then?

259
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,128
I probably wanted to.

260
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,299
Mom, President Huh, Grandfather,
even Secretary Gong...

261
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,177
They all only adored you.

262
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,763
Always fussing over "our precious son."

263
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,811
But...

264
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,023
not this place. It's way too dangerous.

265
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,277
If I'd pushed you from here,
do you think you'd still be alive?

266
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,699
I never pushed you.

267
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,869
I know.

268
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,040
Then why did you act like
you remembered being pushed?

269
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,875
When we were little,

270
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,336
you screamed,

271
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,923
"You killed my dad, Mom!

272
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,384
You planned it with President Huh!"

273
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,638
Am I remembering it right?

274
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,183
You are.

275
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,732
But I misunderstood.

276
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,653
I twisted things
that I heard when I was little.

277
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,907
When Mom scolded me,
I said it to win the argument.

278
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,830
It's freezing out here.

279
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,331
I'm going in.

280
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,988
Shoot.

281
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,034
You scared me! I pushed you as a joke,
but you actually almost fell.

282
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,245
Taeyun,

283
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,289
you should work on those legs.

284
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:22,150
I could've come alone.
You didn't have to make time for this.

285
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,612
I had stuff to take care of too.

286
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:29,700
I'll fight the hospital that framed you
like it's my own case.

287
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,913
By the way, who recommended this place?

288
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,498
- Remember Dr. Park, who treated us?
- Yes.

289
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,461
He recommended this firm,
saying it has a great track record

290
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,962
with medical lawsuits.

291
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,300
That it may be a small firm,
but they're good at what they do.

292
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,095
If the picky doctor
vouched for them, I trust it.

293
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,057
But why isn't anyone coming?

294
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,734
Don't tell me this bastard is...

295
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,611
Do you know him?

296
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,118
I'm Attorney Yeom Huicheol
from Law Firm Soyul.

297
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,205
Hello, I'm Bae Wonbae.

298
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,634
Hey, punk.

299
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,928
Are you not leaving?

300
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,765
What a joke...
Can't you see I'm here as a client?

301
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,393
If you have a problem, you leave.

302
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,147
- Mr. Bae Wonbae.
- Yes.

303
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,816
- I'm confident about this case,
- Yes.

304
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,278
But I can't work
with this punk in the same room.

305
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,491
A petty bastard until the end.

306
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,409
Hey, take your time.

307
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,120
- Dongju.
- I'll leave.

308
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,204
This is so messed up.

309
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,289
Hey.

310
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,624
Take this.

311
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,876
Stuff it yourself.

312
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,046
What's wrong? Where
are you going? Dongju...

313
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,133
Excuse me.

314
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,469
God damn it.

315
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
Hey, punk.

316
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,517
What? You told me to leave, so I did.

317
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,770
Well...

318
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,815
Chief Cheon Guho said my uncle...

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,486
Never mind.

320
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,323
Asking you anything is useless.
You'd just throw attitude.

321
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,409
Forget it. Go.

322
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,911
How's Professor Yeom Chiseon these days?

323
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,912
What about my father?

324
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,540
Back when I got kicked out of school,

325
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:46,378
only your dad said it was mutual assault
and that we should be punished equally.

326
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,423
So I think of him from time to time.

327
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,094
If your uncle hadn't stepped in
and just let your dad handle it...

328
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,685
maybe you wouldn't have turned out to be
such a pathetic loser.

329
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,564
- You little... I ought to!
- What?

330
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,609
Fair point.

331
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,194
Hey.

332
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,031
I can keep this from leading to an arrest.
So don't follow Mr. Bae around.

333
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:19,036
Just seeing your damn face
ruins my luck for the next ten years.

334
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,206
Go.

335
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,632
You two start cursing each other out
the second you meet.

336
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,344
We're both pretty committed
when it comes to insults.

337
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,431
That bastard Yeom Huicheol
is so eager to one-up me,

338
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,475
so I'm sure he'll get you cleared.

339
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,394
He does seem calm and competent.

340
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,356
- Should I drop you off at the office?
- Yes.

341
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,526
I wanted to take the day off
to at least grab a meal with you...

342
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,945
Yeom Jangseon's disappearance,

343
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,780
was it your doing, Dongju?

344
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,712
Chairman.

345
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,303
I'm here to report on
the Daesan Energy purchase.

346
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,098
I'm here to update on the merger progress.

347
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,643
He called earlier, scolding me
about my report being late.

348
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,770
Where did he go?

349
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,826
The chairman said he had somewhere to go.

350
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,078
He drove himself.

351
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,249
I think I know where he went.
Let's go, Eunnam.

352
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,011
Isn't it better
to call the police right now?

353
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,389
If we keep going, we'll spot his car soon.

354
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,101
That's crazy.
I've never even seen Grandfather drive.

355
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,106
Let's just call the police
and ask them to track his car.

356
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,068
Wait! That's his car up ahead!

357
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,240
He's probably in the best mood right now.
Let's not ruin it.

358
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,841
Why's he driving so well?

359
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,886
Because he's excited.

360
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:14,002
He always drove
all the way out here by himself?

361
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,341
Even when he brought me here,
he wouldn't let me drive.

362
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,718
How long is he planning to wait?

363
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,601
Until Seonu
walks out with the bread he just baked.

364
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,855
Until Ms. Ji acts like
she doesn't know the chairman.

365
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,158
Grandfather saw us.

366
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,205
We locked eyes.

367
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,808
- Director Seo.
- Yes.

368
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,559
You can drive.

369
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,019
Yes, sir.

370
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,313
And you can get the bill. For everything.

371
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,946
<i>It's now been a year since
Professor Yeom Jangseon went missing.</i>

372
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,866
<i>According to police,
a petition from his family</i>

373
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,786
<i>has led to the reward being tripled.</i>

374
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,372
<i>With rumors of it being real or staged,</i>

375
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,043
<i>interest in the case
has faded over the past year,</i>

376
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:42,173
<i>prompting the family to raise the reward
in hopes of finding him.</i>

377
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:47,136
<i>Last December, Professor Yeom Jangseon
was indicted for instigating murder,</i>

378
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,931
<i>but the court rejected the arrest warrant,
citing no clear risk</i>

379
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,392
<i>of evidence tampering or flight.</i>

380
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,936
<i>But the dismissal of the warrant...</i>

381
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,025
{\an8}PRESIDENT SEO DONGJU

382
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,166
I'm late again.

383
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,669
I was trying to beat you in today.

384
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,838
Where's President Seo?

385
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,175
He's here.

386
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,804
You're here.

387
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,765
Is the Daesan Volt
R&D team fully staffed yet?

388
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,309
Still adjusting salary offers.

389
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:39,523
We got the attendee list
for the Yuseong Chemical merger hearing.

390
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:44,235
Since we're doing this without
any political interference like Mr. Yeom,

391
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,653
it might take time...

392
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,364
We just need to be patient.

393
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,496
Ever since you became CEO of Daesan Volt,

394
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,958
your expression during meetings with me
has improved.

395
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:03,130
Maybe I'm in a better mood
now that Daesan Volt might go public.

396
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,926
So, have you given up on pushing me out
and taking over as CEO of Daesan E&C?

397
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,972
I'm still gunning for it.
Every minute, every second...

398
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,558
Just waiting for you to slip up.

399
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,273
Chief Cheon.

400
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,775
As of today, you're dismissed.

401
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,696
I've included a generous severance
and retirement package.

402
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,198
- Ma'am...
- Every day for a year...

403
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,492
Even if

404
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,744
Professor Yeom returns,

405
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,706
he won't hold it against you.

406
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,835
Ma'am. We must keep searching for him.

407
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,044
Chief Cheon.

408
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,797
When people his age

409
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,758
live past a certain point,

410
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,344
it's just borrowed time.

411
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,388
The professor...

412
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,307
lived enough.

413
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,687
Then why did you raise the reward?

414
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,065
Because people are watching.

415
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,154
People need to know his family's still...

416
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,031
waiting for him.

417
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,825
If he's alive...

418
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,748
seeing that reward go up
might give him the will to return.

419
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,698
I won't ask you to come by again.

420
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,326
I just wanted

421
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:57,994
to feed you once.

422
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,332
Thanks for eating so well,
just like you used to.

423
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,211
Even when you were a kid,
you liked pollack soup like a grown-up.

424
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,256
Did I?

425
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,342
Maybe I like it

426
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,970
because I had it here when I was little.

427
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,014
The reason...

428
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,684
I ignored you all this time...

429
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,396
It wasn't
because the professor told me to.

430
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,108
When I heard
you were raised with your nun sister,

431
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,777
I thought I'd just let you live your life.

432
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,197
No need to stir things up
by acting familiar.

433
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,371
There was some training

434
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,831
and no one to watch the kid.

435
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,919
So Professor Yeom
brought you and your mom here.

436
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,006
You loved

437
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,259
this <i>hanok house.</i>

438
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,429
Even when I came back as an adult,

439
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,223
I loved it.

440
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,060
You said you'd go see your dad
when your mom came back.

441
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,939
You wondered if your dad
would recognize you, what he'd look like,

442
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,609
what he did for a living,

443
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,402
and what candy he liked...

444
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,031
We'd play games, making up answers.

445
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:21,870
I never imagined...

446
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,790
it'd take that long
for you to meet your father.

447
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:33,400
<i>In the end, you're just another
goldfish eagerly opening its mouth,</i>

448
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,903
<i>desperate for every scrap
of food tossed its way.</i>

449
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,488
<i>No matter how high you climb,</i>

450
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:44,035
the best you can hope for
is being the first in line to get fed.

451
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,080
That's where your story ends.

452
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,397
Director Seo.

453
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,196
Yes.

454
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,616
This is the last of our tea leaves.

455
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,036
We're moving, so I didn't stock up.

456
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,049
I'm turning this place
into a kindergarten.

457
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,510
"Kindergarten of Overflow."

458
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,681
A kindergarten
overflowing with clear water.

459
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,767
To me,

460
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,020
this house was at its brightest

461
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,356
when you, Seonghyeon,
were running around here.

462
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,902
So I want to fill it
with more kids like you back then.

463
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,863
Ah.

464
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,032
Here's the photo
you were meant to come back for.

465
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,493
I'm finally giving it to you.

466
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,000
It's us.

467
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,545
The day we took this,
you held your mom's hand and said...

468
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,463
- Mom.
- Yes?

469
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,757
Let's come back tomorrow.

470
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,342
"Let's come back tomorrow."

471
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,470
I remember it so vividly.

472
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,017
Do you remember your mom?

473
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,771
Not at all.

474
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,357
Seonghyeon...

475
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:39,901
I mean, Director Seo.

476
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,781
Your mother cherished and treasured you.

477
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,576
I want to tell you everything
I saw and heard.

478
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,746
But there's no time
to tell you everything.

479
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,165
There's one thing

480
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,085
I want you to remember.

481
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,673
While raising you alone,

482
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,218
she was so desperate for money,

483
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,888
she almost took the wrong path.

484
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:14,477
But when she thought of you,
she caught herself and declined the offer.

485
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,481
You were a son

486
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,942
to a mother like that.

487
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,903
When life gets hard,

488
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,073
I hope you'll remember
the mother I told you about...

489
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,537
and keep going, Director Seo.

490
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,709
I will.

491
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,320
Seo Dongju, you bastard.

492
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,465
What...

493
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,926
You woke up earlier than expected.

494
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,095
You bastard...

495
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,722
You bastard...

496
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,612
There's a bathroom behind that curtain.

497
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,658
It was a hassle to get it installed,
so make good use of it.

498
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,910
You'll get burgers for meals.

499
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,287
I'll sometimes get you some fruits.

500
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,958
For water,
you can use the tap water from the sink.

501
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,670
I installed a pull-up bar inside,
so stay in shape.

502
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,716
And the temperature and humidity
are kept constant, so it might feel cold.

503
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,969
I recommend you take one of the jackets

504
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,721
prepared in the bathroom.

505
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,057
You crazy bastard. What the hell is this?

506
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,103
It's me locking you up in Daesan's vault.

507
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,691
You gave me the chance
earlier than I planned,

508
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,528
so I had to act sooner.

509
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,363
What are you trying to do

510
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,198
by locking me up?

511
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,075
What do you want?

512
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,957
Just tell me!

513
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,252
What do you want?

514
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,546
Hey!

515
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,756
It's a <i>hanbok.</i>

516
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,801
I was invited to
House of Overflow for a meal recently.

517
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,429
Being there

518
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,351
reminded me of when you used
to wear <i>hanbok,</i> so I brought one for you.

519
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:36,484
You must've met my wife.

520
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,486
Seo Dongju.

521
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,240
You're not planning
to keep me here until I die.

522
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,076
Just tell me what you want.

523
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,705
Lying in bed last night,

524
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,833
this thought hit me.

525
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,837
I'm the only one
who knows the code to this vault.

526
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,215
So if I die,

527
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,344
Yeom Jangseon would rot away
in this vault and die a mummified corpse.

528
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,845
Is that what you want?

529
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,598
If it were,
I wouldn't bring you burgers every day.

530
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,101
So what?

531
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,523
What do you want?

532
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,235
You're not ready yet.

533
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,240
Until the day you beg me
a little more desperately,

534
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,325
I'll wait.

535
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,746
It's money that you want, isn't it?

536
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,128
You said
my life wasn't even worth killing.

537
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,549
Remember that tall building
where you got waterboarded?

538
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,884
I'll give it to you, so let me go.

539
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,805
A year in here is enough time served.

540
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,563
Hey, you bastard!

541
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,024
What do you want?

542
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,567
Tell me.

543
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,319
How much do you want?

544
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,529
Everything.

545
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,364
What?

546
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
Everything of what?

547
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,243
Your entire fortune.

548
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,038
You're really pushing it now.

549
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,749
<i>He's the one who shot me.</i>

550
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,377
If he shot you,
you should've just let him drown.

551
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,588
Why did you save him?

552
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,840
To get my revenge.

553
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,845
In that brief moment,
my goal to get revenge became clear.

554
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,515
It's never changed since.

555
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,102
I'm going to take everything

556
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,439
Huh Ildo and Yeom Jangseon ever had,
down to the last piece.

557
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,902
I'd rather bite my tongue and die here
than hand it all over to you.

558
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,072
Then you'll walk away with nothing.

559
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,242
That wouldn't be so bad either.

560
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,128
Pray I don't get into an accident
and that I keep bringing you burgers.

561
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,338
If you don't want to starve to death.

562
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,176
You're the cruelest,
most vicious bastard I've ever met.

563
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,522
Hey!

564
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,652
I'd rather die at home.

565
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,492
What do I have to do?

566
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,207
What made you reach out first?

567
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,751
Sir.

568
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:46,382
Now I can't hand over a single penny
from the National Patriotism Fund.

569
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,346
You're saying you'll keep...

570
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,683
the two trillion won for yourself?

571
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,811
Yes.

572
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,106
Don't worry.

573
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:07,069
It'll be put to far better use
than serving you.

574
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,451
<i>On Yeom Jangseon's computer,</i>

575
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:18,329
<i>he had your crimes,
and those of everyone connected to you,</i>

576
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,166
<i>neatly organized.</i>

577
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:25,170
{\an8}<i>And I hacked it
and handed it to someone else.</i>

578
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,964
{\an8}NATIONAL PATRIOTISM FUND
TRANSACTION HISTORY

579
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,596
Jangseon, that bastard...

580
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,974
If you threaten me or Daesan Group,

581
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:41,187
your corruption will be
exposed to the world.

582
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,113
Can I ask you

583
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,823
an important question?

584
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:57,661
You strike me

585
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,914
as someone who believes

586
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,916
in serving the people

587
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,711
with sincerity, not with money.

588
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,340
What happened to you?

589
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,597
I handed everything over
to Jeil Real Estate Trust.

590
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:22,645
All the properties Yeom Jangseon donated.
Sales, leases, even mortgage loans.

591
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,857
They said they'll handle each one
in the most reasonable way.

592
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,443
{\an8}DONATOR YEOM JANGSEON

593
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:33,948
But Dongju,

594
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:40,329
how did you get Yeom Jangseon
to sign over his entire fortune?

595
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,545
Okay. Talk to you later, then.

596
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,342
He doesn't want to talk about it.

597
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,680
I shouldn't have asked.

598
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,235
PRESIDENT SEO DONGJU

599
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,235
{\an8}KINDERGARTEN OF OVERFLOW

600
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,905
Let's go home.

601
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:46,992
- Let's go home!
- We're going home!

602
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,168
Hey, give me the cab fare already.

603
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,213
Just hold on. I will pay you.

604
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:03,216
Seriously, I came all the way here.

605
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,719
What are you, a beggar or something?

606
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,017
I'm...

607
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,354
Yeom Jangseon.

608
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,694
Dongju.

609
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,740
Yes, Taeyun.

610
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,867
Are you okay?

611
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:30,910
You look unwell.

612
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,663
I'm just feeling tired.

613
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,706
Have a seat.

614
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,923
What brings you here?

615
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,219
Dongju.

616
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,430
It's been half a year
since I started working at Daesan Volt.

617
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,516
Yeah.

618
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,894
I feel like it's not the right fit for me.

619
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,732
That's understandable.

620
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,194
But, Taeyun,

621
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,239
you know

622
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:11,785
better than anyone
how much President Huh wanted you

623
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,079
to settle in at Daesan.

624
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,750
Just hang in there a little longer.

625
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:21,962
If it still doesn't feel right

626
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,298
and you make your decision,

627
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,134
I'll fully support it.

628
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,392
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

629
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,937
Yes, Grandfather.

630
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,106
Yes.

631
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,982
Right.

632
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,943
Yes, got it.

633
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,072
He said he couldn't reach you.

634
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,868
I was going to call him later.

635
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,246
Wait, Taeyun.

636
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,999
The chairman just recognized you.

637
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,170
You know he has days
when he recognizes me.

638
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,840
He told me to find you and bring you over.

639
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:08,592
Please hurry.

640
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,765
The chairman said
he'd eat once you got here,

641
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,184
so everyone's waiting.

642
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,977
Okay.

643
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,151
Chairman, I'm here.

644
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,279
Yes, President Seo.

645
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,531
Sit down and eat.

646
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,784
Okay.

647
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,875
You must be...

648
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,502
Taeyun.

649
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,087
Right?

650
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:46,838
Your father is...

651
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,050
Huh Ildo.

652
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,678
My daughter Deokhui is your mom.

653
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,638
Yes, she's right here.

654
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,974
Honey, you recognized me this morning too.

655
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,686
You're doing great today.

656
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:05,231
Father, Taeyun is working at Daesan Volt.

657
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,315
Really?

658
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,777
Good for him to learn
under his tough aunt.

659
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,614
Father, today you even remember Gukhui.

660
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,450
Father. Who am I?

661
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:22,206
You're the eldest grandson of
Daesan Group's founder, Cha Daebok,

662
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,751
and my son, Cha Seonu.

663
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,840
Chef Do.

664
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,049
Yes, Chairman.

665
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,219
President Seo's soup must've gone cold.
Bring him a fresh one.

666
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,304
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

667
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,101
Have some of this.

668
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,938
Secretary Gong.

669
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,357
Do you perhaps...

670
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,692
The chairman scolded you

671
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,445
for showing up without a tie, right?

672
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,658
Yes, I rushed out and
didn't even realize I wasn't wearing one.

673
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,409
Thank you.

674
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,913
Our sharp Secretary Gong grabbed a tie
the moment she saw you.

675
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,874
Gosh.

676
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,709
When I start my own place,

677
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,045
I'm going to wear a tie
in the kitchen too.

678
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,590
To honor the chairman.

679
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:14,009
Secretary Gong.

680
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,429
I think Chef Do wants a raise.

681
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:20,182
When did I say that? I just...

682
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,642
The chairman

683
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,896
doesn't recognize me or Ms. Kaesong,
but he always recognizes Chef Do.

684
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,523
I figured that alone...

685
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,650
was reason enough...

686
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,320
to give him a raise.

687
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,321
Secretary Gong...

688
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,241
Oh, my, honey. This is great!

689
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,998
Say that again.

690
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,877
Because of what you and Dad did,
I can barely breathe.

691
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,546
Mom.

692
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,508
If this keeps up, your beloved son...

693
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:56,510
might just die.

694
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,263
Don't you dare talk about dying!

695
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,187
Mom.

696
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,732
Every time you see Eunnam

697
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,276
and every time you face Dongju...

698
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,321
I know how hard
you fight to keep it together.

699
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,825
- And it's because of me.
- It is because of you!

700
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,166
To me,

701
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,002
you're the reason to live, Taeyun.

702
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,088
You hear me?

703
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,843
Mom.

704
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,220
Let's leave this house, leave Daesan.

705
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,389
To somewhere far away.

706
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,140
Let's live where no one knows us.

707
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,643
Taeyun!

708
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,645
Get a hold of yourself.

709
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,817
Learn everything you can at Daesan Volt.

710
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,697
You're going to keep moving forward
until you become its CEO.

711
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,993
I'll clear any obstacles
in your way for you.

712
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,328
That's my job now,
since your dad's not here.

713
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,413
Mom...

714
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,125
It's okay to whine like this
once in a while.

715
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,504
I'm sorry I hit you, my son.

716
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,052
I've come...

717
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,015
too far to turn back.

718
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,059
And...

719
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,352
the end's in sight.

720
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,646
Why would you walk away?

721
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,858
Only fools would do that, Taeyun.

722
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,485
Got it? Okay?

723
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,831
So once we bring in Yuseong Chemical...

724
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,042
What was it again? Daesan...

725
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,627
Daesan Energy.

726
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,213
Right. Daesan Energy
will grow several times over.

727
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,591
Yes, Chairman.

728
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,886
Director Yeo Eunnam
will handle the merger well.

729
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:09,976
Right.

730
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,189
You didn't forget.

731
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,651
It's fine. Just give it to me.

732
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:24,366
The flavor of a lollipop starts
when you unwrap it.

733
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,331
Mm.

734
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,379
I should promote Huh Ildo
to vice-chairman.

735
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,843
Gather feedback
on Huh Ildo from the subsidiaries.

736
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,307
Yes, Chairman.

737
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,647
<i>Chairman,</i>

738
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,274
<i>I'll be taking some time off soon.</i>

739
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,027
<i>It'll be longer...</i>

740
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,863
<i>than last time.</i>

741
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,449
What?

742
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,952
Do you want the lollipop?

743
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,079
No, sir.

744
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,888
INNER SAFE

745
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,934
So, Chairman Cha Daebok
and Chairman Cha Gangcheon,

746
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,060
then you,

747
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,273
and now I'm the fourth person
to know this code?

748
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,442
Yeah.

749
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:43,652
That's a lot of pressure.

750
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,071
The chairman said

751
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:50,826
only someone
capable of leading Daesan should know it.

752
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,911
Then it shouldn't be me.

753
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,164
Since Daesan E&C merged
with Yuseong Chemical,

754
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,083
the stock's been climbing nonstop.

755
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,919
That's because you made bold decisions
and saved it

756
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,090
every time the merger
was about to fall apart.

757
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,008
Eunnam.

758
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,386
You're capable enough
to know the vault code.

759
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:13,641
You praising me
makes me believe it might be true.

760
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,315
Wait.

761
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,069
You're not leaving Daesan, are you?

762
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,821
You're not, right?

763
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,948
Right?

764
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,036
Don't leave, Dongju.

765
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,623
I took what Yeom Jangseon cared about most

766
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,750
and let him live.

767
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,876
That's what I wanted.

768
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,587
Then that's a good thing, isn't it?

769
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,008
Do you think so?

770
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,680
I don't even know what's wrong anymore.

771
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,143
So I'm going to leave to find the answer.

772
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,006
I want to drive you.

773
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,926
If you say no, I won't let you leave.

774
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,110
Have a good trip.

775
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,267
Dongju!

776
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,251
Again.

777
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,466
How was studying business?

778
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:17,343
It was a bit tough.

779
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,555
All I'd done was play violin,
so it was like starting from scratch.

780
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:22,640
Mmm.

781
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,059
I've only been riding bikes
and just starting it too.

782
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,478
We're the same, nephew.

783
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,984
I'll get another coffee. Do you want more?

784
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,112
Come on, I'm younger,
so let me do it, nephew.

785
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,128
{\an8}DONGJU

786
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,856
There he is!

787
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,983
JI SEONU

788
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,535
<i>Dongju,
I heard you took some time off.</i>

789
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,871
<i>I'm talking to Seonu
about business school.</i>

790
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,667
<i>The more I know him, the more he seems
like a better fit for Daesan.</i>

791
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,407
<i>When I die of old age someday,</i>

792
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:49,203
scatter my ashes over the sea
right where you saved me.

793
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,206
<i>When I die,</i>

794
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,126
<i>I want to repent there.</i>

795
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,248
Buried Hearts

796
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,168
{\an8}- Father.
- Yeah.

797
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,078
<i>Dongju.</i>

798
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,455
<i>You don't have to come back for good.</i>

799
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,833
<i>Just come take a break.</i>

800
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,508
