00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,456
Buried Hearts

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,962
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,965
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,634
{\an8}EPISODE 2

5
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,142
{\an8}Can you give us a moment?

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,113
{\an8}Seeing you getting married

7
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,367
makes me feel like
I can finally face Sunho.

8
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,913
You couldn't face him until now?

9
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,168
You married your best friend's wife
right after he died.

10
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,257
So I didn't think you cared
about things like guilt or shame.

11
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,136
We just need to walk
down the aisle like this.

12
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,850
Just like you and my grandfather,

13
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,893
Chairman Cha Gangcheon, wanted,

14
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,188
I won't stand in the way of this marriage

15
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,023
into a family of prosecutors.

16
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,984
Just answer one thing.

17
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,864
Was my dad's death really an accident?

18
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,366
Eunnam, I didn't kill...

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,289
your father, Yeo Sunho.

20
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,877
That's what you're asking, right?

21
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,381
Whether I killed your father.

22
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,468
We were in an accident.

23
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,762
Sunho was unlucky and died.

24
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,930
And I was lucky and survived.

25
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,224
That's it.

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,228
I have a question too.

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,523
About Seo Dongju.

28
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,779
Can you end it for good?

29
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,115
If he clings after learning
you're Daesan's heiress,

30
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,201
it will be a problem.

31
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,914
How did you know about him?

32
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,874
Do my mom and grandfather know too?

33
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,250
Your mom knows.

34
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,087
I haven't told your grandfather.

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,549
An engaged granddaughter
living with another man?

36
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,637
It's not a topic for in-laws to discuss.

37
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,184
You know what Dongju's like.

38
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
He's not the clingy type.

39
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,949
How do you fall and end up
with a bruise like that on your cheek?

40
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,160
You look like you got punched.

41
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,787
Well...

42
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,331
I was washing my hands,
and the sink was wet.

43
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,459
I leaned in to check the mirror, and bam!

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,878
That's what happened, Aunt.

45
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,797
They say weddings never go smoothly.

46
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,299
Of course, you had to trip
and mess up your face.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,301
I'm so upset. Come over here.

48
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,388
- Gosh.
- Open your mouth.

49
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,147
How are you going to face
your in-laws like this?

50
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,608
And how will you face your mom
when you die?

51
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,027
Seriously, Aunt.

52
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,654
Why do you always take it that far?

53
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,948
Mom's probably looking down, grinning.

54
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,243
She probably loves her daughter-in-law.

55
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,581
Hey, do you love her that much?

56
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,084
That much?

57
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,887
<i>Dongju,</i>

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,599
<i>by the time you read this,</i>

59
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,852
<i>I'll be getting married.</i>

60
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:19,611
<i>Make sure you get your revenge
and walk in holding another woman's hand.</i>

61
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,907
<i>Jealousy will eat me alive,</i>

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,576
<i>but I deserve it.</i>

63
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,248
The chairman wants to see you.

64
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,720
Promise you won't make a scene.

65
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,014
Only then will you see him.

66
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,807
Move.

67
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,315
He was raised without a mother's care,

68
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,275
so he has his flaws.

69
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,152
Please be understanding.

70
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,616
- Professor Yeom.
- Yes, brother.

71
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,826
Excessive humility isn't proper etiquette.

72
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,245
As his uncle, I can confidently say

73
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,539
our Huicheol is a top-tier groom,

74
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,544
not just among prosecutors
but in the entire legal field.

75
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,505
Wouldn't you agree?

76
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,382
Yes.

77
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,551
All set
for the <i>pyebaek</i> ceremony?

78
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,220
The staff will let us know
when it's ready.

79
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,389
Good.

80
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,817
You...

81
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,862
You're an unbelievable bitch.

82
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,823
Do you know that?

83
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,160
You're right.

84
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,006
I don't need this fake watch anymore.
Take it.

85
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,386
It's actually real.

86
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,516
Seo Dongju.

87
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,103
- Leave Daesan.
- Hey, Yeo Eunnam.

88
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,314
Cut it out.

89
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,985
You woke up in my bed this morning
and married someone else by noon.

90
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,947
You fooled me into thinking
this watch was fake. Isn't that enough?

91
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,034
I'm never leaving Daesan.
Do you understand?

92
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,454
Huh Ildo knows all about us.

93
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,666
He even knows
that I hid who I am from you.

94
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,670
The guy who threw me out
of the wedding, Cheon Guho.

95
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,091
He works for Yeom Jangseon.

96
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,718
Looks like the chairman doesn't know.

97
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:58,264
If he knew, he wouldn't have made me
his assistant at your wedding.

98
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,818
Did you ever,

99
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,571
even for a second, consider marrying me?

100
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,955
I didn't.

101
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,671
And I was going to propose to you today.
What a fool I am.

102
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,423
I was going to ask,
but you went and married someone else.

103
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,094
This marriage comes
with a lot of Daesan shares.

104
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,721
This is the marriage I wanted.

105
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,394
Is it worth marrying someone
you don't even love?

106
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,775
Isn't it me who you love?

107
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,454
Love isn't required
for the marriage I want.

108
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,543
Put on the watch.

109
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,963
I'd rather people not see
the tattoo on your wrist.

110
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,333
Let's see.

111
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,425
Hey, it looks perfect as it is.

112
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,098
When did you get here?

113
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,849
A while ago.

114
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,519
Hmm.

115
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,313
You're not feverish,
but you look worn out.

116
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,774
What's going on, Stephanus?

117
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,861
As you can see, I'm fine.

118
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,367
It must be Pentecost,
judging by the flowers.

119
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,287
I didn't think you cared about church,

120
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,580
but you remember?

121
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,046
The woman you live with... Eunnam, right?

122
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,424
When will I meet her?

123
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,051
I got dumped.

124
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,429
See?

125
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,098
I told you not to get cocky
over your looks.

126
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,476
With a face like this, how can I not?

127
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,354
Jeez.

128
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,690
She must be out of her mind.

129
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,276
Dumping our handsome Dongju like that?

130
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,360
Sister Agnes!

131
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,947
Relax. Even God would understand.

132
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,409
- Want me to cuss her out?
- I'll handle the cursing.

133
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,536
You pray for her.

134
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,205
Because I can't pray for her.

135
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,375
So do it in my stead.

136
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,210
Pray that she stays

137
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,671
healthy and happy.

138
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,847
All right.

139
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,517
You curse all you want.

140
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
I'll just...

141
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,812
pray for Eunnam.

142
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,403
Seo Dongju!

143
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,322
Stephanus!

144
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,116
Here, take this.

145
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,286
{\an8}Put it in tea and drink it warm.
It's the good stuff.

146
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,914
If it's the good stuff,
you should have it.

147
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,543
Come on.
Half of your body belongs to whom?

148
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,048
To you.

149
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,718
I'm leaving.

150
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,722
- Don't skip your meals.
- Okay, I got it.

151
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,016
And make sure you have it.

152
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,865
CHAIRMAN
INCOMING CALL

153
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,912
The liquor safe is empty, Director Seo.

155
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,997
<i>Understood, sir.</i>

156
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:57,123
<i>Huh Ildo knows all about us.</i>

157
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,050
{\an8}8 YEARS AGO

158
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,565
Hello, sir.

159
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,777
I got called in while golfing.
I can't even think straight.

160
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,696
Where's my tie?

161
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,908
Great.

162
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,785
The chairman hates men
who do business without a tie on.

163
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,662
He says it lacks class.

164
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,831
I'm in trouble again.

165
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,672
Better me than you.

166
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:51,510
<i>So, you found errors
in Daesan Energy's financial report?</i>

167
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,263
How much did they try to fool me?

168
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,862
REVIEW REPORT
ON DAESAN ENERGY IMPORT DATA REPORT

169
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,833
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

170
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,878
Tell Ildo to come see me.

171
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,098
Wait.

172
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,519
Chief Choi hates raw eggs.
Why are there two glasses?

173
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,773
Ever had raw eggs before?

174
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,483
I've never tried it.

175
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,737
I'll give it a shot.

176
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,448
These are premium eggs.

177
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
Sorry?

178
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,529
{\an8}You watched me turn the dial, right?

179
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,573
Pardon?

180
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,407
I apologize, sir.

181
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,368
Open it and take out what's inside.

182
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,580
Sir, it's your safe. I can't...

183
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,748
If you can open this,

184
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,628
then you and I are the only ones
who know the liquor safe's code.

185
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,755
Isn't it fun?

186
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,434
I told you,

187
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,647
he has a photographic memory
and remembers everything he sees.

188
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,366
Here you go.

189
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,160
With a drink like this, who needs ginseng?

190
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,717
I'm here, Father.

191
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,014
You can go now.

192
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,183
Good work on the audit.

193
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:40,196
I went all out decorating
the bride's room on the second floor.

194
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,033
Why make me do it all over again?

195
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,203
Why spend their first night
in the guest room?

196
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,622
My goodness.

197
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,250
Wait.

198
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,210
I see.

199
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,172
I guess they want to be
far from the others.

200
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:01,677
Probably for a cozy, passionate night
without any interruptions.

201
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,599
Enough.

202
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,393
Got it, I'll stop.

203
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,732
Oh, my gosh!

204
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,820
You heard me rambling, didn't you?

205
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,240
Yes, "a cozy, passionate night"?

206
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,039
But you know what?

207
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,335
I feel like we're on the same boat.

208
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,253
My name is Jaok,

209
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,506
Hyeon Jaok.

210
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,091
First time hearing it?

211
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,512
"Ja" meaning "son,"
and "Ok" meaning "fruitful."

212
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,807
My father was disappointed
that I was born a girl,

213
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,101
so he put "son" in my name,
hoping he'd get one next.

214
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,186
Ms. Kaesong.

215
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,189
It's true that my grandfather
named me Eunnam,

216
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,107
hoping the second child would be a son.

217
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,988
See? That's why when I heard your name,
I knew we had something in common.

218
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,451
Where's your groom?
Why are you here alone?

219
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,619
Grandfather called for him.

220
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,703
He gathered everyone

221
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,998
for some cold <i>sujebi</i>
and a round of drinks.

222
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,918
Gosh. Oh no.

223
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,546
My poor husband must be so busy.

224
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,966
- You may go.
- Yes, ma'am.

225
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,394
My dress code for the night.

226
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,942
The chairman was pleased with you two
during the <i>pyebaek</i> ceremony.

227
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,114
He said you both looked great in <i>hanbok.</i>

228
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,034
Sorry for making you do the work twice.

229
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:54,747
Are you staying here because you don't
want to run into your parents upstairs?

230
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,875
Yes.

231
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,751
Especially...

232
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,671
my mom.

233
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,406
Hey, Huh Taeyun.

234
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,702
Why did you back away when you saw me?

235
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,455
You won't even talk to me?

236
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,003
You don't like me,
so I'm keeping my distance.

237
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,963
When did I say I didn't like you?

238
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,507
Before you went abroad...

239
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,967
Maybe a thousand times?

240
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,512
I left in middle school.
That was ages ago...

241
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,518
Wait... You actually counted?

242
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,401
Eunnam.

243
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,530
Are you happy

244
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,282
that you're married?

245
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,284
I just got married today.

246
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,703
It hasn't been a day yet.

247
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,166
Asking that to a sister who said
she hated you a thousand times?

248
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,627
I thought you'd marry Director Seo.

249
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,795
What?

250
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,465
Taeyun! What did you say?

251
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,800
That reaction means

252
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,927
you didn't tell Taeyun yourself, right?

253
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,304
Mom, you knew about this?

254
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,889
Both of you, shut your mouth.

255
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,557
It'll upset your grandfather.

256
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,685
He never expected much from me.
What's there to be upset about?

257
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,688
If that were true,
would he have arranged your marriage?

258
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,106
For once,

259
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,650
Grandfather was probably glad
I was born a girl

260
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,528
since he could
marry me off to the Yeom family.

261
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,614
Eunnam.

262
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,076
Don't look at me like that, Mom.

263
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,536
I agreed to this marriage.

264
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,501
How did you find out?

265
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,006
- Seriously...
- Eunnam.

266
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,009
If your grandfather finds out,

267
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,595
he'll feel intimidated by Yeom Jangseon.

268
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,264
He must never find out. And...

269
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,683
What else?

270
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,271
Be careful.
Don't let Prosecutor Yeom find out.

271
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,690
Be extra careful.

272
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,504
What's taking Eunnam so long?

273
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,339
And where's Director Seo?

274
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,008
You invited Director Seo too?

275
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,927
This is a family gathering.

276
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,347
An outsider would make
Prosecutor Yeom uncomfortable, Father.

277
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,308
Oh, as for me...

278
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,894
No, I'll be fine.

279
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,106
He's coming.

280
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,872
I thought it'd just be you and me.

281
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,748
I'll just go home.

282
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,667
Come sit, Director Seo.

283
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,337
The chairman invited you
because he considers you family.

284
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,464
Leaving now would be rude.

285
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,937
You should've seen
Huicheol grinning like a fool

286
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,650
even with his face all puffed up
from hitting the sink.

287
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,112
He was smiling like that
from the day we set him up.

288
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,241
Thank you both.

289
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,620
Huicheol wouldn't have turned out this way
without you two.

290
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,122
That's true.

291
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:11,833
Honey.

292
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:15,252
What did we even do?

293
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,758
Well, the one thing we did right
was finding a good match for Huicheol.

294
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:21,927
Boyeon.

295
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:27,473
The secretary who was
with Chairman Cha at the wedding

296
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,934
looked familiar.

297
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:35,399
That's Director Seo.
He comes by here often for work too.

298
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,404
You might've crossed paths
when you visited Seoul.

299
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,811
Dongju.

300
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,315
Dongju.

301
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,445
Seo Dongju.

302
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,381
Got a hangover? No surprise there.

303
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,802
God, you reek of alcohol.
Were you covered in alcohol or something?

304
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,681
Secretary Gong didn't ask me to wake you
out of formality.

305
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,017
She just didn't want to deal
with the smell herself.

306
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,854
Did I do anything stupid yesterday?

307
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,122
<i>Besides chugging
a fresh jar of liquor and passing out,</i>

308
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,916
not much.

309
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,586
Jeez.

310
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,506
The groom carried you here last night.

311
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:52,511
<i>He didn't seem so,
but he's quite manly and strong.</i>

312
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,472
<i>He carried you with ease.</i>

313
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,766
Jeez.

314
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,309
Yeom Huicheol...

315
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,894
Is Prosecutor Yeom still here?

316
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,605
He went back home
first thing in the morning.

317
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,357
Gosh.

318
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,442
Hurry and go see the chairman.

319
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,237
He's been waiting for hours.

320
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,405
Can you even drive?

321
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,700
You still reek of alcohol.

322
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,951
Where is the chairman?

323
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,331
Where else? He's at the office.

324
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,291
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

325
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,960
I should air out this room.

326
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,466
Shoot.

327
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,412
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

328
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,103
I'm sorry...

329
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,844
How does it feel

330
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:43,183
that you can't freely open
the liquor and money safes anymore?

331
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,227
When the liquor safe wouldn't open,

332
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,899
I figured you might've
changed the code by accident.

333
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,069
Then I saw the bottles were gone
from my briefcase.

334
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:59,491
That's when I realized
you'd found out about Eunnam and me

335
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,868
and changed the safe codes.

336
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,412
But even after realizing it,

337
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,207
I didn't want to accept it.

338
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,627
That's why I checked the inner safe.

339
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,839
Sir...

340
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,176
If you already knew,

341
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,388
why did you invite me to the wedding?

342
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:31,772
Since you prefer
getting straight to the point,

343
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,273
I'll cut to the chase

344
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,736
and tell you the reason
why I asked to meet you in private.

345
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,532
Your granddaughter,
who's about to become my nephew's wife,

346
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,993
has been living with Seo Dongju.

347
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:49,249
The wedding is tomorrow,
yet they're still together as we speak.

348
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,589
I apologize.

349
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,218
You could've called off the wedding
with a phone call. Why did you...

350
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,347
Kick Seo Dongju out of Daesan.

351
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,141
In exchange,

352
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,102
I'll overlook the mistake
of my nephew's fiancée,

353
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:14,274
and you can pretend you never

354
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,444
heard any of this.

355
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,905
I needed to confirm something.

356
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,282
Whether you...

357
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,745
really didn't know
Eunnam was my granddaughter.

358
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,874
To see if you wanted to marry into Daesan
with ulterior motives.

359
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,505
I had...

360
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,383
ulterior motives.

361
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,803
I knew about
your granddaughter, Jennifer Huh.

362
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,847
On a business trip to New York,

363
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,975
I planned to approach her,
hoping to eventually marry her.

364
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,103
I wanted to marry into Daesan
and rise through the ranks,

365
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,897
just like President Huh Ildo.

366
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,358
That was my initial plan.

367
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,446
But a day before my trip,

368
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,574
I met Eunnam.

369
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,744
You chose a woman over a fast promotion?

370
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,706
Back then, I was confident.

371
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,209
I was sure I could have both,

372
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,085
love and success.

373
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,592
After the wedding yesterday,

374
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,346
I told myself
to curse Eunnam until I forgot her,

375
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,766
throw myself into work, and move on.

376
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,435
That was the plan.

377
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,522
I guess that's out the window now.

378
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll make sure to hand over
my management files to Chief Choi.

379
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:46,699
Give me two days to wrap things up,
and I'll resign in three.

380
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,955
Thank you for everything, sir.

381
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,879
Spouting nonsense like that
just because you have a mouth.

382
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,258
Is it that difficult
to say that you're sorry?

383
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,062
What are you doing?

384
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,314
Your resignation isn't final yet.

385
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,535
I'm going to drive.

386
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,954
Sir, I'm sober now.

387
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,737
{\an8}BAKERY CAFE

388
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,906
You drove all this way for a bakery?

389
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,241
This is a good one.

390
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,122
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

391
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,848
Darn it, why leave the tongs here?

392
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,276
He's there!

393
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,736
- Hey! Seonu!
- Come on!

394
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,572
What are you doing?
Get out here!

395
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,996
I'll be back in an hour.

396
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,610
Can I get a cappuccino?

397
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,699
{\an8}JI YEONGSU, FORMER NEWS ANCHOR
AFTER DIVORCE, SHE DISAPPEARED...

398
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,496
That's Ji Yeongsu,
the news anchor.

399
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,664
I see...

400
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:44,127
I come here often,
but she acts like she doesn't know me.

401
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,630
Did you see the guy
who sped off on a bike?

402
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,383
- Yes.
- That's Ji Seonu.

403
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,927
Sir...

404
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,347
The reason you came
all the way to this bakery...

405
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,686
It is...

406
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,647
because of my son.

407
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,196
With a father who couldn't
even pass down his surname,

408
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,117
he's Ji Seonu, not Cha Seonu.

409
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,161
He's my son.

410
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,043
<i>Ji Yeongsu's son dropped out
of school and started baking with his mom.</i>

411
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,002
<i>Honey,</i>

412
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,088
<i>you're still keeping tabs on that kid?</i>

413
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:32,925
<i>You don't know my father well.</i>

414
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,679
<i>The moment Ji Seonu becomes Cha Seonu,</i>

415
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,807
Taeyun could end up being devoured.

416
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,563
You're worrying over nothing.

417
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,775
That will never happen.

418
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,069
Mom.

419
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,863
Hey, Taeyun!

420
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,908
You called me for this medicine?

421
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,994
Can't you drink it for me, Dad?

422
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,080
What?

423
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,790
Sure.

424
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,376
Worst case? Mom kicks us both out.

425
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,216
Hey, Taeyun.

426
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,886
I get the bitter stuff,
and you take the candy?

427
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,679
Hey...

428
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,562
Candy makes it less bitter.

429
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,192
Right, candy to chase down the medicine.

430
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,612
How did you learn about
your sister and Seo Dongju?

431
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,950
You'll upset his stomach
after his medicine.

432
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,119
When did you find out?

433
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,996
Dongju...

434
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,418
I mean, Director Seo...

435
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,589
It's over between them.

436
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,843
Why does it matter
when or how I found out?

437
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,058
Honey.

438
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,937
Did you hear that?
He just addressed him as Dongju.

439
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,931
I've practiced a lot, but I still mess up.

440
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,059
Well, even musicians make mistakes.

441
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,895
Proposed yet?

442
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,604
Not yet.

443
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,648
Practicing this for your proposal?

444
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:57,862
I want to play it when she walks
down the aisle at our wedding.

445
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,909
You'll need a lot of practice then.

446
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,705
Dongju, show me a picture of her.

447
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,916
A picture?

448
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,294
- You want to see?
- Yes.

449
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,464
Hey, try not to be too shocked.

450
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,383
She's really pretty.

451
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,764
Let's see. There.

452
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,899
That shocking?

453
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:36,776
Yes.

454
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,195
Her parents live in the States.

455
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,073
So right now, she's living with me.

456
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,503
Enjoying a good meal?

457
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,046
Grandfather.

458
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,713
Want some <i>ramyeon?</i>

459
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,881
It's okay.

460
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,051
We already had plenty of bread.

461
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,231
- Your grandfather came home, right?
- Yes.

462
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,149
Didn't he ask for <i>ramyeon?</i>

463
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,652
He said he had some bread.

464
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,405
- Bread?
- Yes.

465
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,074
With Director Seo.

466
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,910
He usually likes my <i>ramyeon.</i>

467
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,204
The bread filled him up.

468
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,559
It's just a liquor carrier.

469
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,228
I apologize for overdrinking

470
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:55,855
at dinner yesterday.

471
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,684
He explained everything to you,

472
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,730
yet you still invited Director Seo
to the wedding.

473
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,149
That really upset Mr. Yeom.

474
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,151
What a petty man.

475
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,614
A pathetic wretch,
not even worth chewed-up straw!

476
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,699
That Yeom bastard.

477
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,579
He talks big
about the National Patriotism Fund,

478
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,126
but at his core,
he's just a money-hungry leech!

479
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,212
Father!

480
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,256
No matter what, Seo Dongju has to go.

481
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,838
<i>The new codes
for the liquor and money safes.</i>

482
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,097
Someday, Ji Seonu must become Cha Seonu.

483
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,683
Do you understand?

484
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,554
You bastard...
What the hell are you doing here?

485
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,057
Move, asshole. It's narrow as it is.

486
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:38,601
Hey!

487
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,395
Quit swearing at me.

488
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,441
I said I'd stop hitting you,
not swearing at you.

489
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,152
You bastard...

490
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,153
How are you a prosecutor?

491
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,238
Prosecutor...

492
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,200
I swear, I'm about to...

493
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,535
Seriously!

494
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,955
Want me to even out the other side?

495
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,168
Okay.

496
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,504
I won't swear at you either.
So you stop too.

497
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,588
Got it?

498
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,383
The words from your mouth
are yours to control, so suit yourself.

499
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,303
My mouth, my rules. I'll say what I want.

500
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,139
Got it? Bye, then.

501
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,353
Damn that thug, seriously...

502
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,398
Sir, Director Seo is here to see you.

503
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,032
Sir, my apologies
for showing up unannounced.

504
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,158
Indeed.

505
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,828
No one shows up at my house
without notice.

506
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,746
Well...

507
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,083
The chairman figured if I called first,
you'd tell me not to come.

508
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,293
He told me to just go.

509
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,629
Chairman Cha Gangcheon...

510
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,048
Always thinking ahead,

511
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,467
isn't he?

512
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:19,285
Sending Director Seo here
with gold and dollars...

513
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,246
What kind of message is this?

514
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,998
The chairman didn't say much.

515
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,416
But I assume

516
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:30,920
it's his way of asking you
to take good care of his granddaughter.

517
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,506
From my perspective, it seems more like

518
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,677
he wants me to take back
my request to have you fired.

519
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,472
You didn't know?

520
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,642
No, sir.

521
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,646
Sir,

522
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,940
I'm not leaving Daesan.

523
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,194
It seems neither the chairman nor you

524
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,322
plan on that happening.

525
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,157
You don't need to worry about me.

526
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,326
I am worried.

527
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,247
Having you at Daesan feels like...
How can I explain this?

528
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,541
It feels like you are curled up

529
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,754
right at the foot of the bed
where my nephew and his wife sleep.

530
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,256
It's no different from that.

531
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,177
That thought won't leave my head.

532
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,350
That's not something
I can erase for you, sir.

533
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,893
This all happened

534
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,897
because you chose the woman I lived with
to be your niece-in-law, sir.

535
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,318
The only thing I can say

536
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:37,571
is that I respect Eunnam's decision

537
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,574
to marry Yeom Huicheol.

538
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:45,788
Uncle!

539
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,085
My friends keep nagging
about the secret wedding,

540
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,170
so I set up a meetup.

541
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,047
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.

542
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,133
She still feels a bit awkward.

543
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,819
- Are you coming with me?
- Yes.

544
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,696
I'll go with him.

545
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,700
And Aunt doesn't
feel like cooking tonight.

546
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,744
She told me

547
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,831
to tell you that she wants to eat out.

548
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,041
Barely married a few days

549
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,168
and she's already bossing you around.

550
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,838
Dinner out?

551
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,965
All right, go on then.

552
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,050
See you later.

553
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,554
Right, see you later.

554
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,596
There's something
Mr. Yeom forgot to pass on.

555
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,726
Manager Yoo
from Energy Resources Corporation

556
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:33,687
is meeting reporters after returning.

557
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,481
Oh, that.

558
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,690
<i>Since the hearing got canceled,</i>

559
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,318
reporters won't leave me alone.

560
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,737
It's driving me nuts.

561
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:46,325
I'll give you a news angle you can share.
Drop that one instead.

562
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,285
Preemptively?

563
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,412
An attack is the best defense, right?

564
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:55,167
Then, did you intentionally
make that story go public?

565
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,544
Yes.

566
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,354
Since President Huh
takes such good care of himself,

567
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,107
we tailored the waistline
to be more streamlined.

568
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,486
This is a gift from our daughter
for his vice-chairman promotion,

569
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,904
so make sure it's perfect.

570
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,030
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,200
Mom, why would I do that for him?

572
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,957
Get him a nice suit
for the appointment inauguration.

573
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,043
I'll get your husband a suit
for his birthday.

574
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,212
Let's see a suit for my son-in-law.

575
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,631
Of course.

576
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,056
Congratulations on your promotion!

577
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:56,353
You're getting ahead of yourself.
The announcement hasn't been made.

578
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,022
It seems like he wants to settle it today.

579
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:03,193
Otherwise, why would he
rush you here by helicopter?

580
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,706
I know you had high hopes
for the promotion, President Huh.

581
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,500
But that is the general opinion.

582
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,461
The subsidiary executives
and the board members at headquarters...

583
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,257
They think promoting you
to vice-chairman is premature.

584
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:28,719
The chairman

585
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,930
wants to promote you
to the group's vice-chairman.

586
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,267
I was told to meet with executives
over the next 10 days.

587
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,393
Father.

588
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,562
Address me as Chairman.

589
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,897
This isn't a private setting.

590
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,277
I understand that Ildo needs to lie low
for now because of the hearing.

591
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,820
But, Chief Choi,

592
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,617
does jumping from chief secretary
to vice-chairman make sense to you?

593
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,786
Well, I'm not sure.

594
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,331
And the board hasn't even approved it yet.

595
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,999
The decision will be made

596
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,461
at the next company-wide
personnel announcement.

597
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,712
Starting next year,

598
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,966
you'll be carrying the burden
of being vice-chairman.

599
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,135
Since you know the company inside out,

600
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:16,058
you'll serve as vice-chairman for now
and hand it over to President Huh.

601
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:21,312
President Cha, forget Daesan Energy
and focus on acquiring Yuseong Chemical.

602
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:25,025
Father, I really wanted
to take over Daesan Energy...

603
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,486
I mean, I really wanted to lead it.

604
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,530
So I'm truly disappointed.

605
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,075
But no one is more crushed
than my brother-in-law,

606
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,576
who just slipped off the track.

607
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,328
You're too harsh on him, Father.

608
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,456
It's just a business decision.

609
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,336
But let's hear from the man himself
before we wrap things up.

610
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,964
I went to prison.

611
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,884
I sat through the hearing.

612
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,429
I'm the one who gave everything to Daesan.

613
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,019
I should be vice-chairman.

614
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,064
Ildo.

615
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,775
Father wants to hear your opinion.

616
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,158
I will follow your decision, sir.

617
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,558
Director Seo.

618
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,102
- Come in.
- Yes, sir.

619
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:25,811
Yes.

620
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,857
How did it turn out
after rushing to Seoul by helicopter?

621
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,401
I got so excited that I couldn't wait.

622
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,446
I had to call you first.

623
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,364
I got nothing, sir.

624
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,200
<i>Seems the internal poll
conducted by Director Seo</i>

625
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,453
didn't work in my favor.

626
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,792
Again.

627
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,837
Again.

628
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:52,881
Again.

629
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,635
It's Seo Dongju again, isn't it?

630
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,051
Are you sure Manager Yoo moved here?

631
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,595
Yes, I'm sure of it.

632
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:45,267
I went to see him when I heard he was
leaving Energy Resources Corporation.

633
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,395
He wouldn't open the door,
so I couldn't see him.

634
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:04,870
Mr. Yoo?

635
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,629
Mr. Yoo?

636
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,551
I'm coming in.

637
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,138
Mr. Yoo?

638
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,482
NO CALLER ID

639
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:40,877
<i>Where's Seo Dongju?</i>

640
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,212
Buried Hearts

641
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,089
{\an8}<i>The fund exceeded two trillion.</i>

642
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:30,175
{\an8}<i>It resembles the hacking program
I encountered at the institute.</i>

643
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,136
{\an8}<i>I hid some of the slush fund.</i>

644
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,596
{\an8}Let me live,
and I'll return it and disappear.

645
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,225
{\an8}<i>Seo Dongju pocketed all my money</i>

646
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,978
{\an8}and took off.

647
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:44,149
{\an8}<i>Sending off Seo Dongju is so...</i>

648
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,151
{\an8}<i>Is Daesan
more important than a life?</i>

649
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:50,362
{\an8}<i>Right now, I only want two things.</i>

650
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:55,076
{\an8}<i>Money and you, Eunnam.
All that's left is for you to come.</i>

651
