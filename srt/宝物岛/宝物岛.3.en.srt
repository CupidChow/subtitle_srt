{\an8}EPISODE 3

9
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,294
What does this mean?

10
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,296
I don't want to die, sir.

11
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,847
Please spare me.

12
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,691
Get up.

13
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,158
I want you dead, but you want to live.

14
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,828
We've both laid our cards on the table.

15
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:28,417
If I was going to spare you if you begged,
I wouldn't have started this at all.

16
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,213
I skimmed off some of the slush fund.

17
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,589
What did you say?

18
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,757
Let me live,

19
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
and I'll return it and disappear.

20
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,060
Manager Yoo set up...

21
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,105
The National Patriotism Fund?

22
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,024
Yes, Manager Yoo
wanted to quit out of guilt

23
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,528
for helping me pocket money,
not just for the fund.

24
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,321
How much did you skim off?

25
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,574
Not much.

26
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,744
A little over 39 billion won.

27
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,250
You think 39 billion won is not much?

28
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,585
That's 39 stacks of 1 billion won

29
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,920
and 390 stacks of 100 million won.

30
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,342
You filthy thief, you've got some nerve,
and it will just kill you.

31
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,309
Director Seo,

32
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
are you serious?

33
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,273
You little...

34
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,359
If I hadn't tried to get rid of you,

35
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,029
you would've taken that big sum
without a trace.

36
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,823
The money would've been gone too
if I had died.

37
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,327
Shut up.
I'm going to bury you alive today!

38
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,537
Are you giving up

39
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,332
on the 39 billion won?

40
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,013
Director Seo,
transfer it to the Swiss account.

41
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,640
Right here, right now.

42
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,391
Try anything funny,

43
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,687
and you won't leave this room alive.

44
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,858
Sir, I don't gamble with my life.

45
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,286
Two billion now.

46
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,623
Seven billion
once I walk out of here safely.

47
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,749
The rest...

48
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,085
only after my safety is guaranteed.

49
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,586
You really don't trust me?

50
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,672
I don't, sir.

51
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,552
Before you even knew about the money,
you tried to kill me to protect the fund.

52
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,512
But you're still alive, aren't you?

53
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,098
I survived, sir.

54
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,445
Cheon Guho,

55
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,739
bring me a bowl of ice water.

56
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,869
And a bottle of wine for Mr. Yeom.

00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,379
{\an8}TRANSFER COMPLETED

58
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,691
Sir.

59
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,111
It's transferred.

60
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,574
If you put someone on my tail,
the rest of the money is off the table.

61
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,259
Deal with Manager Yoo's body.

62
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,136
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,104
The soup should stay warm
until Huicheol leaves for work.

64
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,523
Just pour it straight in,
no need to reheat.

65
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,360
- Got it.
- Here.

66
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,820
Get back safe.

67
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,829
I thought I'd die without seeing you.

68
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,580
What do you mean?

69
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,295
What happened?

70
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,861
Hey, did you fall?

71
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,405
Let me see. Are you hurt?

72
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,786
Why did Aunt have to pack you this
so late at night?

73
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,538
I asked her to.

74
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,374
You've been skipping breakfast
before work lately.

75
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,001
Right.

76
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,965
Did you catch a cold?

{\an8}LAST NIGHT, YOO TOOK HIS OWN LIFE
AND WAS FOUND DEAD...

79
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,161
It's me, Dongju.

80
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,287
<i>Look who it is.</i>

81
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,748
<i>I rushed to answer
thinking it was a new client.</i>

82
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,750
Let me borrow some money.

83
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,044
You can just come over.

84
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,255
What's with the weird number?

85
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,925
Are you worried that I'm broke?

86
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,095
A lot?

87
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,472
How much are we talking?

88
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,061
What?

89
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,282
Okay.

90
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,993
Just come.

91
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,759
{\an8}SEE YOU TOMORROW

92
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,167
Director Seo's car hasn't moved.

93
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,384
He must actually have the money on him.

94
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,032
Let's do it.

95
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,037
I might not be able to pay you back.

96
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,000
You said you'd put up
your land in Sejong as collateral.

97
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,627
Its value's bound to rise.

98
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,087
But...

99
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:21,592
will the hack you installed
on Yeom's computer really work?

100
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,593
You're the one who made it.

101
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,806
That's why I'm worried.

102
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,599
Big money's on the line.

103
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,146
The National Patriotism Fund
is worth over two trillion.

104
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,817
Jeez, Yeom Jangseon.

105
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,945
He must be a true patriot.

106
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,949
By the way,

107
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,494
how did you even think
to download the hack from my webpage?

It turned out that way
in my fight to survive.

111
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,781
Let's begin.

112
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,534
Give me a phone.

113
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,494
A phone?

114
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,713
This is disposable.

115
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,882
If you need more, let me know.

116
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,634
- I need one more.
- One more?

117
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,678
Okay.

118
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,865
I'll answer it.

119
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,950
NO CALLER ID

120
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,038
Yeom Jangseon speaking.

121
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,291
Sir, I've completed the transfer.
Please confirm.

122
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,500
I'll wait.

123
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,586
You wired it?

124
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,473
Yes, I'm checking the deposit.

125
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,881
<i>It's transferred.</i>

126
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,801
<i>The transfer
went through smoothly.</i>

127
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,971
Yes, understood, sir.

128
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,847
Wishing you longevity.

129
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,685
I'll contact you
after sending the remaining 30 billion.

130
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,400
He's wishing me longevity.
That bastard Seo Dongju.

131
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,923
Gosh.

132
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,008
You're here.

133
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,218
Hey, Seonu.

134
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,972
Typical of my mom.

135
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,587
Sir, are you a detective?

136
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,383
I've stayed
out of trouble these days.

137
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,176
I can tell.

138
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,553
You're not a cop, right?

139
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,387
Who are you?

140
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,473
Jeez.

141
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,524
Gosh.

142
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,490
What?

143
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,291
Who on earth are you?

144
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,002
Isn't it heavy? Go on.

145
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,593
Okay.

146
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,887
You're going to hurt your back.

147
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,763
- Pass me one.
- Move aside.

148
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,848
No, give me...

149
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,189
Mom, do you know him?

150
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,783
Mom, we're running out of eggs.

151
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,744
They came in. Look down there.

152
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,789
Here.

153
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,381
Thank you.

154
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,512
What? Right.

155
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,681
Got it.

156
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,606
You were here recently.

157
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,526
So, you remember.

158
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,611
Because you were with him.

159
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,573
Did you say anything to Seonu earlier?

160
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,325
I didn't say a word.

161
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,621
The chairman thinks

162
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,624
Ji Seonu should take his family name, Cha.

163
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,834
I don't want that.

164
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,960
Does Seonu feel the same?

165
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,505
- Of course...
- I need to hear it from him.

166
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,507
The answer to that question.

167
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,225
<i>Not right now, of course,</i>

168
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,270
<i>but I'll make the opportunity happen.</i>

169
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,690
<i>I came to tell you that.</i>

170
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,944
<i>If you ever need help,
feel free to contact me.</i>

171
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,282
<i>That's why the chairman brought me here.</i>

172
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,369
<i>To show me to you, Ms. Ji.</i>

173
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>So, what did you
and Seonu talk about?</i>

174
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,284
Did you tell him I'm his father?

175
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,791
It would've been too sudden anyway.

176
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,917
Good call.

177
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,752
I think it's too soon for that.

178
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,755
What did you two talk about all day?

179
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,844
We ate together, played some games,

180
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,554
and I told him about my childhood.

181
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,432
That's the way. Get close to him first.

182
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,477
That way, he'll listen to you later.

183
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,279
Sir, everything is ready.

184
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,238
Got a seat for Director Seo?

185
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,866
Of course.

186
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,288
All right, let's go.

187
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,708
Ah.

188
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,461
Since my son-in-law
missed the vice-chairman promotion,

189
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,465
I thought a nice meal
might help smooth things over.

190
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,306
Did you catch the news about Manager Yoo?

191
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,809
- Yes.
- Do you know anything I don't?

192
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:17,980
No, sir.

193
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,565
I see.

194
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,527
Hmm.

195
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,154
Sir.

196
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,907
I have a favor to ask.

197
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,411
I knew you had more on your mind
than just talking about Seonu

198
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,873
when you came all the way to my house.

199
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,625
What is it?

200
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,669
I need some time off.

201
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,006
You do need a break.

202
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,925
Wait.

203
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,426
The last time you took a break...

204
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,262
Not since my first year.

205
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,074
Where's Dr. Kim?

206
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,451
He's still in surgery.
It must be a tough one.

207
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,538
He didn't want to miss your soup,
so he said he'd hurry.

208
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,707
Pack some for him.

209
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,627
Secretary Gong!
When will the food be ready?

210
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,796
It's ready now, sir.

211
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,881
Okay.

212
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:30,885
Chef Do went all the way up to Cheorwon

213
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,429
to catch these native chickens himself.

214
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,183
Since they were free-range,
the meat's a bit firmer,

215
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,395
but the more you chew,
the richer the flavor gets.

216
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,356
You know Chef Do likes to exaggerate.

217
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,737
But even if it's not the most tender,
it's good for you. Let's go eat.

218
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Grandfather.

219
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,047
I'm home.

220
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,676
Eunnam.

221
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,763
Yeom Huicheol, that bastard.

222
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:20,018
Father, Eunnam shouldn't have to live
getting beaten like this.

223
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,561
I'll handle Prosecutor Yeom.

224
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,814
She's the eldest granddaughter
of Daesan Group!

225
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,524
Lower your voice, Gukhui.

226
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,402
Oh, dear.
For bruising, nothing beats this beef.

227
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,071
Red meat works best. Here, take this.

228
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,282
Chef Do, take it away.

229
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,908
The bruise will spread downward.

230
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,537
Apply early, even on clear skin,
for best effect.

231
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,455
My goodness.

232
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,833
He messed up your beautiful face.

233
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,543
Try this first. He says it'll help.

234
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,628
No, Aunt.

235
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,796
When I see Prosecutor Yeom,

236
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,799
I swear I'll break his legs.

237
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,650
Prosecutor Yeom,
did you get into an accident?

238
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,905
My goodness... Eunnam.

239
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,202
Yeo Eunnam!

240
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,913
Sorry for laughing,
Prosecutor Yeom.

241
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,414
My goodness.

242
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,835
Seriously, she's really something else.

243
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,004
Right, that's the way.

244
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,589
If you're not planning to divorce,

245
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,593
whether you fight it out or hug it out,
you should settle it right away.

246
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,179
I apologize.

247
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,138
I'll take Eunnam back.

248
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,349
Eunnam, get up.

249
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,018
I'm not going back to that house.

250
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,813
Eunnam.

251
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,567
Isn't it a bit too rash
to break up after one fight?

252
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,822
This is embarrassing. Let's go.

253
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,956
- I said let's go.
- I'm not going!

254
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,447
Director Seo, you're done here.

255
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,493
And, Eunnam, come with me.

256
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,635
Shouldn't you two go in there?

257
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,720
Father will handle it.

258
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,014
Ildo, this is your moment.

259
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,351
Step up and be the father you should be.

260
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,685
It's the perfect time to do so.

261
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,564
"Eunnam, you're married now.
Go back home immediately."

262
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,733
Discipline firmly.

263
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,110
That's how you show love.

264
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,495
What's this?

265
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,663
<i>Samgyetang?</i>

266
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,458
Dr. Kim is probably waiting for it.

267
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,670
Is this your way of telling me...

268
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,255
to shut up and leave?

269
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,267
Taeyun, drive Huicheol home.

270
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,185
Yes, Grandfather.

271
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,439
Tell your family clearly
so there'll be no misunderstanding.

272
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,860
That Eunnam will stay here for now
and return when the time is right.

273
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,237
- Father.
- Father.

274
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,115
That is not right. They're newlyweds.

275
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,742
Fighting is how they build a bond.

276
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,329
They should stay together
to reconcile on their own and...

277
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,207
And if they fight again?

278
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,209
Will you take responsibility?

279
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
What?

280
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,753
Well...

281
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,048
Trust me and wait.

282
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,717
Do you understand?

283
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,470
Yes, understood.

284
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,600
Dongju.

285
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,233
How did you get here?

286
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,453
Eunnam.

287
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,751
I'll call you.

288
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,594
Eunnam.

289
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,482
How about some tea?

290
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,152
Mom, I'll take a drink instead.

291
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,085
Huicheol said

292
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,172
that on our wedding night,

293
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,674
when we were
having <i>sujebi</i> with Grandfather,

294
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,845
he could tell something was off
between me and Dongju.

295
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,808
He asked me outright,
and I didn't want to lie.

296
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,195
Huicheol made
some insulting remarks about Dongju,

297
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,447
and I couldn't let it slide, so we fought.

298
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,825
Prosecutor Yeom
is the one who was insulted.

299
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,037
You took another man's side over him.

300
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,041
Put yourself in his shoes.

301
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,503
Eunnam.

302
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,549
Do you remember?

303
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,136
As a kid, you'd cry
and kick me out of this study,

304
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,348
saying it was your dad's room.

305
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:41,937
No, I don't.

306
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,774
<i>"Miss, please open the door."</i>

307
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,654
"No matter how much it called,
no one responded."

308
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,197
"The oriole watching nearby

309
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,993
sang in its sweet, clear voice."

310
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,623
"Tweet, tweet, tweet!"

311
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,794
"Tweet, tweet, tweet!"

312
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,588
"Then, a startled sound
came from the room,

313
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,467
and the door creaked open."

314
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,176
- Dad.
- Yes.

315
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,262
Read this part again.

316
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,514
- Again?
- Yes.

317
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,599
Okay, it's your favorite part.

318
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,978
I'll read it again.

319
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,565
"Tweet, tweet, tweet!"

320
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,944
"Tweet, tweet, tweet!"

321
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,616
"Tweet, tweet, tweet!"

322
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,123
Whenever I come in here,

323
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,834
I think about Dad reading to me.

324
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,796
Glad it brings back good memories.

325
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,256
But, Eunnam,

326
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,218
I'm sure your father
wouldn't want to see you divorce.

327
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:01,307
If he were alive,
wouldn't he just want me to be happy?

328
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:04,143
You chose this marriage.
That's what you said.

329
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:08,230
To clarify, I chose the Daesan Group
shares Grandfather promised to give me

330
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,899
if I got married.

331
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,278
"If I want to beat President Huh,

332
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,571
I need those shares."

333
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,990
That was my intention.

334
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,334
You're both drunk.

335
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,392
Did you know, Mom?

336
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,063
I thought I could let go of Dongju

337
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,566
without regret, but...

338
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,905
But I'm a mess like this.

339
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,700
What should I do?

340
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,673
{\an8}BEE POLLEN
1 TEASPOON A DAY

341
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,503
Yes, I'm ready.

342
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,799
In 10 days, I'll wire the money
to Yeom Jangseon's Swiss account.

343
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,761
Once he confirms, I'll settle up with you.

344
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,889
Count my hacking fee

345
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,933
and labor costs separately.

346
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,104
Enjoy your break

347
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,774
and come back like a champ.

348
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,109
Wait.

349
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,406
Make sure I have a front-row seat
when Yeom Jangseon completely loses it.

350
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,742
Bye.

351
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,590
OVERSEAS REMITTANCE APPLIED

352
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,186
Yes, sir. It's been transferred.

353
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,314
Please confirm it. I'll wait.

354
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,748
It's in.

355
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,585
Finally, it's all wrapped up.

356
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,798
Director Seo,
you wished me longevity last time, right?

357
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,720
You've got a long road ahead of you.
Thousands of miles of opportunity.

358
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,557
I'll wish you
a long, prosperous, and safe life.

359
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,141
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

360
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,685
Thanks for sparing my life
instead of killing me.

361
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,189
Why spoil a good day with such grim talk?

362
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,441
Let's just forget the past.

363
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,526
Yes.

364
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,653
I'll see you next time.

365
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,940
Calling to pay up?

366
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,858
<i>I've settled the interest, principal,</i>

367
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,612
hacking fee, and your labor costs.

368
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,823
Plus, a bonus.

369
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,826
Nice.

370
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,162
Now you're the only one
who knows the password

371
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,748
to the two-trillion-won account.

372
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,961
I guess that means Yeom can't
ever try to kill you now, right?

373
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,903
<i>It's me, Dongju.</i>

374
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,050
<i>Right now, I only want two things.</i>

375
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,931
<i>Money and you, Eunnam.</i>

376
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,635
<i>All that's left is for you to come.</i>

377
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,134
Pass.

378
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,387
Nice.

379
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,198
Nice.

380
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,957
Wow, it went over.

381
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,787
Great job.

382
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,539
There you go.

383
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,252
One more time.

384
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,172
- One more time?
- Yes.

385
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,300
Fine, one last time.

386
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,552
Here we go.

387
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,471
One more time?

388
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,849
One, two, three.

389
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,476
<i>Eunnam.</i>

390
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,356
<i>If you don't come,
I'm staying single forever.</i>

391
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,611
<i>You're clinging now
instead of getting revenge.</i>

392
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,655
<i>It's pathetic.</i>

393
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,782
<i>I know it is.</i>

394
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,034
<i>This life's a lost cause.</i>

395
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,663
I was told
you're the only woman for me in this life.

396
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,456
By whom?

397
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,125
By myself.

398
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,704
- Yeah.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

399
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,581
Home.

400
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,124
Still?

401
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,293
I'm...

402
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,169
not coming.

403
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,338
Eunnam...

404
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,285
What are you doing?

405
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,037
Hey, you jerk!

406
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:17,877
Dongju!

407
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,212
Dongju!

408
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,138
Dongju!

409
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,599
Dongju!

410
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,370
Sir.

411
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,539
You've come a long way. Get some rest.

412
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,675
I'll give it a go.

413
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,432
It's a mess from the start.

414
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,100
I'll start.

415
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,387
That's it.

416
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,098
I didn't practice the rest.

417
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,600
I wanted to master it

418
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,313
and play it for you whenever you wanted...

419
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,734
I'm hungry.

420
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,081
Let's see.

421
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,712
There.

422
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:03,059
This is the chairman's recipe
that's more precious than wild ginseng.

423
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,728
Soju with raw eggs.

424
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,108
Almost forgot.

425
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,491
Ta-da.

426
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,202
- I said let's go.
- I'm not going!

427
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,954
I got it fixed.

428
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:26,208
The shop said the gems were still intact.

429
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,853
When I left the NIS, I took it with me

430
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,271
in case I needed it

431
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,192
to do something patriotic one day.

432
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,445
This gun hasn't fired in a while.

433
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,782
You have to pour out filthy water gently,
or it'll splash back on you.

434
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:50,329
You did a great job
getting rid of that filth, Seo Dongju.

435
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,880
You've always had a knack
for shooting, haven't you?

436
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:05,719
But I heard from Guho
that you spent several days at the range.

437
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,641
I get it.

438
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:15,186
Sending Seo Dongju off must have been...

439
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,022
Killing Seo Dongju...

440
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,234
wasn't easy.

441
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,783
Personal feelings
have no place in serving the fund.

442
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,246
Seems like you got attached.

443
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,751
That's not what I meant.

444
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,508
Of course not. That's not it at all.

445
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,760
Listen,

446
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,722
from the moment
you introduced that kid to me,

447
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:56,812
I knew you two were headed
for a short, intense ending.

448
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,732
I wanted to hold a funeral for him,

449
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,026
but it seems the fish got a feast.

450
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,862
Seo Dongju's body hasn't surfaced.

451
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,617
Guho!

452
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,007
A quiet cleanup calls for a proper reward.

453
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,342
I picked out something good.

454
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,844
I'll transfer the amount you told me

455
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,431
from the Swiss account
to Mr. Huh's Bahama account right away.

456
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:37,935
It wouldn't be right to thank you
with just a bottle of wine

457
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,646
when you took care of the filth.

458
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:44,567
Well, we got back the money
Seo Dongju stole, so...

459
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,611
It's not a bribe, just a sincere token.

460
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:49,281
And it's a generous sum.

461
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,160
I'll send it to your account.

462
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,413
Use it as pocket money or invest it.

463
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,790
Whatever you like.

464
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,805
I know guys like Seo Dongju very well.

465
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,475
A type that never bows to anyone.

466
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,810
His loyalty?

467
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,021
Not fake but never real either.

468
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,898
Here.

469
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,492
Sir.

470
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,161
Give me a moment.

471
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,245
Why did you do it?

472
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,038
For Daesan.

473
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,500
Is Daesan more important
than a person's life?

474
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,177
It's far more important than you.

475
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,152
Far more...

476
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:40,827
important.

477
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,753
<i>Are you saying I just tossed</i>

478
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,006
<i>Seo Dongju's two-trillion-won head
to the fish?</i>

479
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,259
Hey, Guho.

480
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,888
How do you know this was Dongju's doing?

481
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:08,772
It resembles the hacking program
I encountered at the institute.

482
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,193
Dongju must have planted it
during the transfer.

483
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm sorry.

484
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,707
Hey, Ildo.

485
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:33,338
Seo Dongju stole
the National Patriotism Fund...

486
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,340
I mean, my money.

487
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:40,887
He stole all my money,
locked it in his head, and ran off.

488
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,642
And you shot and killed the man
who's worth two trillion won.

489
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,480
Director Seo hacked the Swiss account
and changed the password.

490
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:52,106
It's an anonymous account,

491
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:56,152
so we can't claim ownership
without the 31-character password.

492
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,072
Sir...

493
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:05,412
That bastard Dongju dragged all of us down
with him and fed us to the fish.

494
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:11,209
He kept the damn password in his head,
and now he's gone!

495
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,504
There's no way to bring him back.

496
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,685
The answer was right in front of us.

497
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,563
You need to take responsibility.

498
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:33,648
Sir.

499
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,694
Seo Dongju, the one who caused this mess,
was a Daesan man.

500
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,279
He's your guy, Ildo.

501
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,240
So, you take responsibility.

502
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,868
How am I supposed to?

503
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,578
It's a big sum.

504
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:55,336
It's a lot of money to give up
over a simple request,

505
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:56,713
isn't it?

506
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,759
Let me give you some real motivation.

507
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,552
Guho!

508
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,973
These are just the thumbnails.

509
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,642
In this video,

510
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:14,522
you'll see every moment
from when you rented the boat.

511
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,776
Every move captured by the drone.

512
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:22,404
Anyone could tell that Huh Ildo,
CEO of Daesan Group, is a murderer.

513
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,532
No room for doubt, right?

514
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,206
Until you figure out
how to fill that hole in my account,

515
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,088
you're not taking a single step
out of this room,

516
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:39,965
President Huh Ildo.

517
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,557
Hey, Huh Ildo, you bastard.

518
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,980
Staring at me won't solve anything.

519
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,481
Either cough up my two trillion won

520
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:01,152
or raise Seo Dongju from the dead
if you have to!

521
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,253
Shoot.

522
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,042
Rest in peace...

523
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,802
Tigers leave their stripes,

524
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:52,931
and you left behind a luxury watch.

525
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,476
Hope you're in a better place.

526
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,325
I thought you were dead!

527
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,660
Take this watch back.

528
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:15,829
Just take it back!

529
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,167
I gave you the watch. Go away!

530
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,878
Please go away! Jeez!

531
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,177
Are you okay?

532
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:32,929
Hey.

533
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,453
Yes, sir.

534
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,875
He's still just sitting there.

535
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:03,960
Yes, I understand.

536
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,053
Where's Mr. Yeom?

537
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,643
What do you mean you can't make up for it?

538
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,229
Are you telling me to suck it up?

539
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,772
Is that it?

540
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:27,275
I'll find a way to secure

541
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,610
the emergency funds you need.

542
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:30,987
Looking for a way

543
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,199
isn't a real plan.

544
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:40,580
There's a secret slush fund vault
managed by Chairman Cha Gangcheon.

545
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,542
You're planning to steal it?

546
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,421
Just borrowing it

547
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,632
for a while.

548
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,557
If you don't come up
with something better,

549
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,935
Daesan Energy will have to run at a loss.

550
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,230
Then the company's main bank
will tell you to sell it.

551
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:09,442
If Daesan Energy gets passed around
and eventually sold off,

552
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,529
you'll be able to rake off
about a trillion won.

553
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,291
Yum.

554
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,963
Good job. It's delicious.

555
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,432
Why aren't you eating?

556
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,895
I don't like Taeyun's <i>ramyeon,</i>
Grandfather.

557
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,466
Yum!

558
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,809
Would you like some more?

559
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,368
Father, we should go.

560
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,872
Sure, let's go.

561
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,773
INNER SAFE

562
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,035
Taking a bath
right after eating <i>ramyeon</i>

563
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:27,329
isn't good for your health, Chairman.

564
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,955
I won't take long.

565
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,167
Reading <i>Myeangsim Bogam</i>
will make me sleepy.

566
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,320
MYEANGSIM BOGAM

567
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,021
Seo Dongju.

568
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,987
You'd better come back to life.

569
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,617
You bastard.

570
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:57,832
Come back to life.

571
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,047
Come back to life.

572
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,512
Come back to life!

573
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,265
Right now!

574
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,660
Buried Hearts

575
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:20,790
{\an8}<i>Remember, South Korea's fate
hinges on what's in Seo Dongju's head.</i>

576
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,834
{\an8}<i>Mr. Yeom has his eyes
on Daesan Energy.</i>

577
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:28,421
{\an8}<i>I'll give you the money
once Dongju's back from vacation.</i>

578
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,133
{\an8}Looks like the chairman forgot who I am.

579
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,804
{\an8}<i>When will the package arrive?</i>

580
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,681
{\an8}<i>Bring back Seo Dongju quickly.</i>

581
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,140
{\an8}<i>They thought I was dead.</i>

582
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,728
{\an8}<i>Now that I'm back, they must be terrified.</i>

583
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,231
{\an8}Seo Dongju!
