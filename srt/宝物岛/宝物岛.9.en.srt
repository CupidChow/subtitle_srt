I should save the rest for a toast.

5
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,699
My nephew's wife couldn't forget
the man she lived with before marriage.

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,203
She dreamed
of getting back together with him.

7
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:25,043
Then when my niece-in-law, Yeo Eunnam,
heard he had died,

8
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,505
she followed him

9
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,299
to the grave.

10
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,013
Then what about Huicheol?

11
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,515
That damn woman.

12
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,604
Make sure Huicheol inherits
her shares, the land from her late father,

13
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,897
the money in her accounts.

14
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,691
Every last bit of it.

15
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,026
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,906
Ildo.

17
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,703
You need to give us the news
that Seo Dongju's been dealt with

18
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,998
so your dear stepdaughter can follow.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,376
Hurry up.

20
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,350
<i>If Chairman Huh is
taking too long…</i>

21
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,644

24
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,335
{\an8}I'm here.

25
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,645
You're not going to die, right?

26
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,565
I trusted you, gave up my violin
and came all this way.

27
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,527
The thought of you dying…

28
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,655
scares me.

30
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,970
I can't live without you.

31
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,389
Dongju.

32
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,890
I have…

33
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,560
something I'm curious about.

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
My dad…

35
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,153
Why did he put you
in this critical condition?

36
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,281
Why didn't he call 911 that day?

37
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,825
I just don't get it.

38
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,620
If the ambulance had arrived sooner,

39
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,373
you wouldn't be like this.

40
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,627
We have a medical emergency
at 19-1 Hannam-dong. Please come quickly.

41
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,088
When is the ambulance getting here?

42
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,548
I'll go check.

43
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,717
Call and hurry them up.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,801
Yes, Grandfather.

45
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,223
Is this emergency services?

46
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,893
Yes, I'm calling from 19-1 Hannam-dong.

47
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,520
We reported a medical emergency earlier.

48
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,023
Please send an ambulance immediately.

49
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,150
<i>We have no record
from this address.</i>

50
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,735
<i>This is the first report.</i>

51
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,738
<i>An ambulance is on its way now.</i>

52
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,910
Dongju.

53
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,163
If you don't wake up and die like this,

54
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,874
I'll lose my mind.

55
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,877
So wake up for me, please?

56
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,975
<i>Taeyun.</i>

57
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,730
<i>I am ready to die right now.</i>

58
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>But I won't leave my life to fate.</i>

59
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,484
<i>I'll take responsibility for everything.</i>

60
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,697
<i>But, Taeyun,</i>

61
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,909
<i>not just yet.</i>

62
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,789
<i>When Daesan Group belongs
to Chairman Huh Ildo and Huh Taeyun…</i>

63
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,542
<i>Until we get there…</i>

64
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,506
<i>Once we get there,</i>

65
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,967
<i>I'll take care of everything, Taeyun.</i>

66
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,514
Yeah.

67
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,309
Yeah, okay.

68
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,686
Yes, I heard.

69
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,606
So,

70
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,150
no sign of improvement with Director Seo?

71
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,652
His sleep disorder was severe,

72
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,155
but his night sleep duration
is increasing.

73
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,116
<i>The way he perceives day
and night differently</i>

74
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,160
<i>suggests his cognitive function
is recovering.</i>

75
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,163
I see.

76
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,583
<i>Then what if we take him</i>

77
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,502
abroad for treatment?

78
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,087
<i>Well…</i>

79
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:53,009
There's nowhere he can be treated better
than in Korea, Chairman.

80
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,969
You're right, Dr. Kang.

81
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,057
I know that, but I'm just that desperate.

82
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,645
There's something
Director Seo needs to take care of

83
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,357
while my mind is still intact.

84
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,318
Yes.

85
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,779
Yes, that's true.

86
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,865
Keep doing what you can, Dr. Kang.

87
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,118
Okay.

88
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,000
Secretary Gong,

89
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,669
charge my phone.

90
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,094
She's gone.

91
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,598
No one will come until morning.
You're safe.

92
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,998
<i>Boss! Stop it, you jerk!</i>

93
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,167
<i>Hey! Stop it!</i>

94
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,793
<i>Hey! Shoot!</i>

95
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>Boss, it's Yangchun.</i>

96
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>I'm so sorry, boss.</i>

97
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,596
<i>I'm sorry you have to see me like this.</i>

98
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,306
- Yangchun.
<i>- I'll be there soon.</i>

99
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,432
Hang on.

100
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,185
<i>- Boss, I'll be there.</i>
- I'll get you out of there.

101
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,400
Where did you hide Yangchun?

102
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,986
Is he safe?

103
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,072
If you're worried,
I'll let you switch places.

104
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,408
He'll take your spot,
and I'll put you in instead.

105
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,578
Gosh.

106
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,707
Or maybe I'll just lock you both up.

107
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,255
Do you not think at all that I'll just…

108
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,090
kill both of you?

109
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,639
Have you ever killed someone before?

110
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,988
Hold still.

111
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,745
Yeo Eunnam…

112
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,207
Yeo Eunnam dies today.

113
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,252
Why would Eunnam die?

114
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,425
Yeom Jangseon?

115
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,139
Stop.

116
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,683
If Eunnam runs,

117
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,561
the hitman will be on her tail
to finish the job.

118
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,272
Let us go, and I'll handle it…

119
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,529
DONGJU

120
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,455
<i>Eunnam.</i>

121
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,125
Eunnam. It's me, Dongju.

122
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,253
Yes, I know.

123
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,382
It's you, Dongju.

124
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,854
Can I help you, ma'am?

125
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,731
I'm leaving.

126
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,649
Mr. Yeom will be here soon.

127
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,632
Take it.

128
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,759
I said, take it.

129
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,137
<i>I'll give you just one chance.</i>

130
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,056
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

131
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,349
Who are you?

132
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,769
He's asking who I am.

133
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,524
Darn…

134
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
Gilbin!

135
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,819
Administrator?

136
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,445
<i>Leave the target untouched</i>

137
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,656
<i>and get out of there now.</i>

138
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,662
Hello?

139
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,205
Yes, Dongju.

140
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,378
Okay.

141
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,630
Yes, that place.

142
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,382
Okay.

143
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,929
You should go home now.

144
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,181
Caregiver Jang Ilnam will be in touch.

145
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,766
Okay.

146
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,851
Get home safe.

147
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,378
Your phone.

148
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,284
When I was being waterboarded,

149
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,912
you and Yeom Jangseon
were playing the same game.

150
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,749
When I collapsed from the cinnamon,

151
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,878
you faked a 911 call,
hoping I'd just drop dead, didn't you?

152
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,591
But why did you save me today?

153
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,802
I'm curious.

154
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,224
But you know what?

155
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,643
I saved you twice too.

156
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,104
When you fell into the ocean…

157
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,649
and right now.

158
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,071
I'm letting you live
instead of killing you.

159
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,944
Why does that old man keep staring at me?
It's creepy.

160
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,079
I knew it. Total creep.

161
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,543
Huh?

162
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,919
My goodness.

163
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,732
It's the same old man.

164
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,493
Sir, what are you doing here?

165
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,746
You don't remember me?

166
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,082
The bakery.

167
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,837
Wow, just ignoring me.

168
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,298
Let's go home now.

169
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,133
What?

170
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,177
Where do you live?

171
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,101
Come on, let's get you home.
I'll give you a ride.

172
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,894
Okay.

173
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,534
I was saving those shoes.
This old man is high maintenance.

174
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,744
Let's go now.

175
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,718
Next time we meet,
let's act like strangers, got it?

176
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,802
Turn right here!

177
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,308
You should've given me a heads up!

178
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,111
{\an8}He's over there.

179
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,372
We were searching
in the opposite direction.

180
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,124
All the roads connect.

181
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,876
What are we going to do?

182
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,502
He's barefoot.

183
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,587
Goodness!

184
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,173
Honey, did you find the chairman?

185
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,091
Where's Father?

186
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,887
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.
This won't do.

187
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,641
Gosh, Father…

188
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,727
Father!

189
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,855
Isn't it better to just call the police?

190
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,399
<i>That is absolutely not an option.</i>

191
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,194
If we report the chairman missing
and it makes the news,

192
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,654
Daesan's stock will crash.

193
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,241
That's why the higher-ups
don't want the police involved.

194
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,661
Stop running around blind.
Think before you act.

195
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,747
Jeez.

196
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,792
Go back to your room.

197
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,711
Go back? I need to help find the chairman.

198
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,964
I should help with these two eyes
and these two feet.

199
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:43,719
Old folks with dementia wander off
and never make it back all the time.

200
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,304
Ms. Kaesong!

201
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,432
Deokhui, fire her.

202
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,017
I can't stand her anymore.

203
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,520
The chairman can't eat without Chef Do.

204
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,439
If his dementia worsens,
food won't matter.

205
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,149
Deokhui!

206
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,821
Why did you hide
Father's condition from me?

207
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,198
I didn't know!
I just found out today!

208
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,324
Ouch!

209
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:07,368
Ma'am, let go of her.

210
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,037
What were you scheming
with our sick father?

211
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,914
Honey!

212
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,875
Deokhui, what's the matter?

213
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,962
Honey, I didn't know
about Father's dementia, right?

214
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,214
You never told me!

215
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,094
Calm down. As Father ordered me,
I didn't tell anyone.

216
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,220
Dosu.

217
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,515
Stay out of this.
This is our family's business.

218
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,599
Deokhui!

219
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,229
Spill everything about how you tried
to ruin Taeyun's future.

220
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,897
Right now!

221
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,026
Deokhui, why would I ruin Taeyun's future?

222
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,114
I even left my kids in the US
so they wouldn't get in his way!

223
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,198
Deokhui…

224
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,410
Cha Deokhui! That's enough!

225
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,373
Deokhui.

226
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,626
That's enough.

227
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,978
Everyone go back out
and find the chairman.

228
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,646
He's walking around

229
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,649
barefoot right now.

230
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,109
Okay.

231
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:23,903
What about Grandfather?

232
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,788
Disappear now.

233
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,500
Didn't you come to get rid of Seo Dongju?

234
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,179
At this rate,
Mr. Yeom will lose faith in you.

235
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,527
CHEON GUHO:
CALL ME

236
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,277
Nothing yet, sir.

237
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,240
Wait any longer,
and the wine I opened will be ruined.

238
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,617
I'll prepare a better bottle of wine.

239
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,703
I opened the best bottle we had.

240
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,207
Isn't it refreshing?

241
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,838
Finally peeling off
that leech, Seo Dongju.

242
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:51,550
I can't celebrate with cheap wine.
This calls for the finest drink.

243
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,304
Guho, when this is all over,
go to the main house

244
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,431
and get yourself a big bowl
of <i>janchi guksu.</i>

245
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,850
Come to think of it,

246
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,977
it all started with those noodles.

247
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,151
<i>My goodness.</i>

248
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,987
You really love <i>janchi guksu.</i>

249
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,660
Chief Cheon sure has a knack
for getting good food.

250
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,955
If I don't answer, just wait outside.

251
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,875
Yes, sir. I'll wait from now on.

252
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,169
What brings you to the main house?

253
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,215
The background check
on Daesan's new hire, Seo Dongju, is done.

254
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:38,430
As you expected,
before college, he lived rough.

255
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,890
A thug, right?

256
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,517
- Yes.
- I knew it.

257
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,687
A punk like that
has no place in Daesan Group.

258
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,439
Gosh.

259
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,024
I'll tell them to fire him.

260
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,652
There's a photo
you haven't seen yet.

261
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,905
Here, honey.

262
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,576
The children are
Seo Dongju and Seo Yeonju.

263
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,746
The mother holding the child is Ko Youjin.

264
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,291
She worked at Iris nightclub
and died when Dongju was in first grade.

265
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,962
The man next to them
is Seo Byeongdeuk, an Iris waiter.

266
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,506
He gave the siblings his surname.

267
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,924
He's now in the US.

268
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,759
Gave them his surname?

269
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,429
People do that when they adopt.

270
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,514
That's not it.

271
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,267
I spoke with Seo Byeongdeuk
who now lives in Las Vegas.

272
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,978
Madame Pi at Iris begged this man,

273
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,106
and when Dongju was little,
he sold his surname for money.

274
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,024
My goodness.

275
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,528
Dongju probably wasn't
even registered at birth until then.

276
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,612
Right?

277
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,538
Honey,

278
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,624
this child with the tied-up hair.

279
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,251
It's Seonghyeon.

280
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,169
Chu Seonghyeon.

281
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,379
Chu Seonghyeon?

282
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,801
Looks similar, but it's a different kid.

283
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,012
Hold on.

284
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,688
Honey.

285
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,317
Look at this.

286
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,531
Look at him showing off the badge.

287
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,741
It's the same kid.

288
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,701
Even when we changed
his clothes at our house,

289
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,371
he always asked
to keep that badge on.

290
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,251
What kind of badge was it?

291
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,630
I looked into it.
It's an old Daesan Group badge.

292
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,550
So, did Seo Dongju, the new hire,

293
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,386
admire Daesan Group since childhood?

294
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,390
Honey, let me meet Seo Dongju…

295
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,852
I mean, let me meet Seonghyeon once.

296
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,271
And what about his mother…

297
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,114
Look closely.

298
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,701
It's a different kid.

299
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,129
You're right.

300
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,674
They do look similar,

301
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,885
but they're different kids.

302
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
They're different.

303
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,724
It's not the same child.

304
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,172
Dongju.

305
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,395
Are you okay?

306
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,816
Let's get out of here.

307
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,782
My car's over there.

308
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,581
Can you wait inside for a bit?

309
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,167
Why?

310
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,735
Not the hospital.

311
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,196
Take me to the chairman's residence.

312
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,658
I need to speak with him.

313
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,980
HUH ILDO

314
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,571
Okay.

315
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,825
Yes, Cheon Guho speaking.

316
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,034
Hey, Ildo.

317
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,996
I mean, Chairman Huh,
you've been through a lot.

318
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,499
Now, let's give
the late Seo Dongju a proper send-off

319
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,085
so his spirit won't hold a grudge.

320
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,171
Hey, Yeom Jangseon. It's me, Seo Dongju.

321
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,967
<i>You remember Madame Pi?</i>

322
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,886
<i>She once said</i>

323
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,721
people should die

324
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,098
in the order they came into this world.

325
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,933
That's how it's supposed to be.

326
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,479
<i>Since you're older, you die first,
and I hold a funeral for you.</i>

327
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,732
<i>That's the way it should be, right?</i>

328
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,235
<i>You tried to stab me,</i>

329
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,154
shoot me, drown me,

330
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,656
kill me with cinnamon
and a lethal injection…

331
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,075
And my sister…

332
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:19,873
Just wait.

333
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,792
I'll return every bit of it.

334
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,421
Unbelievable.

335
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,632
Fine, you son of a bitch!

336
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,427
I still want you dead this very second!

337
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,224
But I have nothing to do

338
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,976
with your sister's death.

339
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,104
How about Yeo Eunnam?

340
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,357
<i>What about my niece-in-law?</i>

341
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,652
Hey, Seo Dongju! You son of a…

342
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,654
He hung up.

343
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,780
Hung up?

344
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,824
This bastard…

345
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,577
That punk's got some nerve.

346
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,677
Administrator?

347
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:18,223
Put Yeo Eunnam on hold for now.
We'll take care of her later.

348
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,353
Find Seo Dongju as soon as possible
and finish him off at all cost.

349
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,732
<i>Too bad. This isn't
the Administrator, it's Seo Dongju.</i>

350
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,486
I can't exactly kill myself,
can I, Mr. Yeom?

351
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,208
The Administrator's down too.

352
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,211
Why did he go to Seo Dongju
at a time like this?

353
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,507
Maybe he was trying
to get revenge for Cho Yangchun.

354
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,633
Bunch of idiots.

355
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,510
The country's fate is at stake,

356
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,804
and they're wasting time
on personal revenge.

357
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,017
Wait…

358
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,646
Seo Dongju was stabbed
before he lost his memory, right?

359
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,608
Was he faking amnesia this whole time?

360
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,569
He ate the cinnamon
without knowing it was dangerous, sir.

361
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,905
If he knew
and still ate the cookies to fool us,

362
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,910
then he's one ruthless bastard,
risking his life for the act.

363
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,749
Dongju, that bastard…

364
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,961
He must've killed Huh Ildo,
the Administrator, and Gilbin.

365
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,341
Now, I'm next?

366
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:53,151
So, you opened your car to go home
and found a man asleep in the backseat.

367
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,154
You recognized him as the man
following you from the restaurant.

368
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,989
And you reported him for stalking?

369
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,074
Yes.

370
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,701
I came out after hiding in the kitchen

371
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,912
and found him in my car.

372
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,207
You must've been scared.
We'll contact you if we need more details.

373
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,042
Thank you.

374
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,580
<i>Dongju,</i>

375
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,541
<i>don't worry about me.</i>

376
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,753
<i>I'll be at the safest place.</i>

377
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,094
Over there.

378
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,345
Turn right at the end!

379
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,848
Do you know how many times
we've been down this alley?

380
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,891
We've been here before?

381
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:08,017
Yes.

382
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,144
I see.

383
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,895
Still, turn right.

384
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,189
Jeez.

385
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,278
Turn right here!

386
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,493
Turn right again!

387
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,545
Turn right one more time!

388
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,806
Now…

389
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,185
we turn right next!

390
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,609
Turn right!

391
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,325
Turn right straight ahead!

392
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,497
What?

393
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,415
Old man, get down.

394
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,667
This isn't my house.

395
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,299
Go inside.
The police will help you find your home.

396
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,679
Do you know how many times
we've looped around?

397
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,182
Taking right turns after right turns,
looping back to the same spots.

398
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,935
We even crossed the Han River twice.

399
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,771
Got it, no more right turns.

400
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
Do you mean it?

401
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,983
Yes, get back on.

402
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,486
Turn left!

403
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,998
What about Dad?

404
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,708
Not yet.

405
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,544
Go inside and rest for a bit.

406
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,090
Deokhui!

407
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,884
I couldn't find him.

408
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,763
He wasn't hungry and barely ate dinner.

409
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,348
Exactly.

410
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,476
I'm worried that he collapsed
somewhere from exhaustion.

411
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,353
Taeyun,

412
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,063
call the police.

413
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,982
Deokhui!

414
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,776
If the police get involved,
the media will catch wind,

415
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,945
and Daesan stock will go into free fall.

416
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:17,999
We're home!

417
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,293
My goodness. That's the chairman.

418
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,794
What?

419
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,425
If this is actually his house,
that's insane.

420
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,802
Sir, I know this place!

421
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,888
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

422
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,853
Grandfather!

423
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,107
Hey! You remember me?

424
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,569
Yeah, from back when Dongju…

425
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,030
That's right, I'm Ji Seonu.

426
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,159
Hey! We found Father!

427
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,911
Get back quickly, honey.

428
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,332
That was fun,
but a shame it had to end.

429
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,793
You came to see Director Seo last time.

430
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,877
Yes.

431
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,962
You're right.

432
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,256
Mom, you remember Ji Seonu, right?

433
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,925
Hello.

434
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,302
Father.

435
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,887
Father?

436
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,472
Are you okay?

437
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,057
Grandfather.

438
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,601
Mom was worried sick about you.

439
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,481
Who are you to worry about me?

440
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,069
My son got me home just fine.

441
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,737
No need for all that concern.

442
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,575
Father, what's wrong with you?

443
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,077
Taeyun,

444
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,912
take your grandfather inside.

445
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,664
Yes, Mom.

446
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,001
Turn right!

447
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,547
Sir, the endless right turns are over.
Time to go in.

448
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,465
- Is it over?
- Yes.

449
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,550
Father!

450
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,387
- My goodness, Father.
- Honey!

451
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,683
Why didn't you tell us
until he got this bad?

452
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,934
What's wrong?

453
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,730
He doesn't recognize us!
He asked my sister who she was!

454
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,901
Father, let's go inside.

455
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:09,986
Okay.

456
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,071
Wait.

457
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,240
My son should come in too.

458
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,366
Come in.

459
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,494
I'm not your son.

460
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,579
What?

461
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,747
Taeyun.

462
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,416
- Well…
- Let's go, Grandfather.

463
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,585
Wait, hold on…

464
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,423
But…

465
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,011
where did the chairman
dig up this long-lost son?

466
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,763
Seriously, just come here.

467
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,141
It was just a joke.

468
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,018
Now's not the time for jokes.

469
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,895
- I can't even joke now?
- Gosh.

470
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,021
Thank you.

471
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,105
It's nothing.

472
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,275
Ma'am, hold on.

473
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,117
You said
Dongju stops by here sometimes, right?

474
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,079
Can you give this to him?

475
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,040
I baked these cookies myself.

476
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,334
I ran into the old man
on my way here to drop them off.

477
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,090
Thank you.

478
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,009
I'll come back later
for the shoes he's wearing.

479
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,555
Don't bother.
I'll send them to your bakery.

480
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,141
Do you know our bakery?

481
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,311
No, I don't.

482
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,107
Then I'll come back for them.

483
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,733
To see Dongju too.

484
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,629
PROSECUTION SERVICE

485
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,593
PROSECUTOR YEOM HUICHEOL

486
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,699
Yes, Prosecutor Yeom speaking.

487
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:22,869
What?

488
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,416
How did you know I was here?

489
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,670
You once told me
you worked all night after we fought.

490
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,924
I took a guess and came, and I was right.

491
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,932
Let's go home together.

492
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,226
If we go home together…

493
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,607
will you take back the divorce?

494
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,737
Your uncle's asking for you.

495
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,120
I'll go get my stuff.

496
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,018
HOUSE OF OVERFLOW

497
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,790
Uncle, I'm here.

498
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,083
Okay, hold on.

499
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,128
I heard you were looking for me.

500
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,340
I never called for you.
Your aunt said that?

501
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,884
No, my wife did.

502
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,930
She showed up at my office
saying you needed to see me.

503
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,974
Is that so?

504
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,685
Where is she now?

505
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,811
She came in with me.

506
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,106
She came into my house?

507
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,275
Yes, Uncle.

508
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,738
Your wife must've been mistaken.

509
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,073
Go to bed.

510
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,200
All right. Good night, then.

511
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,285
Okay.

512
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:36,544
Guho, you heard what
that wretched woman did, didn't you?

513
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,798
Yeom Huicheol, long time no see.

514
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,258
You bastard…

515
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,051
Why are you… Hey.

516
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,013
You shouldn't be stuttering
as a prosecutor.

517
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,556
Yeah, I got discharged.

518
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,684
Figured I'd drop by
and say hi to your dear uncle. Happy now?

519
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,561
Go on, then.

520
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,174
Guho, the gun.

521
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,391
Guho, shoot him!

522
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,813
Shoot him!

523
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:42,234
I said, shoot him!

524
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:48,949
Give me the gun.

525
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,203
<i>Jangseon, stop it already.</i>

526
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,747
PRESIDENT LEE CHEOLYONG

527
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,374
It's The Elder, sir.

528
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,627
<i>Jangseon, please.</i>

529
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:04,590
<i>You're shaving years off my life.
I won't even survive my term at this rate.</i>

530
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,674
Brother.

531
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,676
If you so much as fire a shot,

532
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,596
I'll send special forces
to wipe out the House of Overflow.

533
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,890
Special forces? That won't cut it!

534
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,392
Send the army instead!

535
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,646
Darn it.

536
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,574
Sir, rest assured.
Everything is under control now.

537
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,879
<i>Jangseon, from now on,
let Director Seo handle the money.</i>

538
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:44,964
TO THE ELDER

539
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,218
He could have just run off
with the Swiss account funds.

540
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,512
But look what he did instead.

541
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:56,517
<i>He brought all that money back
and asked to help him make peace with you.</i>

542
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,812
<i>He survived all kinds
of life-threatening situations</i>

543
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,441
<i>and went through hell just to meet me.</i>

544
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,234
<i>Isn't that so commendable?</i>

545
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,862
<i>Jangseon.</i>

546
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,072
If you make
Director Seo's life difficult again,

547
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,242
I'll take it
as a declaration of war against me.

548
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,830
<i>Director Seo.</i>

549
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,124
Yes, sir.

550
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,002
<i>I set it up
for you two to make up today.</i>

551
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,045
<i>Now, you handle the rest.</i>

552
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,940
If you push
Yeom Jangseon too far, it could backfire.

553
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,942
I had no choice.

554
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,654
The Swiss account
is in Seo Dongju's hands.

555
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:51,864
Seo Dongju…

556
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,075
is the last person we should trust.

557
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,288
Did I ever say…

558
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,582
I trust Seo Dongju?

559
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,796
He found this place
and managed to meet me.

560
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,258
He's a dangerous guy.

561
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,060
Do you remember?

562
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,022
You wanted me dead…

563
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,024
But I…

564
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,944
I want you dead, but you want to live.

565
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,988
We've both laid our cards on the table.

566
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:37,618
If I was going to spare you if you begged,
I wouldn't have started this at all.

567
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:42,081
You said begging wouldn't work,
so I handed over 39 billion won.

568
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,166
So why did you try to kill me?

569
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,877
I didn't order the sea shooting.

570
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:51,590
President Huh desperately wanted you gone
for his son's future.

571
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:57,304
You even brought in The Elder
to make up with me.

572
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,306
Why are you bringing up the past?

573
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,183
This isn't reconciliation.
It's a ceasefire.

574
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,979
Reconciliation means ending the war.

575
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,856
But I have no intention of ending it.

576
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,694
What do you want, Director Seo?

577
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,198
Revenge.

578
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,790
You little bastard!
You're holding on to my gun.

579
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,460
Go ahead and shoot me.

580
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,212
Shoot me.

581
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,340
I'll take my time.

582
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,551
What?

583
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,387
Take your time?

584
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,471
Yes.

585
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,765
I'll kill you…

586
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,186
when your life is worth enough

587
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,856
to satisfy my revenge.

588
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,824
Why are you so late?

589
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,419
Why aren't you sleeping?

590
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,590
I can't sleep.

591
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,720
Then why not have a drink instead of tea?

592
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,601
If I start drinking,
I don't think I'll be able to stop.

593
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,441
My father…

594
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,321
wandered out barefoot,

595
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,702
not knowing where home was,
before finally making his way back.

596
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,165
You knew about this.

597
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,795
I was going to tell you,

598
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,589
but I didn't want to shock you.

599
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,469
Everyone went out searching for him.

600
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,723
But…

601
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:50,060
Do you know
who found and brought him home?

602
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,232
Ji Yeongsu's son,

603
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:58,527
Ji Seonu.

604
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,161
Apparently, he ran into my father.

605
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,206
He was on his way to drop off
a gift for Director Seo.

606
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,169
Sitting here,

607
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,255
drinking tea and…

608
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,675
waiting for you…

609
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,434
"I want my husband to kill Seo Dongju."

610
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,397
I was thinking to myself.

611
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,864
<i>Look who it is.</i>

612
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,199
<i>Director Seo!</i>

613
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:49,369
Secretary Gong! Come here!
Director Seo is here.

614
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:55,667
I'm fully recovered and discharged.

615
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,170
Well done, Director Seo.

616
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,215
The chairman worried about you every day.

617
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:02,925
Director Seo,

618
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,720
you had me so worried,
I nearly lost my way home.

619
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,224
It didn't last long. He's much better now.

620
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,644
All right. Come on in.

621
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,856
Tell Chef Do to bring out
something nourishing for Director Seo.

622
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,149
Let's go.

623
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,202
You…

624
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,329
What did you just say?

625
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:36,208
I said I'll expedite bringing
Ji Seonu into the family.

626
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,795
Hey, Director Seo…

627
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:42,464
You're finally back!

628
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,072
Dad!

629
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:13,036
I told you not to drive
after a night shift.

630
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,249
What's so funny?

631
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,085
The whole drive here,

632
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,796
I tried to remember

633
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,048
what you kept nagging me about.

634
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,133
What is it?

635
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,093
I couldn't remember and gave up.

636
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,345
Turns out it was exactly this.

637
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,180
"Don't drive after a night shift."

638
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,558
Jeez.

639
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,271
Yes?

640
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,772
Yes, Dr. Kang.

641
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,983
The caregiver says

642
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,653
the patient went home last night.

643
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,866
So I checked,
but his discharge hasn't been decided.

644
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,909
Yes.

645
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,245
Understood.

646
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,626
Dr. Kang says she'll handle it.

647
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:03,879
Then, can I pack up and leave?

648
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:04,963
Yes.

649
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,354
Chairman.

650
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,147
Where's Director Seo?

651
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,233
Oh, he went to see Ildo.

652
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,280
DR. KANG IHYEON

653
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,618
Yes, Dr. Kang.

654
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,039
Yes, Chairman.

655
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,167
Yes.

656
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,088
Yes, I'll do that then.

657
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:48,882
Yes.

658
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,891
The rice pot's on.
Go to bed after you eat.

659
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,851
Sure.

660
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,480
Looks like someone got you that gift.

661
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,731
The tablet.

662
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,025
Yes, it's from my daughter.

663
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,238
You don't have to go back to work?

664
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,449
That was a long call.
I thought they called you back.

665
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,327
Calls like that are short.

666
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,079
"Dr. Kang! Hurry!"

667
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,957
Then I have to run out
without time to respond.

668
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,378
That's how I make money
and got you that tablet.

669
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:31,091
This time, don't lose it.
Take good care of it, Dad.

670
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,720
If I do,
my daughter will just get me another.

671
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,307
Oh, right. Show me how to transfer photos

672
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,977
from my phone to the tablet.

673
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,062
- Again?
- I always forget.

674
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,147
Gosh.

675
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,983
- Look carefully.
- Okay.

676
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,901
- Open your album.
- Okay.

677
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,239
Select the photos you want to move…

678
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,365
Wait…

679
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,660
Looks like this was taken
with a film camera.

680
00:58:58,744 --> 00:58:59,745
Yes.

681
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,580
Wow.

682
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,331
Mr. Huh was

683
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,293
quite handsome even when he was young.

684
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,503
Who? The guy holding the kid?

685
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,505
- Yes.
- That's not Ildo.

686
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,798
Ildo…

687
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,884
is the one at the end.

688
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,220
That one is Yeo Sunho, Cha Deokhui's…

689
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:21,308
Anyway, he was around.

690
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,851
Why the past tense?

691
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,436
He died in a car accident.

692
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,064
That's why I keep telling you
not to drive at dawn.

693
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,984
The rice is ready.

694
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,361
I was waiting to say I'm returning
to the chairman's office tomorrow.

695
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,953
There was no need to come
all the way to my room for that.

696
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,082
Actually, I need to tell you
something privately.

697
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,590
President Huh,

698
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:37,926
you attempted to kill me.

699
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,053
That makes you an attempted murderer.

700
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,348
From now on,

701
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,018
I'll be making good use of that weakness.

702
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,649
Buried Hearts

703
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:39,696
{\an8}All this happened because you couldn't
get rid of that rat, Seo Dongju.

704
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,157
{\an8}<i>If I take over Daesan Group,</i>

705
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,785
{\an8}<i>The Elder will have no reason
to stick with Director Seo.</i>

706
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,163
{\an8}If you put your trust in Director Seo,

707
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,624
{\an8}<i>I will have you and your son
disappear without a trace.</i>

708
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,834
{\an8}Ever heard of the Dandelion Team?

709
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,502
{\an8}<i>Ask Yeom Jangseon about it.</i>

710
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,881
{\an8}<i>While the Administrator secured
the Dandelion files, Seo Dongju caught on.</i>

711
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,801
{\an8}He said there were such dangerous files,
but he couldn't destroy the original.

712
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,764
I know about your father very well.
