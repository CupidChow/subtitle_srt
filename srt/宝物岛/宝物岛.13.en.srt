00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,262
{\an8}Did the letter get delivered?

6
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,391
{\an8}Yes, Director Seo took it from the mailbox
and brought it into his house.

7
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,995
RECIPIENT: SEO DONGJU

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>That letter</i>

9
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,916
is my final message
to Seo Dongju on his way out.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,592
I'm stepping out for a bit…

11
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,566
Honey.

12
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,485
Why are the lights off?

13
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,410
The light was bothering me.

14
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,710
Is something wrong?

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,421
Honey.

16
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,175
What if…

17
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,428
Just what if…

18
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
If that child survived back then…

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,853
If he were alive

20
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,773
and tried to ruin Taeyun's future…

21
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,363
could you kill him again?

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,991
Of course.

23
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,952
As many times as needed.

24
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,873
Back then, I did it for you.

25
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,126
Now, I'd do it for you and Taeyun.

26
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,595
That child is Director Seo, honey.

27
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,687
That bastard got to you too?

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,481
Did you…

29
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,734
know about this?

30
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,294
{\an8}DONGJU

31
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,422
{\an8}<i>Dongju, let's meet now.</i>

32
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,215
<i>I'll head over to your place…</i>

33
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>Another leg surgery?</i>

34
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,077
There's still a third surgery left.

35
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,997
Hmm.

36
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,874
This is all because of Yeo Sunho.

37
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,462
If he hadn't stirred up Chu Gyeongwon,
none of this would have happened.

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,172
It's…

39
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,383
because I failed to persuade Gyeongwon.

40
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,135
Failed?

41
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,222
You got Chu Gyeongwon to shut up.
And Yeo Sunho too.

42
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,518
That's why
I'm planning to give you a medal.

43
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,563
I don't need any medals.

44
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,109
You might change your mind
once you hear what kind of medal it is.

45
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,656
How about the late Yeo Sunho's place?

46
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,538
Becoming Daesan Group's eldest son-in-law.

47
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,373
Go have a son.

48
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,418
He'll be the future chairman
of Daesan Group.

49
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,009
I've never once considered that.

50
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,719
Come on.

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,890
I know you've had your eye
on that position.

52
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,643
For you to claim that medal,

53
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,729
I'll try to make Chairman Cha Gangcheon
accept you.

54
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,107
<i>So,</i>

55
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,443
<i>they never found
the body of Gyeongwon's child?</i>

56
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,904
<i>It was a small child.</i>

57
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,241
<i>A wild animal might have carried it off.</i>

58
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,578
That doesn't matter.

59
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,871
What's important is

60
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,749
how we will dedicate ourselves
to the future of this country together.

61
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,549
Now, go inside and get yourself treated.

62
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,135
Yes, Prosecutor.

63
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,724
Ildo.

64
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,020
Use those crutches too much,
and you'll strain your ribs.

65
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,479
Don't move around too much.

66
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,746
Hello, sir.

67
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,836
Ildo's hospital room is bugged.

68
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,296
Keep a close watch.

69
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,174
If he has a change of heart
and decides to confess, we're screwed.

70
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,427
He killed his friend,
lover, and own son in one blow.

71
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,678
What change of heart?

72
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,806
Don't say that. He's unaware of it.

73
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>Unaware that it's his son?</i>

74
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,313
<i>He opposed the birth,
so the child was kept a secret.</i>

75
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,815
<i>Since the kid
kept asking for his dad,</i>

76
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,069
<i>Chu Gyeongwon said she'd reveal
the child's existence to Huh Ildo.</i>

77
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,737
<i>Is that so?</i>

78
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,782
Then she died before she could tell him.

79
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,785
Gosh.

80
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,331
Jangseon.

81
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,625
You pushed too hard with this deal.

82
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,378
The export CEO in China

83
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,714
was exchanging letters and phone calls
with a North Korean woman.

84
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,467
Turning this in for an NSA violation
would've been easier.

85
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,594
Don't be so naive.

86
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,596
We need to keep a tight grip

87
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,516
so no one dares suggest
downsizing the counterintelligence team.

88
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,934
RECORDED AUDIO

89
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>A former activist-turned-spy
who got recruited</i>

90
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>while working undercover at a factory
run by a South Korean agent</i>

91
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,817
<i>in league with North Korea…</i>

92
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,655
<i>If she testified about
the CEO's espionage in full detail…</i>

93
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,325
<i>It would've been
a perfect setup.</i>

94
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,080
This all happened because you failed
to train Chu Gyeongwon properly.

95
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,960
You were so proud
of how close you'd gotten to her.

96
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,131
When she refused a press conference,
we should've dropped it,

97
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,551
before it turned into a bloodbath.

98
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,514
We can't pick and choose our battles
when serving our country.

99
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,474
We have to push through the obstacles.

100
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,938
Why don't you clock out first?

101
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,694
Oh, right.

102
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,321
The boy who died,

103
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,490
<i>his name was Chu Seonghyeon.</i>

104
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,325
<i>My goodness.</i>

105
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,828
<i>He almost became Huh Seonghyeon.</i>

106
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,708
<i>Still, he didn't know it was his son.
Doesn't it make it less tragic?</i>

107
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,057
President Huh!

108
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,115
President Huh!

109
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,326
Director Seo, I'm here!

110
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,999
Yes, I'll head over.

111
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,088
So this is Seo Dongju's last dance.

112
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:36,052
{\an8}HUH ILDO

113
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,428
Ildo, don't shoot him.

114
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,931
Seo Dongju is your son.

115
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,704
What are you doing? I'm not dead yet.

116
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,124
Hurry and keep shooting, Father.

117
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,433
What?

118
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,072
You bastard.

119
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,034
What the hell are you up to this time?

120
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,286
Shoot already, Father.

121
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,624
- Don't play games with me!
- Just kill me already!

122
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,094
<i>Ildo, don't shoot him.</i>

123
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,429
<i>Seo Dongju is your son.</i>

124
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,479
Get rid of Seo Dongju now!

125
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,064
The team's on the ground.

126
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,833
Dad, no!

127
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,469
Dongju, did you get shot?

128
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,217
Get lost.

129
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,643
Chief Cheon, what should we do?

130
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
Pull back.

131
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,365
Damn it.

132
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,411
Damn.

133
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,474
Dongju.

134
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,896
Let's get you to the hospital.

135
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,917
Gosh, that freaking idiot.

136
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,925
<i>Dad, you should leave.</i>

137
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,969
<i>We found a hospital.</i>

138
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,763
Got it…

139
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,432
Taeyun, I…

140
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,612
<i>Ildo, call me.</i>

141
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,863
KANG SEONG

142
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,156
<i>I think</i>

143
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,868
<i>Director Seo is your son.</i>

144
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,639
PARK SURGICAL CLINIC

145
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,182
SURGERY ROOM

146
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,356
I'll check the vitals.

147
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,149
Go get some rest.

148
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,069
Sure. And you're welcome.

149
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:13,407
No need to keep thanking me
over something this small, Mr. Bae.

150
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,206
Right! I forgot to thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Park.

151
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,582
Let go of me.

152
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,127
What's wrong with my life?
How did I get mixed up with you?

153
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,966
Nurse Bae. I could see you still got it.

154
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,094
Just sort out your affairs
and get back to work.

155
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,388
I really want to go back too.

156
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,098
Anyway, thanks again.

157
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,352
Dongju…

158
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,562
Is he okay?

159
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,564
Of course.

160
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:48,276
If not, we'll have to take him
to a big hospital.

161
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,279
And if we do, they'll report the gunshot.
Then Huh Ildo will be…

162
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,488
I'm still talking.

163
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,918
Your days of staring out the window
while doing pull-ups are numbered.

164
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,311
I heard everything.

165
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,983
You can say that to me,

166
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,445
but don't tell President Huh you did.

167
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,074
He wants to be a good father in your eyes.

168
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,743
Saying your heart

169
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,204
must be torn to shreds

170
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,750
wouldn't even begin to cover it, right?

171
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,088
Thanks for understanding.

172
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,717
Dongju.

173
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,929
Can't you just leave Daesan, Dongju?

174
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,352
Taeyun.

175
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,479
Pick one.

176
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,440
Either understand me

177
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,401
or tell me to leave Daesan.

178
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,611
Just choose one.

179
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>You can hate me and curse me if you want.</i>

180
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,586
I'm sorry, Dongju.

181
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,509
I'll never forget what Dad did to you.

182
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:25,725
Seong!

183
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,601
Seong!

184
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,186
Seong!

185
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,646
Yes, Ildo. Have a seat.

186
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,814
What?

187
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,442
You didn't tell me this whole time.

188
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,445
What is this nonsense now?

189
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,157
Ildo.

190
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,745
Gyeongwon's kid…

191
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,663
He's your son.

192
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,417
- Gyeongwon…
- "Ildo, this kid is your son."

193
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,918
Just say it confidently.

194
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,964
Won't it be too shocking?

195
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,924
He said he didn't want the kid.

196
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,301
If you won't do it, I will.

197
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,554
I'll tell him.

198
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,432
He hates people knowing his business.

199
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,309
Just stay out of it.

200
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,562
You have no idea

201
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,690
how actively I've been staying out of it.

202
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,817
What do you mean?

203
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,611
Mom.

204
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,406
My stomach hurts. I need to poop.

205
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,742
Right. Let's go to the bathroom.

206
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,958
About Gyeongwon…

207
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,668
What do you mean?

208
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,378
Did you hear that?

209
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,463
Yeah.

210
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,509
Just let Gyeongwon handle it
and stay out of it.

211
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,770
<i>That means…</i>

212
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,149
<i>Sunho knew that Gyeongwon's kid…</i>

213
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,737
was my son.

214
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,493
All this while…

215
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,747
Why didn't you tell me until now?

216
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,208
You know, Ildo…

217
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,462
I don't think knowing the truth

218
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,633
is always a good thing.

219
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,386
Some truths…

220
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,389
can hurt a person
just as much as violence.

221
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,892
It wasn't just Sunho.

222
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,354
Your child and the mother of your child
died too.

223
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,190
That's why I didn't tell you.

224
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,599
Take it slow.

225
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,229
Taeyun.

226
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,191
You should go back home.

227
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,485
I'll follow and take care of you.

228
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,198
I'll look after him, so you can go home.

229
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,825
- Still…
- Taeyun.

230
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,244
You make me uncomfortable.

231
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,580
Go home.

232
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:31,822
Wow.

233
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,908
Ildo, you're pretty good.

234
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,162
Deokhui set it up for me,

235
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,289
but I've never used it.

236
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,418
She probably did it for your health.
Why not use it?

237
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,045
I'm not interested.

238
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,798
I'm planning to throw it out
when Deokhui's not around.

239
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,218
- And what if she throws you out instead?
- Gosh.

240
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,928
That can't happen.

241
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,269
Hey, Sunho.

242
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,606
About that favor I asked…

243
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm sorry, Ildo.

244
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,071
I'm not asking for all
of Daesan Apparel's production lines.

245
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,989
Just a portion
of the dress shirt export line

246
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,575
for my father's sewing factory.

247
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,494
Is it that hard?

248
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,622
That's not it, Ildo.

249
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,794
Ever since I married Deokhui,
I've been getting favors left and right.

250
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,422
I even refused my father when he asked me
to sell his land to Daesan.

251
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,590
That is

252
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:35,052
what I should do
as the group's eldest son-in-law.

253
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,178
Hey, Sunho.

254
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:41,100
If this doesn't work out,
my father's factory will shut down.

255
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,143
Please help me out.

256
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,938
Please. If you do, I'll owe you big time...

257
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,898
Just let it go, Ildo.

258
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,027
I'm sorry.

259
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,244
Then, why did you ask to meet today?

260
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,914
Ildo.

261
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,459
I know you're close
with Prosecutor Yeom Jangseon.

262
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,670
You need to stop.

263
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,966
You mapped out
our school's underground group for him.

264
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,554
But he got leverage over you
and has controlled you ever since.

265
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,139
- You…
- That's enough.

266
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,435
You know I got beaten half to death
because I never gave up a single name.

267
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,313
You got out in return
for giving Yeom Jangseon the names.

268
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,315
I knew all along.

269
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,071
You bastard.

270
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,243
Why are you bringing this up now?

271
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,832
I'm not blaming you
for what happened back then.

272
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,793
Honestly, I can't say I would've held out

273
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,837
without giving up my friends' names
if I were you.

274
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,550
But, Ildo, sticking with someone
like Yeom Jangseon now is different

275
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,554
from giving in to torture
and drawing that chart.

276
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,350
It's like throwing your beliefs
straight into the gutter.

277
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,312
The pure and righteous Sunho…

278
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:13,317
If you're so clean,
why'd you have a kid out of wedlock?

279
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,194
What are you talking about?

280
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,404
Gyeongwon's kid.

281
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,075
You crazy bastard. Gyeongwon's…

282
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,414
Forget it.
Let's talk about this another time.

283
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,540
Suit yourself.

284
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,754
As long as you stay out of my way,
I don't care about your affairs.

285
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,950
He completely freaked out.

286
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,246
Deokhui, I think you've got it wrong.

287
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,875
You know how stubborn Sunho is.

288
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,295
Even in college,
he never admitted to any mistakes.

289
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:20,300
I feel like
killing myself with Eunnam.

290
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,385
Deokhui.

291
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,887
Just thinking about
Gyeongwon's child suffocates me.

292
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,684
There's no way out except death.

293
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,689
It's my fault.

294
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,733
I should have married you back then.

295
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,362
I'm paying for it now.

296
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,615
What do I do now?

297
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,100
Dad. I just got back.

298
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,563
I know it's not what you want,
but Dongju's treatment went well.

299
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,441
I see. Taeyun, come in. Let's talk…

300
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,169
Why does this rice cake taste off?
It's too sweet and salty.

301
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,589
I took your advice,
seasoned it stronger, and ruined it.

302
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,965
- Gosh.
- Jeez.

303
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,218
You need to get with the times.

304
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,012
The new madam used to be an anchor.

305
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,433
To satisfy her refined palate,
your old-fashioned flavors won't do.

306
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,144
I'm only here
because I cater to the chairman's taste.

307
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,730
Now I'm supposed to cater to her instead?

308
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,940
No way. That's not happening.

309
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,484
How many times must I say this?

310
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,652
You think this is just about her?

311
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,781
It's about the chairman's only son.

312
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,157
Here we go again…

313
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,537
The moment the new madam returns
from their honeymoon in Jeju,

314
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,790
the balance of power will shift.

315
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,086
Wait…

316
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:22,589
I already cleaned the chairman's bedroom
and the rooms upstairs.

317
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,840
Did you go over them again?

318
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,010
Dust already settled on the window frames.

319
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,596
Can I have more of that?

320
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,764
What?

321
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,848
From before…

322
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,475
Gosh…

323
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,018
Secretary Gong.

324
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,938
This falls under my responsibility.

325
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,356
- Not Chef Do's.
- My goodness.

326
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,109
Just ask me anytime.

327
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,737
Can I have one too?

328
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,201
Do you have more?

329
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,995
Sure. No need to worry at all.

330
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,972
Do you need anything?

331
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,727
How many days has it been?

332
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,773
He hasn't stepped outside since the day
after the chairman's wedding.

333
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,192
A full seven days…

334
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,868
He left it right by the door.

335
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:36,997
He didn't even touch it.

336
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,418
I can't help
if I don't know what's going on.

337
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,215
Dongju.

338
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,310
Close the door.

339
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,794
Gosh.

340
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,476
My bad upbringing
makes times like this easier.

341
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,647
I got no manners anyway,
so I can just walk in as I please.

342
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,403
"I'm not dead yet."

343
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,281
"Hurry and keep shooting, Father."

344
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,203
I never imagined you'd lock yourself away

345
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,540
for this long just because of those words.

346
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:09,506
Don't tell me this is some act
to show you're suffering more than me.

347
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,553
I brought something with me.

348
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,100
You don't seem like you'll come.

349
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,852
I'll drag my aching leg over instead.

350
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,526
Huh Ildo and Seo Dongju.

351
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,196
A DNA test result for the two of us.

352
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,286
Your DNA sample

353
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,707
came from a toothbrush
you used at the office.

354
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,792
And the results…

355
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,798
As expected, the results confirm
a father-son relationship.

356
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,883
See for yourself.

357
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,772
Wow. This is so ridiculous
that I can't help but laugh.

358
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,699
HUH ILDO, SEO DONGJU

359
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,868
Why are you doing this?

360
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,997
This isn't because you called me "Father."

361
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,169
Now get out.

362
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,463
This is good.

363
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,007
Actually, on my way here,

364
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:39,387
I was thinking about how I'd respond
if you begged for forgiveness.

365
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,933
But since you're quite the opposite,
I don't have to think about it anymore.

366
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,322
<i>Just like we did earlier, Mom.</i>

367
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,201
Like this?

368
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,997
<i>That day
before I tried to kill you…</i>

369
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,377
I should have known you were my son.

370
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,129
If you had known,

371
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,258
- would you have not killed me?
- No.

372
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,180
Even if I had known,
I still would have killed you.

373
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,774
So, after locking yourself
up here for a week,

374
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,278
the best you came up with
is acting like an even bigger villain?

375
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:41,491
I became Daesan Group's eldest son-in-law
by killing my own child.

376
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,287
If I had embraced being
an untouchable villain from the start,

377
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,084
I wouldn't have failed
when I shot you out on the water.

378
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,504
Even if I had failed back then,

379
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,174
calling me your father
won't change a thing.

380
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm a man
who's already killed his own child.

381
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,268
I never would have stopped shooting.

382
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,361
If I continued…

383
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,868
you wouldn't be here
holding me accountable.

384
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,077
And more than anything,

385
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,956
I wouldn't be trapped
under Yeom Jangseon's thumb.

386
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,545
I'd be the one controlling him.

387
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,215
So you're saying…

388
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:45,638
it would've been better if you knew
I was your son when you killed me?

389
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,933
That not knowing…

390
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,728
is the only regret?

391
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,815
Impressive.

392
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,277
Begging for forgiveness would be better.

393
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,447
Honestly, from where I stand,

394
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,701
the only thing you could do right now

395
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,164
is beg for forgiveness.

396
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,126
Of course, I won't forgive you,

397
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,588
but at least beg for forgiveness

398
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,467
from my late mother and Yeo Sunho.

399
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,810
I pushed my own child off with a car

400
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,730
and shot him three times.

401
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,193
The last bullet…

402
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,323
He came to tell me…

403
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,287
"I'm your son, Father."

404
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,337
But I shot him.

405
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,343
From where and how…

406
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,264
do I even begin to apologize?

407
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,064
That's something
you have to figure out yourself.

408
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,661
Taeyun is really worried about you.

409
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,873
He's afraid…

410
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,377
you might take your own life.

411
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,341
Don't let that happen.

412
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,927
That's my request too.

413
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,681
Why would you?

414
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,981
Why would you want me to live?

415
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,343
Dongju.

416
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,637
Is Dad okay?

417
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,599
Dongju.

418
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,851
Are you okay?

419
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,983
Of course. I'm okay.

420
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,820
I took medical leave, got treated,
and now I can even drive.

421
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,990
Did something happen

422
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,701
with President Huh?

423
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,038
Dongju, I'm scared.

424
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,249
I think President Huh wants to hurt you.

425
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,003
He still has Yeom Jangseon backing him.

426
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:05,922
President Huh…

427
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,467
probably won't anymore.

428
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,053
What makes you so sure of that?

429
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,137
Eunnam,

430
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,851
once I've sorted it all out,
I'll tell you everything.

431
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,980
Just wait a little longer.

432
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,614
Dongju.

433
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,908
I love you.

434
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,620
But lately, it feels like

435
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,124
I'm only loving half of you,
and it scares me.

436
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,005
It's not like the other half
belongs to someone else.

437
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,852
Yangchun, time to eat!

438
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,480
Wow, are they still sleeping?

439
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,691
Yangchun!

440
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,902
Food's here. Your favorite, Yangchun!

441
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
Jeez.

442
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,790
Damn it.

443
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,816
Yes.

444
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,901
<i>Yes, Dongju.</i>

445
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,571
This is bad. Cho Yangchun escaped.

446
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,741
<i>But…</i>

447
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,117
he left the Administrator behind.

448
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,912
Those two won't be able to be together.

449
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:05,041
They lost the Dandelion files,
and Yeom Jangseon abandoned them.

450
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,043
<i>I suppose so.</i>

451
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,171
Let's focus on helping
the Administrator recover.

452
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,297
<i>Got it.</i>

453
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,720
HOUSE OF OVERFLOW

454
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,273
So…

455
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,319
The Administrator
has sided with Seo Dongju.

456
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,949
I fought to the end
and barely managed to escape.

457
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,702
Give me one more chance…

458
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,082
and I'll finish the job properly.

459
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,542
I see. You can go now.

460
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,367
Are you planning to kill yourself?

461
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,007
{\an8}TEST REPORT
EXAMINEES: HUH ILDO, SEO DONGJU

462
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,057
HUH ILDO, SEO DONGJU

463
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,226
PATERNITY PROBABILITY CONFIRMED

464
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,903
No way.

465
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,198
THEREFORE, A BIOLOGICAL FATHER-SON
RELATIONSHIP IS ESTABLISHED

466
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,810
Secretary Gong, can I get some water?

467
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,577
Over the phone, you told me
that Seo Dongju was my son, right?

468
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,371
Yes.

469
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,499
At that exact moment, he called me Father.

470
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,585
Oh?

471
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,128
At the same time?

472
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,757
How coincidental.

473
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,593
When did you find out

474
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,137
that Chu Gyeongwon's child was mine?

475
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,765
I told you to take the shot at Seo Dongju.

476
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,269
Right after that,
I got a call from Cheon Guho.

477
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,648
That's why I yelled over the phone
for you to stop shooting.

478
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,316
Did you really find out then?

479
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,360
- Of course.
- Sir!

480
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,905
Tell me the truth.

481
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,825
I told you, that's when I found out.

482
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,331
By egging a father on…

483
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,086
how much did you enjoy
ordering me to kill my own son?

484
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,059
Damn it.

485
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,231
I picked up a pathetic tailor
who used to scavenge scraps

486
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,152
from fabric markets
to stitch together cheap dress shirts.

487
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,531
And I raised him up to become
a candidate for Daesan Group's chairman.

488
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,992
"Boohoo."

489
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:12,788
"I killed my son multiple times.
It's so painful. Please, pity me."

490
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,334
What a pathetic sight.

491
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,838
Ildo, grow up.

492
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,507
Do you even know who you are?

493
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:28,554
A man so ruthless, he wouldn't hesitate
to kill for his ambitions.

494
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,267
Now you're torn up because
the one you tried to kill was your son?

495
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,894
Boohoo.

496
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,439
You're sad?

497
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:44,028
You're just making a fool of yourself.

498
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,240
All right.

499
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,743
Wipe those tears away.

500
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,953
How do we take Daesan?

501
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,289
- Our goal is...
- Take your hands…

502
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,876
off Daesan.

503
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,173
What did you say?

504
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,219
It's overdue, but I'm finally cutting
the demon Yeom Jangseon out of my life.

505
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,601
Hey. Huh Ildo.

506
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,729
The Daesan chairman seat is within reach,

507
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,940
and you're cutting me off
when I can give you that?

508
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,027
Without me,
you'll never get that position.

509
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,987
I'm siding with Seo Dongju.

510
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,409
What? Seo Dongju?

511
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,701
Yes!

512
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,998
I'll keep pleading with Seo Dongju,

513
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,626
my competent son.

514
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,590
As a father,
I know I'll never be forgiven.

515
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,928
But if I ask him
to build Daesan with me, he'll say yes.

516
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,179
Gosh.

517
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:57,435
I never realized
just how shameless you are.

518
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,479
After realizing I've tried to kill
my own son multiple times,

519
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,233
there's nothing…

520
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,527
I fear

521
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,739
or I can't do now,
Prosecutor Yeom Jangseon.

522
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:11,907
Goodness.

523
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,828
I'm terrified.

524
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,966
Deokhui, I can't be your puppet.

525
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,594
I only dance
when there's a good reason to.

526
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,513
You've always wanted to be
CEO of Daesan Energy.

527
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,098
Not like this.

528
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:41,312
And, Deokhui, I don't know
why you're fighting with Ildo,

529
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,314
but you'd better back down.

530
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,525
We never fight.

531
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,569
Then why are you trying to…

532
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,864
kick him out of Daesan?

533
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,284
Your brother-in-law

534
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,205
is unfit to be Taeyun's father.

535
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,582
What?

536
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,550
They're coming.

537
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,231
Did you take good care of the house?

538
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,108
Thank you for welcoming us.

539
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,194
Welcome, Father.

540
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,488
Yeongsu.

541
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:39,662
From now on, please call me
either "Stepmother" or "Mother."

542
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,998
You two can call me "Grandmother."

543
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,337
Even after 30 years, I still call
my stepfather "President Huh."

544
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,464
Wow, Dongju.

545
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,967
This house is amazing.

546
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,719
Your family lives here too, right?

547
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,640
Seonu, introduce yourself properly.

548
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,482
Thank you for letting me live
in this amazing house, sir.

549
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,402
Seonu, you should call him "Father."

550
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,028
It's fine.

551
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,323
He can call me whatever he wants.

552
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:21,161
That doesn't change the fact
that I'm Seonu's father.

553
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,789
Secretary Gong.

554
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,416
Yes, Chairman.

555
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,709
What's for breakfast today?

556
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,380
You'll get Seonu
something good to eat, right?

557
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,592
Seonu, come eat breakfast.

558
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,385
Father, look at the time.

559
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,554
It's dinnertime.

560
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,055
- Dinnertime?
- Yes.

561
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,974
Yeongsu.

562
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,608
Do you know why I didn't fight harder
against your marriage?

563
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:56,614
Because I'd rather have you caged in here
than running wild outside.

564
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,868
Smile. Keep it together.

565
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,622
You're the one who broke the promise

566
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:08,709
to stay away
from the Daesan family for good

567
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,797
at the cost of your lives.

568
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:14,882
Don't forget that.

569
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,140
<i>You must</i>

570
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,601
keep your promise to protect

571
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,895
Seonu and me until the end.

572
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,731
Only then can I get into the Daesan family

573
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,984
and cooperate with you, Mr. Yeom.

574
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:35,611
Of course, I'll keep it.

575
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,030
You can rely on me.

576
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,659
Sir, President Huh is here.

577
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,057
Yes, I'm happy.

578
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,394
Director Seo worked hard on our wedding.

579
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,271
You must be glad to have
such a capable grandson.

580
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,859
He'll be a grandson-in-law
in the future.

581
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,114
Haven't you heard anything
from President Huh and Director Seo?

582
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,783
Chairman.

583
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,413
Director Seo is President Huh's son.

584
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:29,665
What…

585
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,375
What do you mean?

586
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,588
What?

587
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,926
Deceiving the head
of the Daesan family like this…

588
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,011
Now that's crossing the line.

589
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:47,015
Why do you think they kept
their father-son relationship a secret?

590
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,730
What if he's keeping Director Seo
close to Cha Seonu…

591
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,067
to take Cha Seonu down eventually?

592
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:00,863
My…

593
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,073
My son, Seonu?

594
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,158
Yes.

595
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,378
You're here.

596
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,463
Yes, Director Seo.

597
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,634
Chairman, your pending approvals
require online authorization.

598
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,011
Hold on.

599
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,554
If it's not urgent, do it later.

600
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,140
We have a guest.

601
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,224
Is it urgent?

602
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,400
No, it's not.

603
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,319
Okay.

604
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,747
It's humiliating for me to admit this,
but I have to tell you.

605
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,875
Director Seo hacked into my computer

606
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,669
and stole the entire
National Patriotism Fund.

607
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,841
That young punk is manipulating

608
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,886
the National Patriotism Fund
as he pleases,

609
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,972
cutting me out,
and now meeting with The Elder directly.

610
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:10,891
Come on.

611
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,769
That can't be right.

612
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,023
And Yeo Eunnam's father, Yeo Sunho.
Huh Ildo…

613
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,946
In your opinion,
what are Seonu's strengths and weaknesses?

614
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,158
It's a bit too early
to discuss that, Chairman.

615
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:16,164
Seonu is like an untouched canvas,

616
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,334
a young man full of endless possibilities.

617
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,754
Endless possibilities…

618
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,424
{\an8}LIQUOR SAFE
INNER SAFE

619
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,759
Later on, when Seonu becomes chairman,

620
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,886
what will you be doing?

621
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,723
Probably like what I'm doing for you now.

622
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,142
Wouldn't I be supporting
Chairman Cha Seonu?

623
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,811
Serving two generations
of Daesan leadership.

624
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,107
Have you ever met your father?

625
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,365
I went to his university
to inform him of my sister's passing,

626
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,576
but he was on sabbatical, so I couldn't.

627
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,453
You should meet him
while he's still alive.

628
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,079
Yes.

629
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,906
I'm coming in.

630
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,921
Y, 1, 10, Y, 1, 10.

631
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,007
9, S, 9, S.

632
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,968
3, 6, 2, 3, 6, 2.

633
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,554
{\an8}♪, W, 7, ♪, W, 7.

634
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,694
<i>Giving him the vault code…</i>

635
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,029
<i>Won't that put you at a disadvantage?</i>

636
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,198
I gave him the old code.

637
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,492
The real passcode

638
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,369
is only in my head.

639
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,579
- You…
- The chairman…

640
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,376
He may be smiling on the outside,
but I can see his condition worsening.

641
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:29,631
Before it gets any worse,
I need to go all-in against Yeom Jangseon.

642
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,677
And I want to know where you'll stand.

643
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,434
I've cut ties with Yeom Jangseon.

644
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,814
That wouldn't have been easy.

645
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,155
I thought you'd become a beast,
but you chose to remain human.

646
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,701
Continuing to follow someone
who orders you to kill your own child…

647
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,121
I thought it was something
even a beast wouldn't do.

648
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,833
Worse than a beast.

649
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,686
Have you secured the vault code?

650
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:28,732
<i>The code Director Seo gave me
matches the one I already had.</i>

651
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,525
<i>It hasn't changed.</i>

652
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:35,197
Chairman, you have to strike
while the iron's hot.

653
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,699
How about tomorrow night?

654
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,035
CHAIRMAN CHA GANGCHEON

655
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,538
Everything you have done
with Yeom Jangseon,

656
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,792
I'll tell the chairman
when he's of sound mind

657
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,877
and remove him from Daesan.

658
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:50,796
I'll tell him myself

659
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,465
what I've done.

660
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,092
Every last detail.

661
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,811
CHAIRMAN

662
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:09,523
Yes, Chairman.

663
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,402
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

664
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:17,072
I'm disappointed
in both you and President Huh.

665
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,117
I can't believe I had to hear from Yeom
that you two are father and son.

666
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,454
<i>I'll visit you
with President Huh and explain.</i>

667
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,958
Then both of you
come by tomorrow night.

668
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,920
<i>No, a conversation like this
calls for drinks.</i>

669
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,881
Let's have a drink, just us three
without Secretary Gong around.

670
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,593
How about we meet at your place?

671
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,555
That sounds good to me, but…

672
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,308
I have a few bottles
of the most expensive wine in the world.

673
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,893
Let's open them tomorrow.

674
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,771
You prepare some food, Director Seo.

675
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,816
Okay.

676
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,373
Come in.

677
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,546
Where's the chairman?

678
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,382
He said he'd be late
and told us to start without him.

679
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,219
Come in.

680
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,088
How about

681
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,091
some soju while we wait?

682
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,145
I'm going to drink up and knock out.

683
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,355
I can't sleep nowadays.

684
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,307
President Huh.

685
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:36,813
I said the only thing left you could do
was beg for forgiveness.

686
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,774
Just forget about it.

687
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:45,613
I'd rather you weren't remorseful
for trying to kill me.

688
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,117
I already said I'd never forgive you,

689
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,038
but seeing you act
all remorseful like this…

690
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,832
It's not exactly easy to ignore it.

691
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,625
Plus, when Chairman Cha arrives,

692
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:01,629
I'm sure he'll tell us
to make amends and get along.

693
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,883
But I have no intention of doing that.

694
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:10,972
Neither do I.

695
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,934
Since the day I pushed

696
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,520
Sunho, Gyeongwon,
and her kid into the river,

697
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,734
I've been careful
never to let myself feel any guilt.

698
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,655
Careful not to let yourself
feel any guilt?

699
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,241
That incident gave me wealth,

700
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,410
family, and status.

701
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,413
If I truly regretted what I did,

702
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,666
I'd have to give all that up.

703
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:42,754
And I didn't want to.

704
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,174
Remorse without sacrifice is fake.

705
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,177
So I forced myself not to regret it.

706
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,473
You're a terrible…

707
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,352
You're truly a horrible bastard.

708
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,525
I figured maybe this was God finally…

709
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,111
punishing me.

710
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:09,322
You're the punishment God sent me.

711
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,574
And you don't have to give anything up?

712
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,092
Want another bottle of soju?

713
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:41,646
QUIETLY IN ONE GO

714
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:50,989
But, President Huh,

715
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:55,869
other than this cost-free repentance,

716
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,247
was there really nothing good for you?

717
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:07,630
Deciding to break free from Yeom Jangseon
and finally stand up to him.

718
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,512
Ever since I got caught in college
and gave up my friends' names,

719
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,597
this is the first time

720
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,516
I've stood up to Yeom Jangseon.

721
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,145
It's all thanks to you.

722
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,774
Though all I did to you
was try to kill you.

723
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,534
God, this conversation…

724
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,579
This is not a father-son talk at all.

725
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,793
If we were

726
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:50,506
a normal father and son,

727
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,220
what kind of conversation would we have?

728
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,684
"Father,

729
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,187
take good care of your health."

730
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,441
"Son, don't skip your meals."

731
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,279
Damn.

732
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,157
Gosh.

733
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,790
Do you think there will come a day…

734
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,337
when we make small talks like that?

735
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,635
Don't even dream of it.

736
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,471
A day like that?

737
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,765
That'll never happen.

738
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,368
I think there's whiskey somewhere.
I'll have to look for it.

739
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,121
Better than going out to buy more.

740
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,897
President Huh!

741
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,733
Please open the door for the chairman!

742
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:41,993
You're here…

743
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,667
Okay.

744
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,963
President Huh, I found the whiskey.

745
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,010
Hi.

746
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,770
Your house is amazing.

747
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,362
President Huh.

748
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,155
- You bastard!
- Are you okay?

749
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,574
President Huh…

750
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,340
Goddamn it!

751
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:41,928
Come here!

752
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,736
Wow, nice! Let's go!

753
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,590
Dongju!

754
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,887
Let's end this, you bastard!

755
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,648
President Huh…

756
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,245
Mister!

757
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,248
<i>What are you doing?
I'm not dead yet.</i>

758
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,834
Hurry and keep shooting, Father.

759
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,127
Father,

760
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,172
take good care of your health.

761
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,409
No, President Huh!

762
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,228
Do you think there will come a day…

763
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,941
<i>when we make small talks like that?</i>
