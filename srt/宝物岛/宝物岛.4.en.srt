No.

6
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,902
Don't do it!

{\an8}EPISODE 4

8
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,093
What are you doing over there?

9
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,679
- Father?
- Shh!

10
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,930
You'll wake Secretary Gong up.

11
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,057
Shush!

12
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,273
You could've just rung the bell
if you needed anything.

13
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,531
Chairman, you shouldn't be drinking.

14
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,205
Sitting here late at night,
slumped over like that...

15
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,875
Just go to bed.

16
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,501
Jeez.

17
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,549
Why is the chairman upset?

18
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,135
He's not angry.

19
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,138
If you're staying,
I'll leave the lights on.

20
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,725
President Huh.

21
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,532
Taking a bath right after eating <i>ramyeon</i>

22
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,826
isn't good for your health, Chairman.

23
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,453
I won't take long.

24
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,831
Reading <i>Myeangsim Bogam</i>
will make me sleepy.

25
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,569
What's got you so deep in thought?

26
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,156
I'm just wondering if I should clear out

27
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,827
all those whiskey bottles.

28
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,081
Mr. Yeom

29
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,167
has his eyes on Daesan Energy.

30
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,337
It's 59.

31
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,049
We have sold off 59 subsidiaries
on Yeom's word,

32
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,301
and now we're down to 37.

33
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,098
That leech has taken so much,
yet he's still chasing money.

34
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,559
Thanks to Mr. Yeom,

35
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,352
we have seamlessly acquired
blue-chip companies.

36
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,312
Daesan's profited a lot from that.

37
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,107
Remember 30 years ago?

38
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,278
When the government privatized
the telecommunications sector.

39
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,906
If we had built Daesan Telecom back then,

40
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,201
we wouldn't still be tied
to that bastard Yeom.

41
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,415
He promised me the telecom,
but he failed after exhausting my money.

42
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,211
I need to open the liquor safe,

43
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,839
but I can't reach Dongju.

44
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,800
I forgot the code for the liquor safe.

45
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,305
Then I'd have to rack my brain
for a while to recall it.

46
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,557
But I got lazy, sneaked some whiskey,

47
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,977
and ended up getting caught
by Secretary Gong.

48
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeom squeezed what he could
out of the energy deal.

49
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,655
Now he's looking for another money hole.

50
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,575
For now,
let's shove some cash down his throat.

51
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,994
We'll handle it

52
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,954
step by step.

53
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,124
Since Dongju isn't here...

54
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,087
you get the money from my private safe

55
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,049
and throw some at Yeom right now.

56
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,718
Yes, Father.

57
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,024
Here.

58
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,652
INNER SAFE

59
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,696
Take a photo.

60
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,157
- Sorry?
- Hurry and take a photo.

61
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,577
It's impossible to memorize 16 digits.

62
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,746
Oh, yes.

63
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,635
Seo Dongju!

64
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,098
Seo Dongju!

65
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,602
Hyungrae.

66
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,396
Come this way.

67
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,499
When did you get back?

68
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,545
Just a while ago.

69
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,259
Can you get me a suit?

70
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,764
You look like you haven't slept a wink.

71
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,809
I need to see Father early before work.

72
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,068
As if Ji Seonu wasn't
enough of a headache,

73
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,283
Yeom Jangseon caught Eunnam
trying to go on a trip with Dongju.

74
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,286
We have to...

75
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,914
kick Seo Dongju out.

76
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,417
If he approaches Seonu again,
it'll be trouble.

77
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,173
We can't kill him,
so we have to find another way...

78
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,520
Give him a severance package,
a settlement, whatever it takes.

79
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,647
Please...

80
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,277
Just get Seo Dongju out of Daesan.

81
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,696
If not,

82
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,907
Ji Seonu will join the family,

83
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,953
and Taeyun will be devoured by him, honey.

84
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,288
Okay?

85
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,507
Seo Dongju...

86
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,887
won't be able to do that.

87
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,600
Never.

88
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,830
Seong Hyeon!

89
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,028
You're alive.

90
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,450
But...

91
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,035
you shouldn't be moving like this yet.

92
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,120
Okay?

93
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,914
Hey...

94
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,881
I'm...

95
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,883
You're?

96
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,011
I'm hungry.

97
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,696
LIQUOR SAFE
INNER SAFE

98
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,673
Want a drink?

99
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,425
No, I'm good.

100
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,045
You remembered the liquor safe's code...

101
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,215
I racked my brain pretty hard.

102
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,851
Was Yeom happy to get the money?

103
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,562
I couldn't give him any.

104
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:01,067
- What?
- The code you gave me didn't work.

105
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,111
What?

106
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,203
Oh, that's right!

107
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,872
I forgot that I changed it.

108
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,752
I noted down the new code somewhere safe.

109
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,463
I'll find it for you.
You should head to work first.

110
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,466
Yes, I'll see you later then.

111
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,067
I have to hide it in plain sight
to keep it safe.

112
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,724
Yes, Father.

113
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>I'll give you the money
once Dongju's back from vacation.</i>

114
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,814
<i>If we keep handing it over
every time he asks,</i>

115
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,901
<i>Yeom will only get greedier.</i>

116
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,154
You should try to hold him off.

117
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,281
That takes skill too.

118
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,650
I'm sorry.

119
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,278
I have my reasons,

120
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,448
and I need to stay off the cops' radar
for the time being.

121
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,452
That's why I couldn't
take you to the hospital.

122
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,205
Thank you for staying alive.

123
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,583
I owe you one.

124
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,544
If you had died,
I wouldn't have been able to report it.

125
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,630
I would have had to just dump your body.

126
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,385
I'm Bae Wonbae.

127
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,720
Damn it.

128
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,223
Well, that's my real name.
Around here, I'm Jang Ilnam.

129
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,060
They just call me "Beardy Jang."

130
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,231
Right...

131
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,902
My name is Seong Hyeon.

132
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,988
And your last name?

133
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,492
I see. So "Seong" is your last name
and "Hyeon" is your first.

134
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,120
Just one syllable.

135
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:47,001
Hyeon, you basically
came back from the dead.

136
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,378
But...

137
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,673
how did you end up getting shot?

138
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,801
Bang, bang! You took two bullets.

139
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,345
You got shot!

140
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,764
That's why I couldn't
take you to a hospital.

141
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,934
Doctors report gunshot wounds
to the police.

142
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,730
I was actually in a car crash.

143
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,859
These bullets...

144
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,235
One came out of here

145
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,739
and the other from here.

146
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,075
Getting shot in South Korea
out of all places?

147
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,870
That's not normal. Definitely not, but...

148
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,958
I'm telling you,
these bullets are really from your body.

149
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,211
Somebody shot you to take you out.

150
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,296
Then, you tried to get away in your car.

151
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,716
But they chased you down and sent you

152
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,760
flying off a cliff.

153
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,683
But I don't remember getting shot.

154
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,362
It was over here.

155
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,075
Hey!

156
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,792
I dived to catch some octopus

157
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,877
and came up for air like this.

158
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,881
And that's when I saw you
floating on a wooden plank.

159
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,220
Over there. You must've drifted in
from somewhere out there.

160
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,605
Is there anything
you'd like for dinner?

161
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,773
I'm good.

162
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:38,320
You're good? By the way,
your recovery is something else.

163
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,030
It's raining.

164
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,199
- Will you be able to run?
- Yes.

165
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,702
Follow me.

166
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,588
HOUSE OF OVERFLOW

167
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,682
Honey, take your head tie off
before you go.

168
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,728
I need to keep it on so people know
I'm dealing with a headache

169
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,772
and that I'm not in a good mood.

170
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,532
This is cash from the inner safe, sir.

171
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,923
It's frustrating to see you,
someone I care about,

172
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,968
lugging around
something as tacky as that fruit box.

173
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,306
The cash in Chairman Cha's safe
isn't Korean won,

174
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,726
it's US dollars.

175
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,688
The same dollars that
the dead Seo Dongju used to toss around

176
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,275
in a tiny dress shirt box
like it was nothing.

177
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,903
You didn't know?

178
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:13,035
When are you going to truly be
part of Daesan's inner circle?

179
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,122
We've got a company to run
and a country to take care of,

180
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,167
yet here we are, stuck in this mess.

181
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,629
If Chairman Cha refuses
to hand over the safe code,

182
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,384
you should have the guts
to blow the damn thing open.

183
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,057
It pains me to watch you
scrounging for funds elsewhere like this.

184
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,812
Running this National Patriotism Fund
shouldn't be this messy.

185
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,231
Gosh.

186
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,358
Damn it.

187
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,656
Looks like the chairman forgot who I am.

188
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,536
Maybe I should turn Daesan upside down
to remind him.

189
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,290
Hyeon, come over here.

190
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,217
It's a women's bracelet.

191
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,553
This one's a men's watch.

192
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,180
You were wearing it.

193
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,976
Do you see that tattoo?

194
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,727
At the vine's tip,

195
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,814
there are initials, Y. E. N.

196
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,486
Do those initials remind you of anything?

197
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,408
Oh, right. Look at this.

198
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,869
You were probably...

199
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:42,040
on your way to your wedding
when it happened.

200
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,667
This looks just like a groom's suit.

201
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,753
Look.

202
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,796
You can see the holes here.

203
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,178
Oh, right. Your phone.

204
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,686
This was in your pocket.

205
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,355
I took it apart to dry out the saltwater.

206
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,108
Not sure if it'll work, though.

207
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,527
Here.

208
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,619
If you turn this on,

209
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,956
you might connect
with the ones who tried to kill you.

210
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,084
Think it through.

211
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,765
It's working!

212
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,147
Eunnam.

213
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,907
Huicheol, what are you doing here?

214
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,785
Your grandfather told him to come.

215
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,705
Talk to her
and take her home with you after dinner.

216
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,290
Okay.

217
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,840
Hey...

218
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,716
Mom.

219
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,011
Mom.

220
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,810
- You can't so suddenly...
- Father wants you

221
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,355
to give up your shares
if you don't return.

222
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,237
Hello?

223
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,616
<i>Hello?</i>

224
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,326
I'm Seong Hyeon.

225
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,161
May I ask who I'm speaking to?

226
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,954
<i>You crazy punk, seriously.</i>

227
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,916
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

228
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,918
<i>Do you want to die, you punk?</i>

229
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,753
<i>Who do you think you're calling?</i>

230
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,298
Who the hell are you?
Why are you swearing at me out of nowhere?

231
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,133
I can say whatever the hell I want.

232
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,928
What's it to you, you thug?

233
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:43,471
Hey, who are you?

234
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,097
I'm your god, loser.

235
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,599
You son of a...

236
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,935
What?

237
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:52,064
Damn, it's broken.

238
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,819
What do we do now?
I worked so hard to fix this.

239
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,741
Asking me to give back my shares is just...

240
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,118
It's cheap.

241
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,913
Eunnam.

242
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,833
Every business has its cheap side.

243
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,712
The moment you feel ashamed of it,
you've already lost.

244
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,089
You just have to admit

245
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,218
that your marriage was
a business deal between you and me.

246
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,012
No need to overthink it.
It's just business.

247
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,306
Do you understand?

248
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,560
If you give up the shares,

249
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,856
it'll prove to me
that you truly want a divorce.

250
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,816
I'll be understanding.

251
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,151
I'm your granddaughter.

252
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,489
I have the same inheritance rights
as everyone else.

253
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,661
You want both my Daesan shares

254
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,705
and Seo Dongju?

255
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,791
That's not how this works.

256
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,962
The only way you can keep those shares

257
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,049
is if you stay
as Yeom Jangseon's niece-in-law.

258
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,472
Where's my mother-in-law?

259
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,808
In the main living room.

260
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,812
Can I get some ice water?

261
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,239
I'll take Eunnam home
after seeing the chairman.

262
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,700
Not staying for dinner?

263
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,204
This is the phone

264
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,957
Eunnam used to call Seo Dongju.

265
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,668
I'll leave it to you.

266
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,717
I got a call from that crazy bastard...

267
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,970
I mean, Seo Dongju.

268
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,895
When I answered,

269
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,733
he panicked and lied,
saying that his name was Seong Hyeon.

270
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:05,321
I told him that if he was Seong Hyeon,
then I was his god.

271
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,407
We cursed each other out for a while.

272
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,291
Do you still want to take Eunnam with you
even after that call?

273
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,169
Yes.

274
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,974
Mmm.

275
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,144
Eunnam is going back home.

276
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,230
As she should.

277
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,565
Explain to them well.

278
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,651
Yes, sir.

279
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,946
It's your birthday
in two months, right?

280
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,324
I'll throw a grand feast
for your first birthday as a newlywed.

281
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,284
Be sure to come.

282
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,537
Yes, thank you.

283
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,917
Were you waiting for me?

284
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,169
Yes, sir.

285
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,973
Sir...

286
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,557
Yes?

287
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,518
I went to the secretary's office
about document revisions

288
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,769
and overheard them

289
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,189
talking to the Coast Guard
about Director Seo.

290
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,235
The Coast Guard?

291
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,903
Yes.

292
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,285
CARAMBOLA INTERNET CAFE

293
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,914
"South Coast car accident."

294
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:39,999
Hmm.

295
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,959
"Eight-car pileup, three dead."

296
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,753
I don't think that's it.

297
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,089
"Traveled to the South Coast by car."

298
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,842
"Two dead, one seriously injured."

299
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,928
"Men in their 70s and 80s."

300
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,638
None of the accidents in these articles

301
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,267
seem connected to you.

302
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,477
{\an8}"Missing, Seong Hyeon."

303
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,522
Let's see.

304
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,399
The location.

305
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,736
"Seonghyeon-ro, Sandong-gu,
Ilsan-gu, Goyang City."

306
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,821
"A parrot"?

307
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
"Unknown gender, a year old." Not this.

308
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,493
Four? Three?

309
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,874
I'm back.

310
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,542
Yes.

311
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,336
Father...

312
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,172
The Coast Guard contacted us.

313
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,382
It seems that Director Seo rented a yacht.

314
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,469
He said his dream was
to sail far out to sea on a yacht.

315
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,887
He finally did it.

316
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:39,266
But the yacht missed
its scheduled return date,

317
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,269
so the police inspected it.

318
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,356
But Director Seo wasn't on board
and they couldn't reach him,

319
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,150
so they contacted the company.

320
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,570
Then should we file
a missing person report?

321
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,990
Well, I don't think that's necessary yet.

322
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,617
Find him as soon as possible.

323
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,745
Get him back to work.

324
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,791
It's so frustrating and inconvenient
without him here.

325
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,922
Not a single article links to you.

326
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,633
Then you must be regarded
as a dangerous man

327
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,595
to get shot like that in South Korea.

328
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,891
Are you an undercover NIS agent?

329
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,352
Or a crime boss?

330
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:24,604
International mafia?

331
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,485
Anyway, are you really
not going to call the cops?

332
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,992
I feel like you're not calling them
because of me.

333
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,287
Something tells me I shouldn't

334
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,372
tell the police about this.

335
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,959
For no clear reason.
It's just a gut feeling.

336
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,919
Hang on, I got a call.

337
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,213
Oh, it's Changgyu.

338
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,716
Yes. What?

339
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,801
Wow, did you fix it already?

340
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,012
You're a total MacGyver.

341
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,346
Okay, I'll be there.

342
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,058
Your phone is fixed.
Let's hurry and check it out.

343
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,687
CELL PHONE REPAIR

344
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,860
Here.

345
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,653
- Who is he?
- My younger brother.

346
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,615
Does that make him Jang Number Two?

347
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,784
We could pass for twins,
don't you think?

348
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,910
It's working!

349
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,787
It's barely holding up.

350
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,581
If it breaks again, just toss it.

351
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,875
- Wow, thank you so much.
- Sure.

352
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,585
I owe you one. I'll get going.

353
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,671
- Okay, get home safe.
- Yes, see you.

354
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,383
Hyeon, he fixed it.

355
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,565
Call Seo Dongju and set him straight.

356
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,653
This is the phone he used
to talk to Eunnam.

357
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,748
Call him now.

358
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,249
Or I won't be able to sleep.

359
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,795
Is that what Eunnam told you?
That she talked to him with this phone?

360
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,339
Earlier today,

361
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,592
Prosecutor Yeom answered,
and it was Seo Dongju.

362
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,471
No way. It must be someone else.

363
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,142
They've known each other
since high school.

364
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,853
He recognized the voice instantly.

365
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,688
Seo Dongju realized

366
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,067
it was Prosecutor Yeom
and tried to play it off with a fake name.

367
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,747
What?

368
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
RECORD

369
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,555
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:06,683
<i>Hello?</i>

371
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,688
<i>Hey, if you called,
say something, bastard.</i>

372
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,942
<i>You shot me, didn't you?</i>

373
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,696
<i>You're the one who shot me.</i>

374
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,367
<i>It's really you, you murderer.</i>

375
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,789
<i>No matter how many times you try,
I'm not going down, you psycho.</i>

376
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,043
<i>You're alive,</i>

377
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,005
<i>Seo Dongju.</i>

378
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,424
<i>Just wait.</i>

379
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,677
<i>I'm coming to kill you, you bastard.</i>

380
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,376
What?

381
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,046
They just hung up without a word?

382
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,633
Wow...

383
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,220
You scared the hell out of me.

384
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,972
"Just wait."

385
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,018
"I'm coming to kill you, you bastard."

386
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,895
Wow!

387
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,480
That was badass.

388
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,775
It sure was, but...

389
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,777
It's also reckless.

390
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,738
I have to try something
to get my memory back.

391
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,948
Fair enough...

392
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,201
But your call history says

393
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:53,039
this is the only number you called
before you lost your memory.

394
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,377
I doubt they called
to admit they're the killer.

395
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,092
The guy who called

396
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,010
must have betrayed you.

397
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,472
Backstabbing! Betrayal!

398
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,766
They thought I was dead.

399
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,352
Now that I'm back,

400
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,272
they must be terrified.

401
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:22,610
Well, terrified? I don't think so...

402
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,780
He might come back
to finish the job, you know.

403
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,742
Let me try.

404
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,619
Who knows?

405
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,747
Maybe he'll respond differently to me.

406
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,715
What's wrong?

407
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,678
It was working!
I didn't do anything to it.

408
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,388
It was working...

409
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,681
I didn't touch anything.

410
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,683
Give it to me. What's wrong with it?

411
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,518
You're making it worse!

412
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,729
Seriously, I didn't do anything.

413
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,190
That's funny. The timing is unreal...

414
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,738
That bastard Dongju,
he's not what he seems.

415
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,364
Actually,

416
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,410
I knew he was tenacious to the core.

417
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,620
But does that mean he was lucky?

418
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,746
No, it's not his luck.

419
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,749
Heaven took pity on me

420
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,377
and had the sea spit Seo Dongju back out.

421
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,629
It's all thanks to me.

422
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,341
He survived because of my luck.

423
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:32,137
I, Yeom Jangseon, am living proof

424
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,849
that heaven loves this country.

425
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,603
You're sure of it, right?

426
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,688
Yes.

427
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,982
Seo Dongju is alive, sir.

428
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,527
Let's see...

429
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,656
Track the call location right away

430
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,616
and take President Huh with you.

431
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,786
Knock Seo Dongju out and bring him in.

432
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,621
Get the tranquilizer gun ready.

433
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,082
- And get the guys ready.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,377
Lock Seo Dongju in a room with the guys,

435
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:07,339
and in half a day,
no, actually, in 30 minutes,

436
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,425
he'll spill the Swiss account password.

437
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,635
Once I get the password,

438
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,888
I'll take care of getting rid of him.

439
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,225
You just need to bring him in.

440
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,352
Sir,

441
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,561
if he's alive,

442
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,272
why hasn't he gone to the police?

443
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,401
Because of the money.

444
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,821
If he goes to the cops,
the Swiss account gets exposed.

445
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,452
That ruthless bastard...

446
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,956
What kind of scheme is he plotting now?

447
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,821
CHEON GUHO

448
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,845
This is the closest cliff
to the coastal road.

449
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,223
If they pushed your car into the sea,

450
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,976
this is where it would've happened.

451
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,814
If a car went over the edge,

452
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,859
there should be
some marks left on the cliff.

453
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,195
But it's clean.

454
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,518
What a nice yacht.

455
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:48,620
I never thought I'd end up
living in a shack by the sea,

456
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,705
but while doing so,

457
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,083
I've learned a thing or two
about the tides.

458
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,670
If the car fell off anywhere else,

459
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,588
there's no way you could've drifted

460
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,801
all the way to the rocks
where I found you.

00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,734
It's so hot.
Looks like you're in for a tough time.

463
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,241
You hadn't been in touch,
so I wondered if you'd forgotten, sir.

464
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,242
<i>What do you mean?</i>

465
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:29,537
<i>How could I forget? I'd be damned.</i>

466
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,454
<i>I've been happy</i>

467
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,459

00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,104
<i>Bring me good news.</i>

472
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,189
Yes, sir.

473
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:04,488
There's no sign
that Seo Dongju was back on this yacht.

474
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,366
Guns are terrifying.

475
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,579
He's too scared to go back,
fearing for his life.

476
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,583
Have you seen this man before?

477
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,126
No.

478
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,087
<i>Guho will find him.</i>

479
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,964
<i>Oh, right.</i>

480
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:27,094
<i>If you do run into Seo Dongju,
make sure you play nice.</i>

481
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,012
Tell him you're sorry

482
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,890
and trying to kill him
is your biggest regret.

483
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,684
<i>That you regret shooting him.</i>

484
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,020
<i>While you keep him busy by talking to him,</i>

485
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,065
Guho will knock him out.

486
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,808
The two of them
were in the middle seat earlier.

487
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,607
Sir, have you seen him before?

He didn't move into the city

My assumption was wrong.

505

He's still at the same coastline...

506
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,640
Search thoroughly,

- Yes?

What's certain is that

537
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,951
this bearded Jang guy
treated Seo Dongju and helped him.

538
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,748
He must have gone into deep hiding
since Huh Ildo found out.

At dawn, we'll need to increase manpower
and track him down, Guho.

Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

541
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,207
Just trust me, okay?

542
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,701
<i>Yes.</i>

543
00:58:58,702 --> 00:58:59,870
Any calls...

544
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,246
from Seo Dongju?

545
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,707
No.

546
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,293
Dongju wouldn't call me.

547
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,044
Yes.

548
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,256
Okay, I'll tell him to call you
if he calls me.

549
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,636
Was that your father?

550
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,388
Yes.

551
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,224
I hope that bastard Dongju
never comes back.

552
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,351
Or, better yet, drops dead somewhere.

553
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,647
That way, you will finally let go of him
and only look at me.

554
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,530
What I miss about Seo Dongju

555
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:37,783
is the man he was.

556
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,118
Not a husband.

557
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,599
Looks good on you.

558
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,894
Don't forget
we're picking up your suit later.

559
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,052
Yes, it's our product.

560
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,347
I'll check with the master tailor
and get back to you.

561
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,436
He's coming.

562
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,694
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

563
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,532
Go ahead and start.

564
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,627
Do I pick one from here?

565
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,836
They're all gifts from Mom.

566
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,381
Exchange what you don't like.

567
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,054
Yes. S, E, O.

568
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,515
It says "Seo."

569
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,228
Yes. The initials are D. J.

570
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,314
Yes, I understand.

571
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,733
I'm sorry,

572
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,821
but we can't disclose any information
about the customer who purchased this.

573
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,158
Leave your name and number,

574
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,285
and our manager will reach out tomorrow.

575
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,455
- Your name?
- Seong Hyeon.

576
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,958
Last name Seong, first name Hyeon.

577
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,767
Dongju.

578
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:34,936
My number is 0661...

579
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,563
Dongju.

580
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,050
Buried Hearts

581
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,885
{\an8}<i>Dongju, come on in.</i>

582
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,263
{\an8}<i>I wouldn't be this happy
even if a dead son came back to life.</i>

583
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,557
{\an8}<i>You couldn't come back
because you lost your memory?</i>

584
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,434
{\an8}Are we having an affair?

585
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,687
{\an8}I'm doing this because I really need
what's in Seo Dongju's head.

586
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,482
{\an8}<i>His past memories are gone, sir.</i>

587
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:06,111
{\an8}<i>Did the president
shoot me to kill me?</i>

588
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,154
{\an8}<i>If this isn't an act,</i>

589
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:13,200
{\an8}<i>then I'll smash that amnesiac brain
of yours with a hammer if I have to</i>

590
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,702
{\an8}<i>to get my Swiss account back.</i>
