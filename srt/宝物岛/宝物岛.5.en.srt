00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,884
{\an8}<i>that you didn't go to New York
to pursue the chairman's granddaughter?</i>

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,012
{\an8}<i>To be exact,
it's because I fell for you.</i>

7
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,014
{\an8}I've told you this before.

8
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,100
{\an8}<i>About Seo Dongju.</i>

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,142
{\an8}Can you end it for good?

{\an8}<i>If he clings after learning
you're Daesan's heiress,</i>

11
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,396
{\an8}<i>it will be a problem.</i>

12
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,690

{\an8}<i>my uncle,</i>

15
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,195
{\an8}<i>is the one who arranged this.</i>

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,073
{\an8}<i>And I was going to propose
to you today. What a fool I am.</i>

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,159
{\an8}<i>I was going to ask,
but you went and married someone else.</i>

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,245
{\an8}Isn't it me who you love?

19
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,206
{\an8}Kick Seo Dongju out of Daesan.

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,499
{\an8}<i>I'm not leaving Daesan.</i>

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,709
{\an8}<i>I am worried.</i>

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,711
{\an8}<i>Having you at Daesan feels like...</i>

23
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,629
{\an8}<i>I skimmed off
some of the slush fund.</i>

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,755
{\an8}<i>Let me live,</i>

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,382
{\an8}<i>and I'll return it and disappear.</i>

{\an8}<i>Seo Dongju...</i>

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,805

locked it in his head, and ran off.</i>

28
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:42,351
{\an8}<i>And you shot and killed the man
who's worth two trillion won.</i>

29
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,020
{\an8}<i>Either cough up my two trillion won</i>

30
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,733
{\an8}or raise Seo Dongju
from the dead if you have to!

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,777
{\an8}<i>You'd better come back to life.</i>

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,029
{\an8}Come back to life!

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,322

{\an8}Yes. The initials are D. J.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,856
{\an8}Yes, I understand.

48
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,233
{\an8}I'm sorry,

49
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,446
{\an8}but we can't disclose any information
about the customer who purchased this.

50
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,075
{\an8}Leave your name and number,

00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,786
{\an8}and our manager will reach out tomorrow.

52
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,456
- Your name?
- Seong Hyeon.

53
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,793
Last name Seong, first name Hyeon.

54
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,753

Director Seo.

57
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,483
Was the bride
happy with her wedding dress?

58
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,116
Do you know me?

59
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,867
What?

60
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,704
My goodness.

61
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,664
Your suit...

62
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,916
Director Seo...

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,544
Hey, you bastard.

64
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,130
What stunt are you pulling now?

65
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,258
Looks like I found the right place.

66
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,051
What?

67
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,845
I lost my memory.

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,722
Lost your memory?

69
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,976
You've got to be kidding me.

70
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,646
You pull all kinds of crap, you thug.

71
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,704
Gosh, Prosecutor Yeom!

72
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,873
Are you okay?

73
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,418
Are you hurt?

74
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,091
Take my phone.

75
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,679
I'm bleeding like crazy here.

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,890
I'll call you.

77
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,144
Wait...

78
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,566
Tell me your name.

79
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,612
I'm Eunnam.

80
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,572

CHEON GUHO

85
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,125
- Yes, Chief Lee.
- <i>Prosecutor.</i>

86
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,169
<i>Are you sure it's Seo Dongju?</i>

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,588
Yeah, that case...
I got a look at the police report first.

88
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,674
Check it quickly.

89
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,260
Yes.

90
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:57,357
A spoonful of rice is more nourishing
than a whole bowl of porridge.

91
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,902
You should eat properly.

92
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm worried
that you've lost your appetite.

93
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:11,997
Here.

94
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,256
CHEON GUHO

95
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,384
Yes.

<i>Sir, we're closing in
on Seo Dongju.</i>

97
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,805
Again?

98
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,472
Where is he this time?

99
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,560
Prosecutor Yeom met him
at Gangnam Q Salon.

100
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,395
Okay, hold on.

101
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,036
Guho, this is the first intel we've had
on him being seen in Seoul in months.

102
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,123
That guy's always scheming,
so don't rush in.

103
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,625
Be thorough and meticulous.

104
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,210
Yes, I understand.

105
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,266
INTERNATIONAL EXPRESS

106
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,104
<i>Honey, give me real food
instead of the porridge.</i>

107
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,859
Honey, have some meat.

108
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,572
<i>Dongju, come on in.</i>

109
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,493
<i>I wouldn't be this happy
even if a dead son came back to life.</i>

110
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,498
<i>We still have very important
unfinished business between us.</i>

111
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,794
<i>The two trillion won
locked away in that head of yours.</i>

112
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,481
Turn on the hot water.

113
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,359
Cold water will make him sick.

114
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,087
I'll go check it out.

115
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,062
Director Seo.

116
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,523
Director Seo.

117
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,358
These are the extra shirts you requested,

118
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,361
saying you'd pick them up later.

119
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,282
Now that you're back from your trip,
shall I send them to your home?

120
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,117
Do you know where I live?

121
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,410
Yes, I do.

122
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,789
We've sent the suits
you tailored with Chairman Cha Gangcheon

123
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,042
to your place several times before.

124
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,419
Director Seo,

125
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,380
there's something I need to tell you.

126
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,259
Could we talk inside for a moment?

127
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,763
- Sure.
- Come this way.

128
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,987
In the cognitive function test,
the memory score was significantly lower

129
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,825
compared to concentration,
spatial awareness,

130
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,828
frontal lobe judgment,
and language abilities.

131
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,705
The most concerning part is

132
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,834
the patient's brain
is showing signs of shrinkage.

133
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,964
Is that what Chief Han thinks?

134
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,299
What does radiology say?

135
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,428
Both Neurology Chief Han
and Radiology Chief Oh

136
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,180
share the same opinion.

137
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,098
And you, Dr. Kang?

138
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,517
I agree with them.

139
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,938
In your opinion,
how long do I have

140
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,233
before my brain function
is completely shot?

141
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,951
Chairman Cha Gangcheon.

142
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,216
Dr. Kang Ihyeon.

143
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,844
I've heard that

144
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:23,348
some people with this illness
throw a tantrum right after a big meal,

145
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,350
insisting they're starving to death.

146
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,897
Father, it's not at a stage
where you need to be that concerned yet.

147
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,025
Then at what stage should I be concerned?

148
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,110
You said my brain is shrinking.

149
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,490
Every patient's prognosis varies,
so I can't say how long it will take.

150
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,911
However, your progression
is slightly faster...

151
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:44,996
Dr. Kang.

152
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,291
Than usual.

153
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,127
Slightly faster than usual...

154
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,378
Rapid progression doesn't mean

155
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,216
severe symptoms will show up immediately.

156
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,468
From now on,

157
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,263
Dr. Kang should report
my condition to me directly.

158
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,016
Tell me the hard truth, just like today.

159
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,685
Clear and precise too.

160
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,812
Yes, Chairman.

161
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,939
I understand.

162
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,316
Father, you can hear it from me.

163
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,860
- Dosu.
- Yes.

164
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,198
You might try to comfort me
with sweet lies.

165
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,200
Besides, you're a neurosurgeon,

166
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,953
not a neurologist.

167
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,955
Dosu, you are...

168
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,375
Gosh.

169
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,752
I'm starving. Let's go and eat.

170
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,296
Yes.

171
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,101
Go check.

172
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,285
Master.

173
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,954
What's the matter?

174
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,834
Well, I heard Director Seo was here,
so I came to see him.

175
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,627
I see.

176
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,882
Seo Dongju is gone.

177
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
Move quickly.

178
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,437

00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,282
Is it Huicheol's birthday today?

180
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,452
I had no idea.

181
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,455
No, I forgot.

182
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,417
I promised to throw my grandson-in-law
his first birthday party.

183
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
Even young people forget sometimes.

184
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,297
When we spoke this morning,

185
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:04,217
you said we'd go home together
in the evening and celebrate it.

186
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,635
Why are we here instead?

187
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,263
I figured that
Dr. Kang's opinion unsettled you,

188
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,767
so you must've wanted
something warm and comforting.

189
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:16,272
Have as much food as you want here,
then just pick at the party food later.

190
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,068
Today,

191
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,488
this soup is your soul food.

192
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:25,822
Soul food?

193
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,325
Yes, soul food.

194
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,417
Huicheol's birthday isn't the real issue.

195
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:38,877
I forgot something else.

196
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,214
I forgot something very important too.

197
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,423
What did you forget?

198
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,509
The code...

199
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,428
Never mind.

200
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,306
Once Dongju comes back,
that will be resolved.

201
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,725
Director Seo hasn't returned yet?

202
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,770
- How much is it?
- It's 12,000 won.

203
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,149
- Could we get more radish kimchi?
- Yes.

204
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,235
Thank you.

205
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,329
Radish kimchi.

206
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,289
Is this your new secretary, Chairman?

207
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,707
He's my son-in-law.

208
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,210
I see. Hello.

209
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,047
I thought the one you always came with

210
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,424
had been let go and replaced.

211
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,803
The one who convinced Jaepil,
my former kitchen staff,

212
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,972
to work as a chef at your place.

213
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,182
Yes, that's Director Seo.

214
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,852
He was eating over there just now.

215
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,980
He looked a bit shabby
and acted like he didn't know me.

216
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,774
I figured you must've fired him.

217
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,284
Yes, ma'am. We'll come again.

218
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,369
Father!

219
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,748
Father!

220
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,721
PROSECUTOR YEOM

221
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,186
Yes.

222
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:23,107
So, you couldn't come back
because you lost your memory?

223
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,153
If not for that Q Salon,
we might've never met again.

224
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>Probably, ma'am.</i>

225
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,241
We're on informal terms, Dongju.

226
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,785
<i>You forgot me,
and now you're speaking formally?</i>

227
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,830
Do you seriously not remember anything?

228
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,832
Are we...

229
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,920
having an affair?

230
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,048
I'll explain when we meet.

231
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,176
I'll send you an address.
Be there tonight.

232
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,512
- Where is that?
- My grandfather's place.

233
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,264
Chairman Cha of Daesan Group.

234
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,726
<i>You're Daesan Group's Executive Secretary.</i>

235
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,436
<i>Your name is</i>

236
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,272
Seo Dongju, not Seong Hyeon.

237
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,276
I thought
you were outside the treatment room.

238
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,402
I was looking for you.

239
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,947
You have to come, Dongju.

240
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,785
Were you just...

241
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,663
talking to that thug?

242
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,581
On my phone?

243
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,507
Could you be any more obvious
about Dongju?

244
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,551
If something like this happens again,

245
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,096
I'll leave Dongju
and take you to the hospital.

246
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,395
A wife taking her injured husband
to the hospital is only natural.

247
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,316
Next time, be careful
so I don't choose the other way around.

248
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,195
What...

249
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,154
Careful about what?

250
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,616
What exactly
am I supposed to be careful about?

251
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,087
<i>Chairman Cha
finally granted you a long vacation,</i>

252
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,215
<i>and you were planning
a distant trip with your bride.</i>

253
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,468
Back then, you said
the bride couldn't come here in person

254
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,596
and that she had the same measurements

255
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,224
as Yeo Eunnam from Daesan Group.

256
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,644
This woman, Yeo Eunnam, and I...

257
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,647
I can't say for certain,

258
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:32,403
but Prosecutor Yeom
seemed overly hostile toward you today.

259
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,030
So...

260
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,952
Thank you for your help.

261
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,045
By the way, is there another exit?

262
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,297
Another exit?

263
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,676
I lost my memory
after being attacked by someone,

264
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,927
so I'm trying to be careful.

265
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,472
Yes, it's this way.

266
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,903
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

267
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,255
You basically came back from the dead.

268
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,549
But...

269
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,928
how did you end up getting shot?

270
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,307
Bang, bang! You took two bullets.

271
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,608
Goodness, Father.

272
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,235
You're so fast.

273
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,657
- I'm sorry.
- You punk.

274
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,784
Where have you been?

275
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,496
Do you know me?

276
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,377
By any chance,
are you Chairman Cha Gangcheon?

277
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,963
"By any chance"?

278
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,757
What's wrong with him?

279
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,799
Um...

280
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,093
Director Seo, what's wrong?

281
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,054
Dosu, is Dongju suffering

282
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,140
from the same illness as me?

283
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,477
Let me call the car here.

284
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,229
Let's head home first
and talk about it there.

285
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,315
Sit.

286
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,275
Have a seat.

287
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,779
You punk,

288
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,781
do you know how much I...

289
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,743
You're here now.

290
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,577
You're here.

291
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,829
That's all that matters.

292
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,459
The car will be here soon.

293
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,794
Let's head home and take our time...

294
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,045
Director Seo!

295
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,130
What's going on?

296
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,384
- What?
- Please hurry.

297
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,413
Guho,

298
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,331
I was saving this wine

299
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,126
for a victory toast

300
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,045
when we catch Seo Dongju.

301
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,214
It's okay.

302
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,967
The order doesn't matter.

303
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:09,762
We'll have the victory toast first
then secure Dongju,

304
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,848
and it's over.

305
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,602
Seo Dongju didn't seem to recognize me.

306
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,692
- Where have you been?
- <i>And he looked like he'd met</i>

307
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,611
<i>Chairman Cha for the first time.</i>

308
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,738
Do you know me?

309
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,754
Give me my phone.

310
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,298
What phone?

311
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,175
Mom.

312
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,845
Hasn't it been long enough?
Get yourself together already.

313
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,807
I got married,
just as Chairman Cha wanted.

314
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,436
Whom I talk to
isn't your business anymore.

315
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,649
- Give it back now.
- Eunnam.

316
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,652
Prosecutor Yeom also knows about this.

317
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,111
- You...
- You left me in the States,

318
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
and now you're playing mom?

319
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,206
Eunnam!

320
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,255
Don't try to stop me.

321
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,134
I'll keep doing this until you admit it.

322
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,512
Like this.

323
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,973
Hey! No, stop!

324
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,813
I heard you the day Dad had his accident.

325
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,108
You were whispering to Secretary Gong.

326
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,736
That Huh Ildo killed Dad!

327
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,199
Eunnam.

328
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,701
No!

329
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,704
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're mistaken!

330
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,581
You sent me away to the States
because I remembered!

331
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,918
You wouldn't even
let me come home on breaks!

332
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,967
Your dad has your phone.

333
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,513
Even though you married him
for the Daesan shares,

334
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,016
a marriage is still a marriage.

335
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,102
Don't forget that
Prosecutor Yeom is your husband now.

336
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,357
But I guess you've forgotten that my dad,
Yeo Sunho, was once your husband.

337
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,984
What?

338
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,236
I'm not like you.

339
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:33,532
No matter how much I love Dongju,
I'm not going to kill Huicheol.

340
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,660
What are you saying?

341
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,164
You know exactly what I'm saying.

342
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,528
Dongju is back.

343
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,201
Where is he?

344
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:21,205
Before I tell you,
give me back my phone first.

345
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,843
Did he call you?

346
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,888
I met him.

347
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,569
I was trying to keep Eunnam safe.

348
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,989
I mean, I was making sure
to escort her properly.

349
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,825
Have you been there?

350
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,785
The floor is ridiculously slippery.

351
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:04,331
My foot slipped a little,
and bam, right into the table corner.

352
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,166
It doesn't hurt much. I'm okay.

353
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,878
Good thing it wasn't worse.

354
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,089
Consider it bad luck dealt with.

355
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,673
Yes.

356
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,966
Is the guest room ready?

357
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,760
Yes, it's ready.

358
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,720
It'll take a while
to set up the birthday table.

359
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,098
Get some rest.
It'll help your wound heal too.

360
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,350
Yes, Mother.

361
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,062
You're here. Gosh.

362
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,938
I fell.

363
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,148
Because the floor was slippery.

364
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,651
It's nothing. Just bad luck dealt with.

365
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,529
Funny how he always
gets bad luck on big days.

366
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,991
Remember his wedding day?
His swollen black eye...

367
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,578
Yes, that's right.

368
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,913
How could you
say that to his face?

369
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,374
Just get the rice cakes.

370
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,459
Prosecutor Yeom.

371
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,628
My goodness!

372
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,674
Deokhui, did Eunnam hit him again?

373
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,675
Uh...

374
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,845
He got hurt while escorting Eunnam.

375
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,264
- Yes.
- I see.

376
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,435
Father, you're here early.

377
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,936
What?

378
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,942
Honey, how did you
end up coming with Father?

379
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,611
Well...

380
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,489
We met to discuss
Daesan Hospital's management.

381
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,824
Welcome, Dr. Kim.

382
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,910
Hello.

383
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,202
What happened to your face?

384
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,787
He was with Eunnam...

385
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,791
Did you come to tell on Eunnam
for hitting you?

386
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,712
A prosecutor has nothing better to do?

387
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,798
Can't even handle your own household?

388
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,507
Get out.

389
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,092
No, it's not like that...

390
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,888
Don't serve him dinner.
Tell him to go eat at home.

391
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,182
Always running to his in-laws.

392
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,726
Father, you got it wrong.

393
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,645
Yeah, right.

394
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,816
It's his birthday.

395
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,697
Father must be so tired today.

396
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,659
He briefly forgot
Prosecutor Yeom's birthday.

397
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,952
We all have those days.

398
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,162
Why would I forget?

399
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,747
I was joking.

400
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,874
What?

401
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,419
Father, what kind of joke is that?

402
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,551
Gosh, my father-in-law
is such a bad joker. Right, honey?

403
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,179
No, he's too good at it.

404
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,015
He had all of us fooled.

405
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,643
That's true.

406
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,445
I thought I'd die without seeing you.

407
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,822
I'll call you.

408
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,199
Wait...

409
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,245
Tell me...

410
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,830
your name.

411
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,044
<i>You're saying
Seo Dongju didn't recognize</i>

412
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,713
Eunnam or Prosecutor Yeom.

413
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,631
Is that right, Ildo?

414
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,757
Yes, sir.

415
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,719
<i>Where is Seo Dongju now?</i>

416
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,387
Eunnam gave him our address

417
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,514
and told him to come find his memories.

418
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:13,353
The truth is, Cheon Guho chased Seo Dongju
but lost him earlier today.

419
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,815
Why didn't you tell me, sir?

420
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm telling you now,

421
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:21,987
Ildo.

422
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,449
<i>Apparently,
Chairman Cha suddenly showed up,</i>

423
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,243
<i>and Seo Dongju didn't recognize him
and ran off.</i>

424
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,622
You need to be extra careful.

425
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,294
<i>That sneaky bastard Dongju
could just be faking the memory loss.</i>

426
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,673
<i>Or worse, what if his memory
suddenly comes back and he attacks you?</i>

427
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,387
After all, you're the one...

428
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,765
who shot him.

429
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,544
HUH ILDO PROFILE

430
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,048
HUH ILDO DAESAN ENERGY PRESIDENT

431
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,272
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

432
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,233
Well...

433
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,944
I need to ask you something.

434
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,616
Did we plan a trip together,

435
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,952
and did you not show up?

436
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,329
Come to my grandfather's house.

437
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,123
I'll explain everything.

438
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,670
I ran into Chairman Cha earlier,

439
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,463
but I ran away.

440
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,506
Why did you do that?

441
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,260
You're Grandfather's favorite person.

442
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,637
I can't trust anyone.

443
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,057
<i>Especially Huh Ildo,</i>

444
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,685
<i>the president of Daesan Energy.</i>

445
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,028
I've been suspicious of him too.

446
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,533
<i>I even had this ridiculous thought
that maybe he killed you.</i>

447
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,004
<i>But that's not true.</i>

448
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,255
<i>President Huh Ildo</i>

449
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,300
<i>called me every day,
asking if you'd contacted me.</i>

450
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,470
He was desperate for you to come back.

451
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,782
<i>A guy hoping for the return
of someone he killed?</i>

452
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,408
<i>That's a joke.</i>

453
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,077
Dongju.

454
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,415
Grandfather, Dongju is...

455
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,917
I mean, Director Seo is here.

456
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,974
Hello, my name is Seong Hyeon.

457
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,725
I apologize...

458
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,394
for running away earlier.

459
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,484
Chairman Cha
was desperately waiting for you.

460
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,527
What took you so long?

461
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,030
You're here now. It's all good.

462
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,700
Arriving on a day of celebration
makes it even better.

463
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,328
Director Seo has a knack
for good timing.

464
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,537
Come on.

465
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,623
Have a seat.

466
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,228
Why did you say you were Seong Hyeon
when your name is Seo Dongju?

467
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,189
Secretary Gong?

468
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,611
I had an accident.

469
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,737
Seong Hyeon was the only name

470
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,740
I remembered when I woke up.

471
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,826
Director Seo!

472
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,411
Are you saying

473
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,831
you lost your memories?

474
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,628
Secretary Gong!

475
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,769
- Are you okay?
- Ms. Kaesong!

476
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,981
I dropped it.

477
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,775
Secretary Gong
never makes mistakes like this.

478
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,528
She's getting older.

479
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,822
- Set the table again.
- Yes, Chairman.

480
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,906
Hurry.

481
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,993
I apologize. Excuse me for a moment.

482
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,625
Something is seriously off
with Secretary Gong today.

483
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,838
If it gets worse,
send her to the hospital.

484
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,842
Ildo, Dosu, and Director Seo,
come with me.

485
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,136
Yes, Father.

486
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,431
Director Seo?

487
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,059
Chairman is calling you.

488
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,605
Right, yes.

489
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,530
Deokhui, he must've
really lost his memory.

490
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,116
He didn't even react to his name.

491
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,893
I'm glad to see you're well.

492
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,149
I worried for your life

493
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,945
when I saved you from the sea.

494
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,533
Don't worry. I'll keep that to myself.

495
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,161
When you saw me earlier
and acted like nothing happened,

496
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,957
I figured you had your reasons,
so I played along.

497
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,167
Oh.

498
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,880
I had no idea the man I saved
was my company's CEO,

499
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,132
so I avoided you.

500
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:04,926
By the way,

501
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,387
I'm sure you recognized me, so why...

502
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,139
Ildo.

503
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,933
Yes.

504
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,517
Director Seo.

505
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,602
Yes.

506
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,115
<i>Sometimes,
pieces of lost memories come back to me,</i>

507
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,868
like scattered fragments.

508
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,829
What kind of memories?

509
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,582
Just ordinary things.

510
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,917
Nothing significant.

511
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,170
What's the most recent one?

512
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,299
Earlier, before I stepped inside,

513
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,468
I looked up at the second floor.

514
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,722
And it felt oddly familiar.

515
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,057
I thought I'd been

516
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,350
here before.

517
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,436
Okay.

518
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,478
That's good.

519
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:03,484
That means it's not a complete blackout.
There's still something there. Right?

520
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,195
Yes, thankfully...

521
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,280
- Dosu.
- Yes.

522
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,075
Get Director Seo hospitalized
and tested immediately.

523
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,910
Especially the brain.

524
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,078
Make sure to get a clear scan of it.
Got it?

525
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,247
Yes, understood.

526
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,499
Father.

527
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,085
Rather than a hospital,

528
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,963
it's better for him to stay
somewhere more comfortable for now.

529
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,257
I'll get tested.

530
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,343
Okay.

531
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,514
No, it's this way.

532
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,350
Right. Okay.

533
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,321
It would've been easier to grab Dongju

534
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,658
if he had gone home
instead of the hospital.

535
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,619
Did you notice anything that proves
he's faking his memory loss?

536
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,914
It doesn't seem like an act, sir.

537
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,541
Get it together, Ildo.

538
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,503
<i>If Dongju isn't faking it</i>

539
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,421
<i>and his memory loss is real,</i>

540
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,425
the National Patriotism Fund
is gone for good.

541
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:14,179
We must extract the Swiss account password
from his head

542
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,514
by any means necessary.

543
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:19,435
When Dongju saved me from drowning,
he had no idea...

544
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,980
who I was.

545
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,066
<i>If he had recognized me,
he never would've saved my life.</i>

546
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,318
<i>His memories</i>

547
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,154
were already erased by then, sir.

548
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,587
<i>I had an accident.</i>

549
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,257
Seong Hyeon was the only name

550
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,592
I remembered when I woke up.

551
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,651
Let me know if it's too cold.

552
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,369
Hearing "Seong Hyeon"
caught you off guard, didn't it?

553
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,122
I'm just getting old.

554
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,251
I feel lightheaded sometimes,
and my grip is getting weaker.

555
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,006
Plenty of people are named Seong Hyeon.

556
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,762
That's right.

557
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,722
Besides, that child...

558
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,725
is dead.

559
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,394
Dr. Kang, I couldn't sleep

560
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,439
wondering about
Director Seo's test results.

561
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,318
Last night's test

562
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,864
showed no abnormalities.

563
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,661
We'll continue monitoring him
and run a few more tests.

564
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,667
<i>Dongju,</i>

565
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,754
<i>whether you're suffering from amnesia
or lying at the bottom of the South Sea,</i>

566
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,091
<i>it makes no difference to me.</i>

567
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,804
<i>Drop the amnesia act
while I'm telling you nicely.</i>

568
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,473
<i>If this isn't an act,</i>

569
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,768
<i>then I'll smash that amnesiac brain
of yours with a hammer if I have to</i>

570
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,271
<i>to get my Swiss account back.</i>

571
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,281
Are you awake?

572
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,911
Do you recognize me?

573
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,083
Who are you?

574
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,841
Director Seo,

575
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,802
I'm Yeom Jangseon.

576
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,389
You used to call me Mr. Yeom.

577
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,518
Yeom Jangseon...

578
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,398
What kind of absurd twist is this?

579
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,193
Director Seo loses his memory?

580
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,405
Chief.

581
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,616
Hey.

582
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,995
What brings you here so early?

583
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:49,955
Chairman,

584
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:54,751
you and I have had so many open
and deep discussions about Director Seo,

585
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,797
this talented and promising young man.

586
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,509
It's quite disheartening
to hear you ask why I'm here.

587
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,760
I came at this early hour

588
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,763
because I was worried
about Director Seo too.

589
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,810
You must be his attending doctor.
I'm Yeom Jangseon.

590
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,812
I have some information that could help...

591
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,065
Director Seo
is under restricted visitation.

592
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,192
Both of you...

593
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,738
please leave.

594
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,656
Since when?

595
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,159
As of this moment.

596
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,664
You'll recover soon,
so don't worry.

597
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,416
Yes, Chairman.

598
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,794
Chief, let's head out together.

599
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,588
Yes, let's do that, Chairman.

600
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,758
Doctor,

601
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,681
what if Director Seo
has unresolved trauma...

602
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,603
and is faking this memory loss?

603
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,107
What I mean is, it might be...

604
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,861
all just a show.

605
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,822
Please keep that in mind.

606
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,718
We'll be running a few more tests
over the next three to four days.

607
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,511
Thank you.

608
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,099
For the restricted visitation.

609
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,811
You have a brainwave test scheduled today,

610
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:41,067
so avoid any strenuous activity
and try to eat lighter than usual.

611
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:46,113
You mentioned last night
when you were brought to the ER

612
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,782
that you lost consciousness
for unknown reasons,

613
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,659
and you couldn't remember anything
when you woke up.

614
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,954
Are you still unsure about what caused

615
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,039
your unconsciousness?

616
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,043
Or did you recall
any new memories overnight?

617
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,047
No.

618
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,384
A psychiatric consultation is necessary.

619
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,636
After the psych evaluation and review,

620
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,262
you'll continue counseling...

621
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,473
The psych evaluation...

622
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,268
Do I need it
because of what Mr. Yeom just said?

623
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,854
My unresolved trauma?

624
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:21,399
Yes.

625
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:27,487
But not because he suggested it.

626
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,740
It was already planned.

627
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,119
Your memory loss

628
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,496
could be your brain's way

629
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,083
of shutting out past trauma.

630
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:45,172
If you're faking your memory loss
for some reason,

631
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,093
you need psychiatric help even more.

632
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,276
So? Does it work?

633
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,280
Yes, sir. I've been listening
to the hospital room feed.

634
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,377
Turn it up.

635
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,506
<i>The psych evaluation...</i>

636
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,135
<i>Do I need it
because of what Mr. Yeom just said?</i>

637
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:33,554
<i>My unresolved trauma?</i>

638
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,289
<i>Did you ever, even for a second,
consider marrying me?</i>

639
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,208
I didn't.

640
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,172
And I was going to propose to you today.
What a fool I am.

641
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,051
I was going to ask,
but you went and married someone else.

642
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,284
Sir, can you help me out with this?

643
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,721
His trip was taking too long.

644
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,474
But I kept telling myself
no news is good news,

645
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:46,352
that he was taking
a well-deserved rest.

646
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,524
I'm sorry for bringing bad news
on the first time we're meeting.

647
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:52,900
But I came

648
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,946
because I thought seeing you
might help Dongju regain his memory.

649
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,324
Dongju...

650
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,244
lost his memory once before.

651
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,538
When he was very little.

652
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:06,914
Back then too,

653
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:10,711
the only thing he remembered
was his own name.

654
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,840
He doesn't even
remember his name this time.

655
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,676
He insists his name is Seong Hyeon,

656
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,596
some random name that makes no sense.

657
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,849
Listen.

658
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,686
Please wait here.
I'll go get ready and come back.

659
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,532
Grandfather.

660
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,910
I understand.

661
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,496
Okay, bring her over.

662
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,040
I'll let the attending doctor know.

663
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,708
Okay.

664
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:59,050
You remember the nun
who practically raised Dongju as a child?

665
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,135
Sister Agnes.

666
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:01,886
She says

667
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,723
Dongju lost his memory
once before as a child.

668
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,017
That boy acts tough,

669
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,521
but he's not as strong
as he pretends to be.

670
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:15,275
How will he live properly if he keeps
erasing the past every time he's shaken?

671
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:17,653
Pathetic.

672
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,072
Father,

673
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:24,201
if Director Seo never regains his memory,

674
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,163
how are you going to open the safe?

675
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,000
You...

676
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,713
You knew I lost the slip with the code?

677
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,089
Yes.

678
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,549
Since when?

679
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,386
When you started pulling funds
from other sources.

680
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,596
That's when I knew.

681
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,564
That safe isn't some hunk of metal you can
burn through with some welding torch.

682
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,400
You'd have to blow it open
with enough explosives.

683
00:53:57,401 --> 00:54:00,154
If we do,
this whole building goes with it.

684
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,500
<i>It's urgent. Let's meet.</i>

685
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,969
Has Mr. Seo's pre-evaluation form come in?

686
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,850
What about the brainwave test?

687
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,561
They haven't come to take the patient yet.

688
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:34,646
Okay.

689
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,356
Thank you.

690
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,219
This is your pre-evaluation questionnaire.

691
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,304
I see.

692
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,642
PRE-EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE

693
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,019
Mr. Seo.

694
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,395
Yes.

695
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,982
When did you get
the scar on your shoulder?

696
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,906
I don't remember.

697
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,745
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes?

698
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,749
You're scheduled for a brainwave test.

699
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,585
We'll move you in the bed.

700
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:22,838
Yes, Chairman.

701
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,175
Everything is proceeding as scheduled.

702
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,762
Yes.

703
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,143
Oh, Mr. Seo's older sister?

704
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,312
Find out exactly what Sister Agnes knows

705
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,316
about Director Seo's
childhood memory loss.

706
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,901
Thanks.

707
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,506
<i>The new codes
for the liquor and money safes.</i>

708
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,556
Someday, Ji Seonu must become Cha Seonu.

709
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,391
Do you understand?

710
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,263
Excuse me!
Are you here for Patient Seo Dongju?

711
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,682
Yes.

712
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,476
What test is this for?

713
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:03,939
The brainwave test.

714
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,566
He was just taken for that.

715
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,110
By whom?

716
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,468
Hey.

717
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,221
Who on earth are you?

718
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,295
Sister Agnes.

719
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:22,726
<i>Seo Dongju.</i>

{\an8}<i>Please, help me find Dongju.</i>

730
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,605
{\an8}<i>We should report this
to the prosecution</i>

731
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,275
{\an8}<i>and let law enforcement handle it.</i>

732

I won't let it slide.

01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,707
{\an8}Give me half of it, sir.

737
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,167
{\an8}A similar shock

{\an8}<i>A stronger shock
