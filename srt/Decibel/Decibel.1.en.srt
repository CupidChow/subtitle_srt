4
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,550
<i>the typhoon is getting bigger</i>

5
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>The typhoon is expected
to cause very large waves</i>

6
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,180
<i>while crossing the sea tonight.</i>

THE WIDE OCEAN UNDER THE WATER

12
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,580
THE HALLA SHIP ON THE WAY HOME
FOLLOWING RIM OF THE PACIFIC TRAINING

13
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,590
Jeon Tae Ryeong.

14
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,320
Don't take anything fragile
like a crystal ball with you.

15
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,100
It can be destroyed instantly

16
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,650
Hasn't your brother taught you?

17
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,260
Sorry.

18
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,840
By the way, both of
you are very handsome

19
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,010
Besides that.

20
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,890
I heard the captain got promoted
thanks to the vice captain.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,610
The captain seems angry

22
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,360
Because the representative is right, not the captain.

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,970
That's why he was angry.

24
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,560
His expression was cold

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,160
I think he's about to lose control

26
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
But maybe not.

27
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,750
He is merciless

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,860
When it starts fighting.

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,720
Right.

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,150
His face is too handsome

31
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,110
and studied abroad.

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
I don't think he even knew
how much the bus fare was.

33
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,280
Sometimes, to be honest,

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,430
35
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
I feel like her brother.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,840
If you look closely,

36
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,820
her eyes shine like
my dog ​​Bobby, bobby...

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,100
I miss her.

38
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,130
Really

39
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,930
Hey

40
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,320
I dreamed someone was calling my name.

41
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,790
Respect!

42
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,900
Forget it!

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,100
But... this dream...

44
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,830
It seems real.

45
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,470
- Do I look like Bobby?
- What?

46
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,430
Oh, no, sir!

47
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,670
No, no.. Sir!

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,040
Am I your sister?

49
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,200
Sorry

50
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,100
What's this

51
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,860
Very cool

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,110
I'll play it and
return it later.

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,710
But...

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
What are you guys going to do?

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
I'm a very vengeful person.

56
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,900
How dare you talk about me behind my back?

57
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,640
- I...
- Hey.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
Good grief

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,070
I'm hungry. Prepare ramyeon!

60
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,900
Yes.

61
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,990
What is it?

62
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,270
I don't really know.

63
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,810
Looks like something to report.

64
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,460
Really?

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,570
Congratulations on your promotion!

66
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,280
Congratulations on your promotion!

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,530
Congratulations on your promotion!

68
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,420
- Congratulations on your promotion!
- Happy!

69
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,280
Respect!

70
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,320
Good grief

71
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,700
Failed, right?

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,010
Hey, you guys are not good
at reading the situation?  See!

73
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,800
Whose idea is this?

74
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,260
Think about it if you
were in his position

75
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,500
For doing it

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,200
How did the captain
feel when he saw this,

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,880
Seeing you all so happy?

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,990
I don't understand this awkward situation

79
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,920
Lieutenant Kwong.

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,910
Right

81
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,320
I told you not to do it!

82
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,560
But Chief NCO No
insists on doing so.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,530
What?  No.

84
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,740
I told you no.

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,430
Why are we doing all this?
Irritating.

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,860
Very nice

87
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,910
- Everyone agrees
- What's so good about it?

88
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,060
Look at the atmosphere.

89
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,790
All dispersed, dispersed!

90
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,560
disperse!

91
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,190
Come on!

92
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,870
These are all your orders, sir!

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,410
- I?
- Yes.

94
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,310
Really?

95
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,380
But you did it, how about it?

96
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,830
I fainted

97
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,260
Is your heart made of stone?

98
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,780
Whatever, if you feel at a loss
you can be his representative

99
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,330
What's that?

100
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,430
Present?

101
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,560
Yes.

102
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,060
Commemorating
RIMPAC (Rim of the pacific)

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,940
Jeon Tae Ryeong.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,020
Did your girlfriend knit this for you?

105
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,320
It's different from the one I bought.

106
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,600
The texture is different.

107
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,870
I bought it.

108
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,200
Really?

109
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,190
I'll take it too.

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,240
Fiery red!

111
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,450
Thank you.

112
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,010
Where are you going?

113
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,000
Come here!
You have a chance to take a photo with me.

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,640
Come on

115
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
The Vice Captain is waiting for everyone.

116
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,350
Taking pictures.

117
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,160
Lower your cell phones!

118
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,520
Shut up.

119
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Who's that?  There's a message from headquarters.

120
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
Guess who?

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Where's Lieutenant Kwong?

122
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,600
Here!

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960

We,

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,440
do not give up.

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,480
Because we believe in being saved.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
So no one gives up.

154
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,410
The crew is said to have died in the stern

155
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,530
The moment the control room wall collapsed.

156
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,340
Why did the dead go into the stern?

157
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,340
Now wasn't the time
to ask that question.

158
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,350
If you are curious, see the previous news.

159
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,530
Let me ask a question.

160
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,410
All crew members agree that they would not
have survived without Commander Kang Do-young.

161
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,820
What kind of leadership
do you show to the crew

162
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,700
As long as vice captain?

163
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,600
Commander.

164
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,730
Who are you?

165
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,670
I heard you got into trouble
with the chairman a few days ago.

166
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,530
What are you doing?

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,650
The chairman doesn't like going to the hospital.

168
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
But you forced it?

171
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,760
but it doesn't look good to the outside world.

172
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,970
It will also attract press attention.

173
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,950
Do not mind me.

174
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,610
I'm not a soldier anymore.

175
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,110
Don't ever follow me or the crew again.

176
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,540
Don't be a coward like most people

177
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,480
simply because they are
constantly appearing before our eyes

178
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,130

came back alive in one piece

You haven't been home lately?

195

I'm happy to be here.

They all look like my family

197
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,730
The place is indeed cramped.

198
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,350
Some people like to drink here.

199
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,550
Some came then went mad.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,780

Almost here every day

205
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,590
Poor kid.

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,490
Thank you.

Say.

210
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,190
Ah right.

211
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,500
That...

212
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,300
I'm forbidden from talking about it.

213
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,830
What is it, say!

214
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,620

Always talking about something weird.

217
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,030
Something inappropriate.

218
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,350
I told him not to do it

219
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,380
He just laughed and ignored my words.

220
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,200
He didn't hear me at all.

228
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,780
Not him.

229
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,250
I saw him yesterday.

230
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,070
Wake up!

One minute before the shot

313

The submarine lost speed.

314
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,750

to do with me watching the game?

375
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,900
Aren't you reporters?

376
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,520
Looks like a terrorist attack.

377
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,740
Where?

378
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,520
Hall ship.

379
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,820
Who's in Halla?

380
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,260
Do you know if I say?

381
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,200
Possible.

382
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,190
- Come home!
- Don't want to!

383
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,980
Honey, you want me to punch you?

384
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,170
Of course not.

385
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,750
Let's wrap it up!

386
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,050
It's cracked!

387
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,830
Wait! Wait!

388
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,780
<i>You do realize this is live!</i>

389
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,160
<i>It exploded as soon as it got a response.</i>

390
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,630
I'm in row 11, seat 9.

391
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,530
<i>It's no ordinary bomb.</i>

392
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,750
<i>It's a bomb that responds to sound.</i>

393
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,200
<i>You saw the VIP seats.</i>

394
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,820
<i>Anything above 100
decibels will speed up the time.</i>

395
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,650
<i>It'd be fun if it exploded, it's fun!</i>

396
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,840
Uncle marine, because of you...

397
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,330
Where's the bomb?

398
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,320
Bomb.

399
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,210
<i>It's a bomb you can't stop.</i>

400
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,140
<i>You can't move one bit</i>

401
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,610
VICE CAPTAIN KANG DO-YOUNG FROM HALLA

402
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,140
Ship Halla Kang Do-young.

403
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,920
Commander Kang, right?

404
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,270
I heard you say bomb.

405
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,530
I'm taking my son with me now.

406
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,540
There's a bomb in the stadium.

407
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,130
Should we evacuate everyone?

408
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,430
Will explode before
anyone can get out.

409
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,140
The bomb will explode
if it makes noise

410
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,290
How could it be in such a quiet arena?

411
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,120
Divert their attention!

412
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,040
I?

413
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,600
How?

414
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,290
It's Kang Jae Wook.  Kang Jae Wook!

415
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,720
<i>He's making progress</i>

416
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,620
<i>Ha Jae-young is really handsome.</i>

417
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,740
Are you guys back?

418
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,020
We're still at the stadium.

419
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,860
Ask your dad to answer.

420
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,640
He went to buy hot dogs.

421
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,380
Trouble maker

422
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,030
<i>Round to determine the point
penalty for the Busan team.</i>

423
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,360
<i>What's that?</i>

424
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,590
<i>Strange man enters the field</i>

425
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,470
What's that?

426
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,520
Has he gone mad?

427
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,180
<i>Not a spectator, but an attention seeker, right?</i>

428
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,350
<i>He even kicks a ball.
What is he doing?</i>

429
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,860
His wife must be miserable

430
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,390
How could he act like your father?

431
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,160
<i>He covered his face,
but I couldn't see him.</i>

432
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,350
Too attention seeking.

433
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,690
- Very embarrassing.
- What happened on the field?

434
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,310
<i>I hope they get him
out of there soon.</i>

435
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,410
This is crazy.

436
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,620
It's Dad!

437
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,470
<i>We have to get him out of there.</i>

438
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,990
<i>Such a person deserves severe punishment.</i>

439
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,780
That's brother-in-law.

440
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,850
Embarrassing.

441
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,240
No, not him.

442
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,580
It was him

443
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,540
No

444
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,500
You can't confirm it

445
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,830
What happened.

446
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,450
Hey Kang Do-young, hey!

447
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,890
You scared me

448
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,660
What happened?

449
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,440
Sorry there's a bomb.

450
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,500
Commander Kang.

451
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,830
What is it?

452
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,020
What do you mean, bomb?

453
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,520
What are you doing here now?

454
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,670
Sorry.

455
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,950
Kang Do-young, what's wrong with you?

456
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,810
It is nothing.

457
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,460
Don't be too serious,
please watch the football.

458
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,920
Kang, did you hear anything?

459
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,020
It's a real bomb!

460
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,800
Get out, get out!

461
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,200
My son is missing

462
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,690
Please help me find it

463
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,310
Young-woo, come out!

464
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,440
Find my son!

465
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,340
Mother

466
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,750
Byung-woof.

467
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,810
Stay there, Understood!

468
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,800
Young-woo, Young-woo.

469
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,100
- Mother
- It's okay.

470
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,430
You are okay?

471
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,640
So much blood

472
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,900
<i>You're brilliant.</i>

473
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,400
<i>Do you have to save people?</i>

474
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,720
What do you want?

475
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,430
<i>The third bomb will be launched,</i>

476
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,910
<i>at the Cheolsan Apartment Amusement Park.</i>

477
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,860
<i>Jang Yeo-jeong was also there</i>

478
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,750
<i>Chances are you'll
need to tame it yourself.</i>

479
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,030
<i>Looks like it can be tamed.</i>

480
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,130
<i>The fourth bomb, Natatorium Anjae</i>

481
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,890
<i>It's a very busy day.</i>

482
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,880
<i>If the pool is noisy, it will explode.</i>

483
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,140
<i>Where are you going?</i>

484
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,720
<i>If you don't make a choice, both</i>

485
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,850
<i>Don't close it
before I blow it up.</i>

486
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,050
<i>So take your pick!</i>

487
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,520
<i>Swimming pool?  Amusement parks?</i>

488
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,060
I'm going to the pool.

489
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,920
<i>Jang Yeo-jeong will die.</i>

490
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,110
Listen to me,

491
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,380
You will also die if anything
happens to Jang Yeo-jeong.

492
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,000
<i>Hurry up, if it's too late,
the Pool will also explode</i>

493
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,880
What happened?

494
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,510
Can I ask a question?

495
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,570
Yellow duck...Water park?

496
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,180
But I can't swim...

497
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,390
Why don't you ask
them to step aside?

498
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,370
What are you waiting for?
Sound the horn!

499
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,660
What happened?

500
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,580
Where's that?

501
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,890
This amusement park!

502
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,150
Chief of Staff, you want me to go?

503
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,580
No time, I'll go alone.

504
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,620
Uncle, your hands are bleeding.

505
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,330
What's your name?

506
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,790
Oh Byung-guk.

507
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,710
Thank you, Byung-guk.

508
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,980
Mom bought it to wipe my nose.

509
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,060
I've never used it though.

510
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,620
Thank you.

511
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,750
You look as energetic as your father,

512
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,840
Although his mother gave
birth to him, but he looks like me.

513
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,570
Byung-guk, can you come in by yourself?

514
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,920
Dad, you're famous on youtube.

515
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,860
Is it me?

516
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,730
What are you doing?

517
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,910
- I'd like to borrow your car.
- What?

518
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,820
What do you mean?
This car is not fully paid off.

519
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,710
I will pay you

520
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,940
Not about that!

521
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,340
You're so generous!

522
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,890
Just take good care of my car.

523
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,270
Who am I?

524
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,220
I have a reason for that!

525
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,150
<i>What are you showing off your belly for?</i>

526
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,440
Am I crazy?

527
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,650
I told you there's a reason
to show my belly there.

528
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>You want to be in the news, right?</i>

529
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,630
I'm in a bit of a rush.
Please call my wife.

530
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,330
Reply me!

531
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,770
I have to call the wife..
It's been a while!

532
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,620
<i>What wife?</i>

533
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,040
- Not you, another wife.
-<i> Are you crazy?</i>

534
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,960
I'll call the other
wife, I'll call you back.

535
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,800
Say what?

536
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,350
Make a call for me.

537
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,530
Someone can hear me.
So I can't use my phone

538
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,350
He can hack your phone,
then that's really something.

539
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,520
<i>The number you have dialed cannot be reached.</i>

540
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,240
Let's just say, basically what I said...

541
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,630
Anyway, tell me what
happened, so I can help you.

542
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,880
A bomb exploded in front of me.

543
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,330
I can't just lend my car!

544
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,530
How about you get off now?

545
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,060
Don't want to

546
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,640
Commander,

547
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,840
Do you really like to rule?

548
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,480
Yes, I like to rule!

549
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,480
You know how humiliated I was in the field?

550
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,880
It's the digital age!
It will stay on YouTube forever!

551
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,070
I bared my belly in front of my son
and his father was dragged outside.

552
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,360
Hold on tight!

553
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,130
Hold... hold what?

554
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,950
I haven't got it yet!

555
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,330
Car!  Car!

556
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,410
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

557
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,590
We need the police.

558
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,230
<i>No, not the police.</i>

559
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,240
<i>This is our business.</i>

560
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,450
There were two explosions,
both related to Kang Do-young.

561
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,840
I've sent you a photo.

562
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,850
Suspect of terrorist attack.
Look!

563
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,950
Something's wrong

564
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,540
Call the police department,
search through the CCTV.

565
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,130
We have to find Kang Do-young.

566
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,050
Yes, Sir!

567
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,270
Which station do you work at?

568
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,290
What?  What are you talking about?

569
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,650
You're a journalist from CBC?

570
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,290
I said no!

571
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,980
OH BI-OH

572
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,040
That's right, I'm a journalist.

573
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,050
I'll tell you about that later.

574
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,130
I'm not doing this for the headlines.
Wait a moment.

575
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,580
Hi darling.

576
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,310
I understand.

577
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,190
My wife says she won't tell you

578
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,080
It's a coincidence, right?

579
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,870
There are so many people on the EOD Team,

580
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,690
There must be someone you can think of.

581
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,170
Commander, say something.

582
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,480
So I can know how to help you!

583
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,420
This isn't something you can handle alone.

584
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,520
So tell me.

585
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,980
Turn off the recording first!

586
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,820
What?

587
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,170
How... how did this happen?

588
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,710
It's dead, tell me now!

589
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,960
- Turn off.
- Yes

590
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,630
Red light.

591
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,350
Red light!  Red light!

592
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,310
What?

593
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,220
Police?

594
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,310
Yes, I'm from the Busan Police Department.

595
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,790
Don't do anything,
just wait there.

596
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,250
Don't do anything.

597
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,250
Extend your rest!
Don't attract attention!

598
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,420
<i>You must tell the reason</i>

599
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,500
I'm almost there

600
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,550
What?  What's that?

601
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,770
The police called.

602
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,480
Police?

603
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,300
He said we should
extend the break.

604
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,970
Why?

605
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,600
Section Chief,

606
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,280
Commander Kang's wife is
Chief Petty Officer Jang Yeo-jeong.

607
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,870
WARNING!  LEVEL 1 CONFIDENTIAL: NO
ACCESS OTHER THAN RELATED PARTIES

608
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,760
I need the password to confirm it.

609
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,370
<i>OK, I'll send it to you
right away.  Just confirm.</i>

610
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,080
But now Chief Petty Officer Jang
Yeo-jeong is defusing a bomb in the park.

611
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,450
Mong-lyuk.

612
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:11,860
Yes.

613
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,640
Meet Jang Yeo-jeong at the amusement park.

614
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,580
Okay sir!

615
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,560
Get out of the way everyone!

616
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,810
Don't be afraid, I'm a cop.

617
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,530
Where are you going!

618
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,880
Why is it still not operational!

619
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,290
This is the operating room.

620
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,750
There's a bomb!

621
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,620
What?

622
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,800
How long will it take
to evacuate everyone?

623
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,410
<i>What does it mean?</i>

624
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,830
Don't do anything until
we give you a signal!

625
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,450
What is it?

626
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,400
<i>Just see for yourself.</i>

627
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,020
<i>Commander, think about
your most painful day.</i>

628
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,620
<i>Today is the day</i>

629
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,710
An old black Starex
car should be nearby

630
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,250
Don't open the window.

631
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,730
I'll look for it, don't worry.

632
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,420
<i>Chief of Staff, it seems that there is
only one Jang Yeo-jeong in the country.</i>

633
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,790
<i>This is not a joke</i>

634
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,150
<i>It was because his identity had been compromised.</i>

635
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,440
<i>I said don't click anything.</i>

636
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,270
<i>I have to go home early
today, so concentrate!</i>

637
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,190
<i>Activated!  The timer is on!</i>

638
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,470
Thirty minutes!

639
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,700
Okay

640
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,500
Let's start.

641
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,200
A BOMB WILL EXPLODE WHEN NCO
JANG YOO-JEONG'S HEAD DROPS

642
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,910
Good grief...

643
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,960
It is attached to the post with super glue.

644
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,800
Cannot be removed.

645
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,300
This is probably a system that is set to
explode when sound exceeds one decibel.

646
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,630
What about the explosive power?

647
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,800
Maybe over 20 pounds.

648
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,740
20 pounds?

649
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,890
And also very close to the building.

650
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,910
Should I tame it?

651
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,840
do it!

652
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,410
Please cooperate

653
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,660
<i>The innermost behind the circuit board is safe.</i>

654
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,700
Well

655
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,050
I will do it.

656
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,950
<i>Did you take a side x-ray?</i>

657
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,120
Not yet.

658
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,890
Stop!  Don't remove the circuit board!

659
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,060
Why?  What's that?

660
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,790
Circuit boards and wires are connected together.

661
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,220
There is still time.

662
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,990
<i>Enter through the slot on the right side of the circuit board.</i>

663
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,840
Unlucky!

664
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,760
There is someone on the second
floor and they are making noise!

665
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,490
<i>How much time is left?</i>

666
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,350
Seven minutes.

667
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,160
<i>Sergeant, the timer's changed on sound.</i>

668
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,230
<i>Yeo-jeong, this bomb is very complicated.</i>

669
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,680
Can't do this, get
out now, Yeo-jeong.

670
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,390
If this exploded, that person would die.

671
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,740
I'll cut it.

672
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,190
Pinch it please!

673
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,220
Unlucky!

674
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,510
We are on the second floor.

675
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,730
Please open the door!

676
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,030
Natatorium here.

677
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,910
<i>You got a call, right?</i>

678
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,250
Yes.

679
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,090
<i>it's okay now,</i>

680
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,720
<i>you can swim.</i>

681
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,440
Hello?

682
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,430
What is going on?

683
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:14,340
Give me the glasses!

684
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,200
Yes!

685
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,390
stop it!

686
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,860
Seol-young, mom is coming home.

687
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,500
Today is my daughter's birthday.

688
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,590
Not today.

689
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,390
<i>30 seconds remaining.</i>

690
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,980
Unlucky!

691
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,550
<i>Chief of Non-commissioned Officers,</i>

692
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,710
<i>I don't see anyone on the
second floor, get out of there!</i>

693
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,790
<i>Hey, Get out of there with 15 seconds left.</i>

694
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,180
<i>Take cover!</i>

695
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,200
<i>Just leave it, it will explode, take cover!</i>

696
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,630
<i>Please run!</i>

697
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,870
<i>Sergeant, are you all right?</i>

698
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,400
Sergeant Jang!  Sergeant Jang!

699
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,000
Jang Yeo Jung!

700
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,230
Here.

701
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,850
This one is fake.

702
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,480
Good grief...

703
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,910
Gosh...you scared me!

704
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,630
Send everyone back.

705
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,710
Do not come close!

706
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,030
Don't panic, it's not over yet.

707
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,240
Stay there!

708
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,150
Where's my daughter?

709
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,890
<i>Honey, is this you?</i>

710
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,090
Yeo-jeong,

711
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,470
It's me.

712
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:21,790
Honey, what's this?

713
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,300
Why is Seol-young's photo here?

714
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,650
<i>Why are you the one answering it?</i>

715
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,210
Get away from the bomb.

716
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,950
Where's Seol Young?

717
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,830
<i>Commander, do you want to
watch someone you love die?</i>

718
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,560
Dear

719
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,340
- Hello?
-<i> It is not controlled by a timer.</i>

720
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,680
<i>Fifth Bomb lowered.</i>

721
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,010
Yeo-jeong, get out of there.

722
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,740
<i>The shape is circle</i>

723
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,610
<i>At a depth of three meters.</i>

724
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,160
Yeo-jeong, get out of there.

725
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,830
<i>If he leaves, Seol-young will die.</i>

726
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,630
Don't listen to him, just run!

727
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,510
Go, hurry!

728
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,890
If he leaves, Seol-young will die.

729
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,100
<i>What's your verdict?</i>

730
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,450
<i>You decide!</i>

731
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,630
No!  Yeo-jeong!

732
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,730
Yeo-jeong, Yeo-jeong!

733
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,950
Kang Do-young, save Seol-young.

734
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,190
No, get out of there!

735
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,650
Just blow me up, asshole!

736
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,670
Yeo-jeong!

737
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:25,780
You're still there, right?

738
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,950
Do not hide.

739
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,390
<i>I told you, don't involve anyone!</i>

740
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,670
Seol-Young

741
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,390
Seol-Young, are you in there?

742
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,260
Seol-Young.

743
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,920
Seol-Young.

744
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,030
Do not open!

745
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,710
Where is Seol Young!

746
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:55,650
Seol-Young!

747
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,670
Let's go.

748
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,000
Don't want to

749
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,180
You can go alone.

750
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:16,550
I'll go home.

751
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,870
Says you're a reporter. Oh.

752
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,150
I'm Oh Bi-oh.

753
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,380
My father didn't want me to get hurt out there.

754
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,830
That's why my name is like that

755
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,440
I'm sorry about what
happened yesterday afternoon

756
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,270
Help me!

757
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,140
I really need your help.

758
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,000
Wait!

759
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,310
Wait.

760
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,620
Damn journalist spirit.

761
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,510
<i>This is Chief of Staff Jang Yoo-jeong's cell phone.</i>

762
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,580
I'm Kang Do Young.

763
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,700
Where's Yoojung?

764
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,540
He is on his way to the hospital.

765
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,920
<i>There's no shrapnel in
the bomb. He'll be fine.</i>

766
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,090
when he wakes up,

767
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,550
Tell him I took Seol-young out.

768
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,270
I understand

769
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,310
I'm grateful!

770
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,600
The sailor's image
suggests that he is a soldier.

771
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,360
I think you know the culprit?

772
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,520
Why don't you say anything?
God, really...

773
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,950
Because you know him too much.

774
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,090
So, you don't want to suspect him, do you?

775
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,740
Many people whose lives
are miserable because of me.

776
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,690
Who's that?

777
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:34,850
We're on our way.

778
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,550
What?

779
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,700
Section head, amusement park exploded.

780
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,920
What about Jang Yoo-jeong?

781
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,700
They weren't sure.

782
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,310
Did you find anything?

783
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,580
The culprit's target was Jang Yoo-jeong.

784
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,390
If Jang Yoo-jeong was still
alive, he would not be happy.

785
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,880
Then what should we do?

786
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,310
Go to the hospital.

787
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,220
[ENDURE]

788
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,110
FORMER USS HALLA CHIEF OFFICER.
KOREAN NAVY CAPTAIN.

789
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,280
<i>Commander Kang Do-young laughed.</i>

790
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,520
With his family outside.

791
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,320
He must be happy to be alive.

792
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,790
Everyone is happy that he can laugh.

793
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,260
We crew are very happy.

794
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,560
After I saw it.

795
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,010
No.

796
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,950
<i>22 loyal crew members,</i>

797
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,330
22 people forever sank to the bottom of the sea.

798
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,900
Getting a medal, getting a national
honor doesn't change anything.

799
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,420
What's the point of getting them out now?

800
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,830
Fuck it, fuck it!

801
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,040
They are still under the sea.

802
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,050
<i>What do you need to do now,</i>

803
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:59,350
Instead of making
Kang Do-young a hero,

804
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,290
<i>but to handcuff him
and put him in jail.</i>

805
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,670
<i>That's a fitting mercy.</i>

806
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,820
<i>At least there...</i>

807
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,510
No one knows.

808
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,100
Now nobody knows.

809
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,270
I will reply.

810
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,650
I will do it.

811
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,180
I have to fight

812
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,070
They suffer a lot

813
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,040
Everyone from the crew,

814
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,300
and I will take revenge for them.

815
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,170
Sorry!

816
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:54,000
Sorry!

817
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,440
Damn, tiring!

818
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,150
Is the story any good?

819
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,750
Something that makes me want to die

820
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,750
Doctor.

821
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,510
Chief Officer, wake up.

822
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:19,710
Commander.

823
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,780
You said Tae-ryeong
just took a nap here.

824
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,500
Yes, take a nap and then go.

825
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,340
Not Tae-ryeong, but
Jeon Tae-seong right?

826
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,990
Tae-seong says to
call him Tae-ryeong.

827
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:36,820
Where is he?

828
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,340
What smell is this?

829
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,250
What's this?

830
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,830
This.

831
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,890
<i>The sinking of Halla</i>

832
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,190
not caused by a torpedo
fired from an enemy ship.

833
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:35,680
You know that.

834
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,680
Jeon Tae-sung.

835
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,190
What are you doing?

836
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,530
Why don't you admit it

837
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,500
It's for your own benefit, right?

838
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,220
Yes, I made the wrong decision

839
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,030
I'll fix it, Tae-seong.

840
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:58,390
Let's meet and talk.

841
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,610
I don't hate you, Commander.

842
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:06,560
You erased the tombstones of
your underlings in the war park.

843
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,660
It still doesn't
make you feel guilty,

844
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:12,350
<i>remember your decision!</i>

845
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,950
Meet me at the MIST Hotel if you want.

846
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:24,110
Does he want to meet you?

847
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,530
What happened?

848
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,910
You know I'm your savior, right?

849
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,750
The torpedoes are on our side.

850
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,330
<i>Right</i>

851
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,950
<i>But only Kang
Do-young knows this.</i>

852
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:51,940
You know Kang Do-young is not a prisoner.

853
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,800
<i>All you have to do is
arrest Kang Do-young</i>

854
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,260
<i>and blame him.</i>

855
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,840
Why did you do it
when you found out?

856
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,900
<i>Hey, that's how
we all do things.</i>

857
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,480
<i>Just do it!</i>

858
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,750
Call the guard and send
Jeon Tae-seong's photo.

859
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,920
Yes, Sir

860
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,150
This is Captain Lee.
We're in a state of emergency.

861
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,090
Call the guard.

862
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:37,410
That's right, Post a photo of Jeon Tae-seong.

863
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,030
Well

864
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,040
What's the matter, sir?

865
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,110
See the woman in the wheelchair
and the young doctor next to you?

866
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,110
What?

867
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,820
<i>Doesn't he look familiar?</i>

868
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,030
Right

869
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,320
<i>Kill him.</i>

870
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,120
Dae-woo.

871
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,630
Lee Dae-woo.

872
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:27,580
Unlucky.

873
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,300
Commander Kang.

874
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:45,140
Say.

875
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,680
Seol Young,

876
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,310
Seol Young...

877
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,440
What happened?

878
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,820
He's being kidnapped

879
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,990
Jeon Tae-sung.

880
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,660
Bomb design drawings are in his house

881
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,620
Please find out how to stop the bomb

882
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,580
Why did he do it?

883
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,580
Did something happen during the disguise?

884
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,880
Only your information is not on file

885
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,590
Sensitive information cannot be recorded.

886
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,010
Help me!

887
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:29,970
I'll tell you later.

888
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,220
Where are you going?

889
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,940
- Use the second channel.
- Well

890
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,700
I'll start from the first floor
and you start from the top.

891
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,700
Okay!

892
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,580
Kang Do-young said
he would tell me later.

893
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,370
So hurry up and catch him!

894
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,710
What does Kang Do-Young
have to do with the incident?

895
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,960
If we don't catch him, we will die.

896
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:03,090
So is this organization

897
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,380
Apparently you already know

898
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,300
Jeon Tae-seong made a mistake.

899
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,090
He's crazy

900
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,930
I didn't know things
would turn out like this.

901
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,060
If we had caught him from the start,
none of this would have happened.

902
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,520
<i>Hey Bastard, two of our teams have already died</i>

903
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,810
This rascal!

904
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,030
He had been preparing for it for so long.

905
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:15,200
It's a multi-core chip.

906
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,580
Satellite chip and countdown timer

907
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:19,210
It's connected to explosives.

908
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,040
Why did he make it?

909
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:39,810
What's this?

910
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,650
What are the plants

911
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,520
Original?

912
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:45,440
It's fake.

913
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:48,400
Who are you?

914
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:51,660
I?

915
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,580
I came to buy some bread.

916
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,960
You saw the meter, right?

917
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,000
Yes.

918
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,250
If it crosses the red line, it will explode.

919
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:04,880
What?

920
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,670
It will explode if people
move or make noise.

921
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,170
Want to push the button?

922
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:09,920
Yes

923
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:12,430
Has begun.

924
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,600
Excuse me.

925
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,440
Go.

926
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,820
Go.

927
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:31,740
- No.
- Oh no.

928
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,610
Ahjussi who are you disturbing our chat?

929
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,870
- Ahjussi do you know me?
- Who are you?

930
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,620
Customer at table No.
17, here's your latte...

931
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,080
Shut up.

932
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,620
Here's your Latte.

933
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,390
Get down!

934
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,270
What is he doing there?

935
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:02,890
A little annoying

936
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,820
Hoax.

937
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:20,120
Damn it!

938
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,530
Bring Kang Do-young to me.

939
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,210
- And...
- Sir.

940
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,510
Mayor Wu Gyun-ho is here.  Let's go.

941
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,010
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

942
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:32,400
Yes

943
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,030
<i>It's a special bomb.</i>

944
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:35,610
He has a goal.

945
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,530
There is a composition of precision instruments on his vest.

946
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,080
He has made more than two bombs.

947
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,000
He connects two vests.

948
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,670
<i>He hid your daughter somewhere.</i>

949
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,920
<i>If one of the vests moves
away, it will explode.</i>

950
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,010
How do you get the bomb out?

951
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,090
If two vests are

952
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,760
within one meter,

953
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,970
it will stop.

954
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,890
I'm on the forums.

955
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:03,930
There is no one in the VIP section.

956
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,850
VIPs are gone.

957
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,650
<i>Jeon Tae-seong knows about the torpedoes.</i>

958
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,270
We can't go after him.
We need to predict his actions.

959
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,030
I found Seol-young.

960
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,200
<i>He's at the coffee shop
across from the hotel.</i>

961
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,450
He didn't seem hurt.  But..

962
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,290
He's wearing a vest.

963
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:29,410
He couldn't move.

964
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,250
<i>I'm with Seol-young.</i>

965
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,920
<i>Come early.</i>

966
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,920
<i>Hi everybody!</i>

967
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,920
<i>I'm from Halla Ship, Jeon Tae-Seong</i>

968
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,930
Today, a year ago,

969
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,680
We lost 22 of our members,

970
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,140
in a very cold sea.

971
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,730
These are the leaders who left us

972
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:46,160
Please, sit.

973
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,290
There's a bomb at the gate.

974
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:49,160
Jeon Tae-sung.

975
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:08,260
You must be tired all day, right?

976
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:10,390
It will be over soon.

977
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,230
let them go.

978
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,280
Don't worry about them.

979
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,190
You should be worried about Seol-young.

980
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,780
My vest is connected to hers.

981
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,240
If it explodes,

982
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:30,410
Seol-young also dies.

983
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:33,290
Stop it, it's our problem.

984
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,750
Vice captain,

985
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,790
this is my dream!

986
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,210
Addicted people make
mistakes to achieve their dreams

987
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:47,140
Therefore, do as I command!

988
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,230
Come out.

989
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,520
Come out, Tae-seong.
I will help you

990
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,110
Do you smell anything?

991
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:06,570
Isn't it terrible
humidity and foggy air

992
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:08,030
smell bad?

993
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:13,620
We're in the water,
don't you understand?

994
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,920
This is my fault.

995
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,340
Tae-seong, I'll take responsibility.

996
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:21,840
I will take responsibility.

997
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,420
Responsible?

998
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,130
Responsible?

999
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:36,310
Nothing could recover from that day.

1000
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:40,190
No one has brought up the truth

1001
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,400
None!

1002
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,820
I don't care about the bad guys.

1003
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:46,650
However

1004
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:50,030
Kang Do-young and Kim Yoo-taek

1005
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,660
take advantage of their deaths

1006
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,170
Tae-seong.

1007
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,130
Tae-ryeong

1008
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,590
still at sea.

1009
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,950
11 DAYS AFTER THE SUB-SHIPPING SOUND THE CORALS

1010
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,490
This is not what we expected

1011
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,120
They found the cause, right?

1012
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:41,500
Yes.

1013
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,790
It seems it was because of the tornado.

1014
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,460
Luckily we managed to fix
the communication equipment.

1015
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,010
Headquarters will dispatch people.

1016
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,930
vice captain

1017
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,310
probably looking for a way out too!

1018
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,600
Of course.

1019
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,980
Is the bachelor nim a god?

1020
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,230
Can he make oxygen?

1021
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,900
What about carbon dioxide?

1022
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,030
Irritating

1023
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,110
Slow death is not good

1024
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,080
I'd rather hit an iceberg.

1025
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,580
Lieutenant Kim,

1026
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:21,830
if we hit an iceberg,
we will all die.

1027
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,420
The vice captain
is working on it.

1028
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,670
He will find his way.

1029
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,270
Here is the emergency telegram.

1030
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,170
15 days...

1031
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,300
Vice captain.

1032
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,880
How about the condition?

1033
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,430
19 percent oxygen, 4
percent carbon dioxide.

1034
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,980
The torpedoes must be ours.

1035
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,230
We lost it in international
waters recently.

1036
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,610
Those are our K201 torpedoes.

1037
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,450
If we carry on, everyone will die.

1038
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,740
No matter how we do the simulation,

1039
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,660
there was no way they could be saved.

1040
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,830
The US military thinks so too.

1041
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:33,750
Nothing to save?

1042
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:35,800
Yes.

1043
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,550
Close this issue

1044
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,980
Don't let other people know.

1045
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:51,310
About the tornado.

1046
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,270
Oxygen and carbon dioxide

1047
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,990
can only support them
for six days at most.

1048
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,360
In fact they started
the rescue on the 14th,

1049
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,740
oxygen will not be enough.

1050
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,710
What's the best choice for us?

1051
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,790
This is an emergency telegram from the Halla ship.

1052
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,180
I don't qualify for

1053
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,720
decide if they
should do something.

1054
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,310
Vice-captain Kang definitely understands.

1055
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,400
Does anyone disagree?

1056
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,150
Okay

1057
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,490
There's no way.
What should we do?

1058
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:44,820
Can't

1059
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:47,120
No one can give orders.

1060
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,700
I don't think we can live together.

1061
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,870
You want us to die together?

1062
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,210
Leader has allowed.

1063
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,080
On what basis?

1064
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,630
We should at least save one person.

1065
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,790
Who must be saved?  Who decides?

1066
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,000
My partner might die because of me.

1067
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:00,300
At least one person must be saved.

1068
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,220
- Will never.
- Hey Bastard!

1069
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,800
- Please.
- Stop.

1070
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,050
Please stop it!

1071
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,050
I don't agree.

1072
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:08,350
We will die if we keep talking.

1073
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:09,890
Yes, let's live.

1074
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,770
At least one person must be saved.

1075
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:13,600
Right, right?

1076
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:15,770
Vice-captain, no!

1077
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:16,810
That is not true!

1078
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,320
Let's think rationally

1079
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,940
You want to sacrifice other people's lives?

1080
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:20,990
You want everyone to die?

1081
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:21,860
Think carefully!

1082
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,990
Your brother Tae-ryeong can be saved.

1083
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,030
You don't want to be saved?

1084
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,450
Why do this?

1085
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,580
Damn it!

1086
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,580
Stop.

1087
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,210
- How can we choose?
- Stop.

1088
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,290
- You want to die?
- Stop!

1089
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,550
It's enough!

1090
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,480
<i>Everything,</i>

1091
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,860
<i>Thank you for your persistence</i>

1092
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,860
<i>There's a tornado on our ship.</i>

1093
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,580
<i>After it's gone,</i>

1094
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>the rescue team will arrive in 14 days at the earliest.</i>

1095
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:16,250
<i>If there is no storm in 14 days,</i>

1096
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:19,790
<i>rescue team can work for 24 hours</i>

1097
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,300
<i>to save us.</i>

1098
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,720
<i>That's the fastest solution.</i>

1099
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:28,260
<i>Carbon dioxide</i>

1100
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,890
<i>and oxygen can last
a maximum of 4 days.</i>

1101
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,390
<i>For the most extreme
situation, We can stay for 6 days.</i>

1102
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,610
<i>After that, I won't
say anything more.</i>

1103
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:42,940
<i>I</i>

1104
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,450
<i>I aim to save as many
members as possible.</i>

1105
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:50,370
<i>However, we were unable to save
everyone due to circumstances.</i>

1106
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,370
<i>Thus, we can only
save half the members</i>

1107
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,330
<i>or</i>

1108
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,630
<i>quarter members.</i>

1109
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,130
<i>Or maybe</i>

1110
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,300
<i>We can only save one person,</i>

1111
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,180
<i>This seems the right way.</i>

1112
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,270
<i>Let's decide quickly.</i>

1113
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,560
<i>Save half or die together.</i>

1114
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,570
<i>I can't decide.</i>

1115
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,990
<i>We will choose the way that is
supported by more than half of the people.</i>

1116
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,330
What is this blank?

1117
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,210
They want to follow your decisions

1118
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,930
Four people disagree.

1119
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,930
Four people agree.

1120
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,850
Other people want to follow my decisions.

1121
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,530
Quickly decide who you want to save!

1122
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,030
- Wait, vice-captain.
- Older brother

1123
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:13,410
Do not!

1124
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,220
There are 44 ropes!

1125
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,590
If you choose one of them,

1126
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,220
You can't change
it, it's a rule!

1127
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:39,310
If all members get
the shortest rope,

1128
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,560
the person with the highest
rank would carry out the order.

1129
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:43,060
Do you understand?

1130
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,610
-Yes.
-Yes.

1131
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,190
The short leash will be sacrificed.

1132
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,450
The long rope lasts.

1133
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:52,530
Agreed!

1134
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,290
Carry on.

1135
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,280
Carry on.

1136
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,630
Take this

1137
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,050
Why are you like this?

1138
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,260
Grab it fast!

1139
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,890
No need.

1140
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,180
It's okay, listen to me.

1141
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,600
Stop it, brother.

1142
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,310
Jeon Tae Ryeong.

1143
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,320
You really don't want to hear me?

1144
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,650
Stop!

1145
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:10,280
Take it!  No problem!

1146
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,240
Do not do this!

1147
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,280
Jeon Tae Ryeong.

1148
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,360
Take!

1149
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,820
stop it!

1150
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,540
What is it?

1151
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,080
You can't change it.

1152
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,580
It's my decision.

1153
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,500
I don't agree.

1154
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,590
It's an order.

1155
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,670
Tae-ryeong is my little brother.

1156
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,800
Do not do it.

1157
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:34,760
Jeon Tae-sung.

1158
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,510
It's an order.

1159
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,520
The Navy can't kill itself.

1160
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:52,360
Friends!

1161
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:56,740
You all know?

1162
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:58,780
We can't do it!

1163
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,290
Do not say that again.

1164
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,580
It's enough.

1165
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,410
I will not give up.

1166
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,380
Your orders are so ridiculous

1167
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,840
Like a man who has lost his mind

1168
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:15,220
I want to cancel the order from the Vice Captain!

1169
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:16,630
Lieutenant Kim!

1170
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,260
Jail him!

1171
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,640
Friends.

1172
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,770
Friends!

1173
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:29,650
You all know?

1174
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,860
You all know that?

1175
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,400
Friends!

1176
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,070
Enough!

1177
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,740
Captain Jeon Tae-seong.

1178
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,830
From now on, you are suspended.

1179
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,040
On whose orders?

1180
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,630
I want to stop you!

1181
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,210
Jail him!

1182
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:55,380
Jail him.

1183
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:03,890
Representative!  Vice captain!

1184
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:04,470
Older brother

1185
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,930
Wait a moment!

1186
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:06,850
Older brother

1187
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,060
Vice captain!

1188
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,350
Deputy Captain, please!

1189
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,440
Let us swap the ropes!

1190
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,280
Let us swap!

1191
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,400
Vice captain!

1192
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,240
Let us change the rope!

1193
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,170
Please let us exchange!

1194
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,210
Vice captain!

1195
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:41,550
We should all be dead by then.

1196
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,640
No.

1197
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,270
Tae-ryeong and I were dead by then.

1198
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,060
I regret one thing.

1199
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:55,940
At that time, I should have
let you change the rope.

1200
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:02,280
I'm sorry, Tae-seong.

1201
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,140
You know where Seol-young is.

1202
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,390
You don't want to know where Sergeant Jang is?

1203
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,060
He was in the car
across from Seol-young.

1204
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,070
This vest can crack.

1205
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,960
You have three minutes.

1206
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,960
Choose one or let both die.

1207
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:40,670
That is your choice.

1208
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,980
JEON TAE SEONG

1209
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,260
Dad's at the coffee shop.

1210
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:37,180
I can't go.

1211
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:39,350
Uncle, who are you?

1212
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,200
Kang Do Young!

1213
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:00,860
What are you doing?

1214
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:03,070
Give up.

1215
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,580
POLICE

1216
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:37,440
Where's my dad?

1217
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,110
He will come here soon.

1218
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,060
You can't go there!

1219
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,230
- What happened?
- What's wrong with him?

1220
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,190
You can't go there!

1221
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:55,990
Don't come here, honey!

1222
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:57,080
Stop!

1223
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,950
-Impossible!
- Stop him, please!

1224
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:59,750
- That is dangerous!
- Very dangerous!

1225
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,700
Dear...

1226
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,790
Where is Seol-Young？

1227
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,460
Right up front.

1228
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:10,310
LIMITED ACCESS

1229
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,850
Does not matter.

1230
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:09,230
Seol-young, Daddy's coming!

1231
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,160
I'm sorry, Seol-Young.

1232
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,850
Are you on good terms with Ho-yeon?

1233
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:41,010
No, not yet.

1234
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:41,970
Why?

1235
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,600
Who knows!

1236
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:48,150
It's harder than you thought, right?

1237
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,060
Actually no.

1238
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:52,360
You said you wanted to make up with him?

1239
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,440
Yes.

1240
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:00,570
Dad chose this, didn't he?

1241
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,660
Yes.

1242
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,250
I miss you.

1243
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,180
The reason why I
came here, was to clarify

1244
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:31,060
the truth of the
Halla Ship incident.

1245
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,150
Due to the typhoon
and bad weather,

1246
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:36,820
it took us 20 days
to find Halla Ship.

1247
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,450
In those 20 days...

1248
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:41,740
The oxygen in it has decreased.

1249
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,450
The oxygen can only be used by
44 people for a maximum of 7 days.

1250
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,620
In my opinion, if everyone dies.

1251
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,210
Then there is no rescue plan.

1252
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:54,340
22 lieutenants were killed.

1253
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,090
They didn't die because the
control room wall collapsed.

1254
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,090
This is all because of
my reckless decision!

1255
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:05,720
I'm in charge of everything.

1256
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:09,980
I apologize.

1257
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:13,810
Which country lost the torpedoes?

1258
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:16,070
Republic of Korea.

1259
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:19,320
How much oxygen
is left after rescue?

1260
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:22,160
Almost nothing left

1261
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:24,620
Don't you have something
to say to the bereaved?

1262
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,870
Can't you save a lot of people?

1263
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,370
I should have made another long line.

1264
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:34,840
I am sorry.

1265
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,470
If I could go back to that time,

1266
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:45,260
What kind of decision did you make?

1267
01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:05,580
YOUNG-WOO TOMB

1268
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,340
Is my decision right?

1269
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,430
You have to stay tough.

1270
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,480
Take a look at our colleagues

1271
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,780
It would be very painful if alive.

1272
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:44,860
My turn.

1273
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,170
Not that.

1274
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:00,630
I've arranged the end

1275
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,840
Bujangnim, you must be safe

1276
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,930
If we run out of oxygen in the
future, we'll have to draw again.

1277
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:10,180
Young-woo.

1278
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,360
All the crew who have pulled
the short rope, Gather here!

1279
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:33,120
Deputy Captain and colleagues

1280
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:36,750
Stop crying!

1281
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:38,830
We must separate immediately!

1282
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:50,510
If we don't go down, the
rest will find it hard to breathe.

1283
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:02,270
Be sure to survive.

1284
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:08,280
Let's reconsider.

1285
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:08,780
There will be other solutions.

1286
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:10,200
There is no solution anymore

1287
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:14,160
If the ship goes
down, we will all die.

1288
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:26,630
Bujangnim must take
the responsibility of others.

1289
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:33,350
I understand.

1290
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:42,480
Attention!

1291
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:18,310
Get off!

1292
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,070
Let's go.

1293
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:22,010
KIM HON-CHUL, JEON TAE-RYEONG

1294
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:05,330
26 NAVY WARRIORS

1295
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,180
Attention!

1296
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,680
Respect!

1297
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:35,680
-- TRANSLATIONED BY AZHLAF--

1298
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:28,290
DECIBEL

1299
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,710
Hey, where are you going?

1300
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,750
Come here, take
photos in a sweet way

1301
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:34,630
Come here!

1302
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,840
Here!

1303
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:38,050
How to do it?

1304
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:39,880
Here!

1305
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:43,640
What's this?

1306
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,100
Are you embarrassed now?

1307
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:48,600
No, not me.

1308
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,650
I don't really like photos, sir!

1309
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,400
No, my sister really likes it.

1310
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,270
Really?

1311
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:56,190
Let's take one

1312
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:58,030
Hey, and also...

1313
01:42:58,030 --> 01:42:59,030
If there were only the three of us,

1314
01:42:59,030 --> 01:43:00,070
Stop calling me Bujangnim!

1315
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:01,490
Call me brother, understand?

1316
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,280
Yes, Deputy!

1317
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,120
What?  What happened?

1318
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:04,780
No, nothing.

1319
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,410
One two..

1320
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:06,790
I say "one, two, three"
and call me brother.

1321
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:08,790
Let's try, "one, two, three".

1322
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:09,830
- Brothers

1323
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,000
All right, let's gather more people.

1324
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,790
Bring them here.

1325
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:14,170
- Bring them all here
- Call and get them.

1326
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:15,380
Yes, Minister.

1327
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:20,380
I think he's getting more and more like me.

1328
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:24,100
Come on, let's take a photo.

1329
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:26,220
One two three!
