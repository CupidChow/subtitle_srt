1
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,916
LOVE FOR REAL STARTS NOW

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,291
A reality dating show, huh?

3
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,541
FINDING LOVE AFTER SCHOOL

4
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,333
What could've prompted you
to say yes to this?

5
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:42,416
I realized it's convenient for me
to be in entertainment.

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:44,958
Convenient for what?

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,250
Well, don't rock the boat too much.

8
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,041
I won't.

9
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,875
Welcome to the first day of Love for Real.

10
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,333
Good luck.

11
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,916
Thank you.

12
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,500
We encourage you to converse freely.

13
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,583
But just be aware of fixed camera angles.

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,875
The red dots indicate fixed rig positions.

15
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,833
Try to ignore the cameramen,
and keep talking.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,791
No looking at the cameras,

17
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,541
and don't touch your pin mics.

18
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,625
Understood.

19
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,708
That is all.

20
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,333
Let's make a great show, everybody.

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,250
Let's do this! Whaddya say?

22
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,291
-Yeah! I can't wait!
-Yeah.

23
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,708
-Whaddya say?
-Yeah…

24
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,166
Yeah.

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,625
Best of luck.

26
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,083
-Thank you.
-Same, Thank you.

27
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,208
LOVE FOR REAL STARTS NOW

28
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:42,333
How do you do?
I'm Yuki, a high school sophomore.

29
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,791
And a model.

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,416
I'm Kengo. I'm a senior.

31
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,500
I'm lead member for the band "Dreams."

32
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,958
Nobuyuki Kumano, junior from Kumamoto.

33
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,291
Call me Nobu.

34
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,791
I'm Mem-cho.

35
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,791
Um…I'm a…

36
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,083
High school senior.

37
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:07,083
I'm a YouTuber aiming for
a million subscribers. Pleasure.

38
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,541
I'm Aqua, high school sophomore and actor.

39
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,500
Glad to be here.

40
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:18,208
I'm Akane Kurokawa, junior, 17.
I'm an actress.

41
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,958
I view this show as a means
for personal growth…

42
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:26,208
You needn't be so stiff. Relax.

43
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,458
Thank you.

44
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,125
-Thank you too.
-Thanks.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,416
Why do you keep grinning like that?

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:43,166
I'm just so stoked I'll be crushing on
one of you soon.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,875
Don't say that. Now I feel awkward.

48
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,291
What the hell?

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,375
Could Aqua be any more superficial?

50
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,208
He's usually so sullen and introverted.

51
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,958
You look like an actor, Aqua. So cool.

52
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,708
You're cute as a button, Mem-cho.

53
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,208
-What?
-Barf.

54
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,541
Aqua's an actor. He's playing
the role required of him.

55
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,333
Speaking of which, why is he
getting work and not us?

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:19,041
Relax. A long journey begins
with a single step.

57
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,833
Then where's that step?

58
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,833
Tell us what to do, Ms. Saitoh. Please!

59
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,291
Okay then, how about starting up
a YouTube channel?

60
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
A YouTube channel?

61
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,333
I know an expert who might help us.

62
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,416
But Boss?

63
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,375
Now what is it?

64
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:44,500
Don't these reality dating shows
always end with a confession of love?

65
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,250
They do, yes.

66
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,916
Even if staged, it's in the contract.

67
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,083
If a couple is born, don't they kiss?

68
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,333
I'd cringe if it was Aqua.

69
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,083
Don't watch, then.

70
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,333
How could I not?

71
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,000
Just look away.

72
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,958
That jerk.

73
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,958
Why'd he agree to a job like this?

74
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,750
This show is my big chance.

75
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,166
I'm hoping to use it as a springboard
to diversify my career.

76
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,250
Really?

77
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,708
Each member had different aims.

78
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:31,250
Mine was simply to find clues
about my biological father.

79
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,958
If you agree to appear,

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,041
I'll share deep backstage tales of Ai.

81
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:42,416
For example, stories about
the men in her life.

82
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,916
What about you?

83
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,958
Aren't you interested in love?

84
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,541
Of course. Who wouldn't be?

85
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
I'm a normal high school teen.

86
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:02,541
Did you know Season 1 ended with
a kiss consummating the couple?

87
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,041
You know what?

88
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,833
I could see myself kissing you, Aqua.

89
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,250
Don't move.

90
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,666
This shot will surely be aired.

91
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,583
Reality shows don't use scripts.

92
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,458
Excuse me, but was I okay today?

93
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,500
But they heavily rely on staging.

94
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,958
It would help if you could stand
a bit closer to the boys.

95
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,041
Viewers want to feel nervous, too.

96
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,750
Understood. I'll try that.

97
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,833
Cast members can take
director notes as advice…

98
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,666
or as instruction.

99
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,250
Is there anyone in particular
that I should talk to?

100
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,625
Akane Kurokawa sees them as the latter.

101
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,791
Seriously?

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,875
What are these costumes?

103
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,291
Ms. Saitoh's YouTuber friend
said to wait in these.

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
What?

105
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,625
Come in.

106
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,208
Oh my God, is that Pieyon?

107
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,083
Pieyon at your service.

108
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,500
What… who's that?

109
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,500
A masked workout trainer that
middle school kids love.

110
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,791
I'm Pieyon.

111
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:58,666
Wow, I didn't think cheap TV character
gimmicks would work on the Internet.

112
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,416
I make 100 million yen a year.

113
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,708
Forget what I just said.

114
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,916
-Don't burn it.
-It's burning.

115
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,833
I'm thinking of leaving the show.

116
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,000
What? Why?

117
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,625
What for?

118
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,625
Comments from kids at school and online

119
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,750
have been pretty harsh. I can't take it.

120
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,333
I hear you.

121
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,541
I have my own channel,
so I get all kinds of comments.

122
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,375
Not all positive. But still…

123
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,458
NEXT WEEK, A SHOCKING TWIST

124
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,625
Wait!

125
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:57,333
Why are you so nice to me, Nobu?
I don't deserve it.

126
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,541
Because Yuki…

127
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,625
FEELINGS INTENSIFY

128
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,708
…you're important.

129
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,708
We're trending hard.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,416
You're kidding.

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,916
Oh my God Yuki, you're going viral.

132
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,250
As long as I contribute to the show.

133
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,375
-Are you all right now?
-About what?

134
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,916
All the bashing at school and online.

135
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,666
Totally. That's just part of the business.

136
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,833
So that was all just an act?

137
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,125
More like an exaggeration.

138
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,166
I really was getting picked on at school,

139
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,666
and truly wanted to quit.

140
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,458
Shooting starts so early, too.

141
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,375
-Exactly.
-Yup.

142
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,125
Look at this photo I took of Nobu.

143
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,541
-No way.
-It's priceless.

144
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,250
The more we relaxed, the clearer
the personalities became.

145
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,708
I changed my makeup recently.

146
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,083
Some presented themselves well.

147
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,958
Group photo time.

148
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:05,041
Some had presence, or what you saw
was what you got.

149
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,875
-Say cheese.
-Others were rarely on screen.

150
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,958
Okay!

151
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,083
Nice. Group text that later.

152
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,000
-Okay. Sure.
-Don't forget.

153
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,291
Who's up for Korean barbecue?

154
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,875
-I am. Let's go!
-Sounds good.

155
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,875
-What should we eat?
-Sorry, but I think I'll decline.

156
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,708
What? Why?

157
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:33,541
Didn't the show runners say we're
not supposed to socialize off set?

158
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,125
We'll keep it quiet.

159
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,541
-Yeah, come on.
-Beef tongue.

160
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,125
-Beef tongue, yes! I'm starving.
-Let's go then.

161
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,208
Which shop?

162
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,833
Can you do a search?

163
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,458
-Someplace good.
-Thin beef tongue.

164
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,666
Good food.

165
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:59,291
Korean BBQ's a bit rich
for a high school freshman.

166
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:04,458
Sounds so delish.
And in such lovely company, too.

167
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,166
Part of the job.

168
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,541
What were you doing?

169
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,666
Shooting a YouTube video.

170
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,625
"Real teens after school," my ass.

171
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,791
If so, then why the hell
do you shoot on weekends?

172
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,666
To prioritize education.

173
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,833
The word for it is "staged."

174
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,125
It's a lot more real than you think.

175
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,916
It is?

176
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,083
You mean everyone's falling in love
for real?

177
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,833
I guess that depends on the person.

178
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,500
For me, it's just work.

179
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,583
But surprisingly…

180
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,875
reality shows do a pretty good job

181
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,166
of showing people for who they are.

182
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,916
All the more reason you need
to lie as a cover.

183
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,041
Or public opinion will tear you apart.

184
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,791
Sounds pretty brutal.

185
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,000
Lies…

186
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,958
are your greatest defense weapon.

187
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,833
KUROKAWA

188
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,333
AKANE ADDS NOTHING TO THE SHOW.

189
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:41,541
DID YOU SEE THE NASTY LOOK ON HER FACE?

190
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,333
Thanks for your hard work.

191
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,416
Thank you too.

192
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
LALA LAI THEATRICAL COMPANY

193
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,291
I knew I didn't want her on that show!

194
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,250
But you insisted it opened doors.

195
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,291
She hasn't registered so much as a peep!

196
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,916
I assure you Akane is doing her best.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,458
That's not cutting it.

198
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,875
Light a fire under her butt
and make her leave a mark.

199
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:27,958
Akane.

200
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm so sorry for disappointing everyone.

201
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,166
Don't worry about it.

202
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,916
You're doing great, Akane.

203
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,625
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

204
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,916
A little more to the right.

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THE GANG HOLDS A BIRTHDAY BASH FOR NOBU

206
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,375
It's beautiful!

207
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,500
I hope Nobu will like it.

208
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,500
I just…

209
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:06,916
THAT NIGHT, YUKI DECIDES TO MAKE HER MOVE

210
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,791
This girl Yuki is about to get
hugely popular.

211
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,666
She's the linchpin on Love for Real.

212
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,291
The show revolves around her.

213
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,250
My fave is Mem-cho.
Akane is too out of the picture.

214
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,625
That was cool.

215
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,375
-Was it really?
-Yeah.

216
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,791
How can I change things to make my mark?

217
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,458
Try a villainess move.

218
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,083
A villainess move?

219
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,625
Move in on Nobu from Yuki.

220
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,083
That'll surely draw attention to you.

221
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,125
It may lower your likability temporarily,
but you'll be noticed.

222
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,125
I see.

223
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,625
Don't get me wrong.
This is not a directive.

224
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,541
Yes, I know.

225
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,083
After all, popularity hinges on
establishing a character.

226
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,375
It leaves a mark.

227
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,250
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

228
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,250
You can do it.

229
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,708
Hey, Akane.

230
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,583
Sorry, but can I borrow Nobu a sec?

231
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,375
What? Oh… sure.

232
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:53,916
Follow me.

233
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,291
Excuse me.

234
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,791
What's up?

235
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,208
I just wanted to talk.

236
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,833
AKANE IS ONE EVIL CHICK.

237
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,333
SO DESPERATE JUST TO STAND OUT. LOSER.

238
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,500
MAKING A DIRTY MOVE. LOL.

239
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:19,041
It's got to be better than being
totally invisible.

240
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,250
Hey, how's it going?

241
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,500
All right, I guess.

242
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,875
You're not contending for the main love.

243
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,625
To be honest, I'm not here for that.

244
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,208
I plan to play it safe.

245
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,333
More importantly…

246
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,541
I'd like to hear about Ai.

247
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,083
When we're done here,
I'll give you the juicy lowdown.

248
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,875
This is adorable!

249
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,583
My nail stylist sister taught me.

250
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,583
This raises the stakes. Thanks.

251
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
My pleasure.

252
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,666
I'm gonna post this right away.

253
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,416
That's so cool.

254
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,125
I'll do yours, too, Akane. Come.

255
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,708
Okay.

256
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,875
You seem a bit flustered lately, Akane.

257
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,125
The show's ending soon.

258
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:58,166
So I get where you're coming from.
But I'm worried.

259
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,041
I feel like I have to leave a mark
in some way.

260
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,041
Yeah, I totally get it.

261
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:12,958
But…

262
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,041
I'll do what it takes to stand out.

263
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,083
Try not to hate me for it, okay?

264
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,250
I won't. We're both in this together.

265
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,125
I'm glad.

266
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,041
I'm sure you've already solidified
your feelings for someone.

267
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,916
But I hope you don't mind
if I keep on trying.

268
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,250
Sure.

269
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,000
You scared me.

270
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,708
Let's go roast some marshmallows.

271
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,208
We're in the middle of a serious talk.

272
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,041
Oh, you were? Sorry.

273
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,708
I wish you'd stop doing that.

274
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,083
Aren't you ashamed of how
you fawn over guys?

275
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,500
I "fawn over" everyone, not just guys.

276
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,708
I show my love for people.

277
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,875
That includes you, Akane.

278
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,125
Don't touch me!

279
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Stop the cameras!

280
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,291
Are you all right?

281
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,541
She's bleeding.

282
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,625
Call her manager.

283
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,916
First aid kit!

284
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm so sorry.

285
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:54,166
I didn't mean for that to happen, I swear.

286
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,458
Please forgive me, Yuki.

287
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,708
It's all right.

288
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh my God.

289
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,916
Calm down.

290
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,916
Don't you have a magazine shoot tomorrow?

292
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,083
Don't worry. They can Photoshop this out.

293
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,750
I can't apologize enough.

294
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,583
I understand.

295
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,291
You're under pressure to perform.
You just whiffed a bit.

296
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,125
It's all good.

297
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,041
I know the real you.

298
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,583
You're a hard worker.

299
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,041
I admire that.

300
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,000
Please don't cry.

301
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,083
In any group of people,

302
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,666
-friction will arise.
-Keep crying, your eyes will puff up.

303
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,125
But it's surprising how easily

304
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,791
it can lead to understanding.

305
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
-Then again…
-Smile.

306
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,208
NEXT WEEK'S WILD FINISH

307
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,708
-That includes you, Akane.
-Don't touch me!

308
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,000
AKANE RAISED A HAND AT YUKI

309
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,708
SPAWNED BY JEALOUSY

310
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,125
Did she scratch Yuki?

311
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,416
Oh my God!

312
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,625
What a disastrous finish.

313
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,708
Yeah, for Akane.

314
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,458
She's toast.

315
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,000
-A bit overboard?
-Totally.

316
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,666
We're posting this.

317
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,500
She's really like that?

318
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,000
She's getting cocky.

319
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,500
DON'T WANT TO SEE HER FACE.

320
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,333
I HOPE SHE GETS IN AN ACCIDENT.

321
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,666
DON'T BE ON TV EVER AGAIN!

322
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,250
The Internet is unforgiving.

323
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,875
YOU'RE SO GROSS, AKANE.

324
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,125
Did you see Akane?

325
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,083
Can you believe it?

326
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,333
She's screwed.

327
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,375
I saw it coming.

328
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,833
She's always had a bad personality.

329
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,000
So stuck up.

330
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,416
She goes around acting like
she's better than us.

331
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,791
It's obnoxious.

332
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,875
Like "I'm an actress."

333
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,666
Get over yourself.

334
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,541
Total unknown.

335
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,791
Sorry.

336
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,333
You call that an apology?

337
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:51,833
Don't show your face again.

338
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,916
I feel so bad for Yuki.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,333
Arrest her for assault.

340
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,750
This is what she gets
for being cocky.

341
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,250
Her life is over.

342
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,208
She should've stayed quiet.

343
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,416
Uncalled for.

344
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,166
Why don't you disappear?

345
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,000
Retire now.

346
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,583
Are you okay?

347
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:27,833
I'm fine.

348
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,291
HOW CAN YOU LIVE?
I'll SOCK YOU IF I SEE YOU.

349
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,375
Whoah, she's getting flamed to a crisp.

350
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,583
Okay, the slap was a mistake.

351
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,750
But it wasn't intentional.
Why are people so mean?

352
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,541
She shouldn't have apologized online.

353
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:56,833
Why?

354
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,583
Apologies go far in Japanese society.

355
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,916
But online, it only fuels more flaming.

356
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,125
Apologizing is acknowledgment of guilt.

357
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,250
She's just inviting people to abuse her.

358
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,583
That's pretty twisted.

359
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:20,625
It's not only twisted, it's super stupid.

360
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,875
Sadly, this is going to impact
her career for sure.

361
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,875
Akane is Lala Lai Theatrical's
marquee actress.

362
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,833
A prodigy in theater circles.

363
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,083
I didn't know she was that famous.

364
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,208
As long as she drops out, I'm fine.

365
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:42,333
What did you say?

366
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,458
No, I meant "as a professional rival."

367
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:50,083
Japanese is scary. So easily misconstrued.

368
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,583
Try keeping your mouth shut, then.

369
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,291
Don't you shoot on Saturdays?

370
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,750
Canceled. A typhoon's coming.

371
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,125
What about next week's stream?

372
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,583
It'll be a highlight episode.

373
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,041
Plus, the flaming of Akane isn't abating.

374
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,083
Akane, dear?

375
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,375
Feeling better?

376
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,125
Do you want to go see a doctor?

377
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:42,000
No, I'm just tired adjusting to
an unfamiliar work schedule.

378
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,375
I just need rest.

379
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,916
Are you sure?

380
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:51,083
I'm going over to your grandma's.

381
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,125
Call me if you need anything.

382
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,208
I will. Thank you, Mom.

383
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,166
LOVE FOR REAL GROUP CHAT

384
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,875
JUST IGNORE THEM.

385
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:23,875
HOW'RE YOU DOING? ARE YOU EATING?

386
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,041
Come to think of it,
I haven't eaten a thing.

387
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,875
I'LL GO BUY SOMETHING.

388
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,375
ARREST HER FOR BODILY ASSAULT.

389
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,416
SHE MAKES ME SICK.

390
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,541
I wish everything would go away.

391
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,125
Enough is enough.

392
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,333
I'm tired.

393
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,541
No! Let go of me! Help!

394
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,458
Take it easy, Akane!

395
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,916
I'm not your enemy.
I'm begging you to calm down.

396
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,583
Aqua? But how?

397
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,333
You two!

398
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,166
What're you doing out here?

399
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,625
It's dangerous!

400
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:26,833
DEPOSITION FORM

401
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,416
You didn't notice anything wrong
with your daughter?

402
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,250
She insisted

403
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,750
that I not watch the show.

404
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,708
I'm not online much.

405
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,750
I had no idea it was this bad.

406
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,791
It's not my mom's fault.

407
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,291
Why didn't you come to me?

408
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,875
I didn't want to worry you, Mom.

409
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,375
Thank you.

410
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:26,708
I wasn't thrilled the police called.

411
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,333
But you did good.

412
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,583
Online trolling hurts the serious ones
the most.

413
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,083
But you looked out for her.

414
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,750
People are fragile creatures.

415
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,625
When there's a cry for help,

416
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,750
you have to move quick.

417
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:00,000
Aqua! How is she?

418
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,208
She's being questioned.

419
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,583
-Is she hurt?
-No.

420
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,416
Thank God.

421
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,375
Thank you, Officer.

422
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:10,750
-Akane!
-Akane!

423
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:14,458
You guys.

424
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,583
You okay?

425
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,833
We were worried.

426
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,500
What a relief you're okay.

427
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,375
I'm sorry, Akane.

428
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,083
It's my fault, isn't it?

429
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:27,875
No, it's not.

430
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:35,958
Akane.

431
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,833
What do you want to do now?

432
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,791
You're free to drop out of the show.

433
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,250
But the contract.

434
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,916
The showrunners could be held
liable for this.

435
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,500
They'd have to let you leave.

436
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,458
You're using your real name.

437
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,250
The decision is all yours.

438
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,416
All I want

439
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,958
is to keep on acting.

440
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,416
I joined this show for exposure

441
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,083
so I'd be offered more diverse roles.

442
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,333
That's why…

443
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,625
I can't possibly drop out now.

444
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,208
Okay, then.

445
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:47,791
But it doesn't feel right
to continue as usual.

446
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,416
Not with all those online trolls,
and the show permitting it.

447
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,916
It really ticks me off.

448
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,833
From here on out, let's make this
a true reality show.

449
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,250
ACTRESS MINOR ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
AMID ONLINE ABUSE

450
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,500
Who could've leaked this information?

451
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,750
Word from above?

452
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,083
They want us to clamp down more on set.

453
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Actually, I just talked to Aqua.

454
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:26,625
He wants to borrow some fixed rig footage.

455
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:28,500
Aqua Hoshino?

456
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,583
I believe a camera caught
Yuki and Akane making up.

457
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,750
I want that footage.

458
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,458
I can't give you that.

459
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:44,416
Is that because you told her
to play the villain to get noticed?

460
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,083
We don't order anything.

461
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
She was free at any time

462
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,583
to have it not aired.

463
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,791
Akane feels a responsibility to this show.

464
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
She'd never question your staging.

465
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,500
We make reality entertainment.

466
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,458
Akane's a pro, and so are we.

467
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,666
We all knew the stakes.

468
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,833
A pro, huh?

469
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,791
How old are you, Director?

470
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,291
-I'm 35.
-Akane's still a minor.

471
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,000
If adults don't protect her, who will?

472
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,041
Aqua has a point.

473
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,625
Let him use the footage.

474
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
-But…
-I'll take responsibility.

475
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,375
We'll need this, too.

476
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,583
Please don't.

477
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,250
I like this one.

478
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,083
Edit this part.

479
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,375
Fireworks footage.

480
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,208
Let me see.

481
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,958
-That's a great shot.
-Nice.

482
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,416
-Send me that, too.
-Okay.

483
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,750
With the world watching, here's our
chance to right a wrong.

484
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,458
What do you mean?

485
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,750
The nasty trolls out there are only
a small percentage of users.

486
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,291
The rest have yet to decide
to be critical or supportive.

487
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:34,416
They're waiting for an answer.

488
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,875
If we provide one they can
sympathize with,

489
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:43,000
we will have added some "justice"
to the world.

490
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,916
She's an influencer.

491
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,208
That's awesome.

492
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,833
Buzz doesn't just happen. You create it.

493
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:55,291
First off, they won't like slick editing.

494
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,666
Forget the effects.

495
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,916
-Like this?
-Yeah.

496
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Much better.

497
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,958
-Why don't you use my song?
-Your song?

498
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,750
-Yeah, like "Bam!"
-Bam?

499
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,000
-A big bam.
-No "Bam," please.

500
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,333
Aqua, we've finished encoding.

501
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,500
We're all ready to post this.

502
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,833
We are?

503
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:19,916
See for yourself.

504
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,333
Just let me sleep.

505
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,208
Ready?

506
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,666
Here goes.

507
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,166
Hit it!

508
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,583
Good luck, everybody!

509
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,625
Woot woot!

510
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,083
Help me.

511
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:18,166
Keep crying, your eyes will puff up.

512
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:19,958
Not attractive.

513
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,375
Smile.

514
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,666
Akane!

515
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,041
Yeah!

516
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,291
Still going strong.

517
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,208
Thanks guys!

518
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:49,583
Having fun, Akane?

519
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,833
Lots.

520
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,750
Before the flame goes out.

521
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,208
Ready, go.

522
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,208
Love for Real rules!

523
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,500
Yeah!

524
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,666
Wow!

525
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,416
-Look at it climb!
-Awesome.

526
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,791
-That's crazy.
-It's climbing.

527
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,791
Go, go, go!

528
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,750
Wow! We did it!

529
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,916
We've gone viral!

530
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THE CAST IS TIGHT!

531
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:32,625
Our video did help quell the flamers
to a certain extent.

532
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:44,208
Please welcome Akane back to the set.

533
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,958
I can't speak unequivocally

534
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,333
because the trolls will never disappear.

535
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,291
They'll be back rehashing this
at the next slip up,

536
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,250
over and over for the next 10, 20 years.

537
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:07,208
At any rate, I'm just so glad you're back.

538
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:11,666
I feel so bad for worrying everybody.

539
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:16,791
I still think you need to pad
your character on the show.

540
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:18,541
Beef up?

541
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,791
Yeah, protect your true self from harm

542
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,333
with fiction.

543
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:28,166
In life, everyone must put on an act
a little bit.

544
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Put on an act.

545
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:35,291
The question is, "What sort of role
should you play?"

546
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,333
What?

547
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,375
What's your girl type?

548
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,791
Why ask me?

549
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,750
You're the only boy around.

550
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:55,750
Your ideal woman is? 3, 2, 1!

551
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,625
A smile as bright as the sun.

552
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:05,583
What?

553
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,458
A flawless performer.

554
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,375
Angelic eyes that grab
and hold you captive.

555
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,625
That's a really high bar.

556
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:28,166
Maybe someone like B-Komachi's Ai.

557
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:30,125
Who?

558
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,833
An idol who died years ago. Am I close?

559
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,958
More than you think.

560
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,333
B-Komachi's Ai.

561
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,416
I'll give it a shot.

562
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,958
That's clearly an impossibility.

563
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Everything Ai had was God-given.

564
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,583
It can't be copied.

565
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,708
By anyone.

566
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,458
B-KOMACHI'S AI
THE REASON BEHIND HER TIME OFF

567
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,583
Eyes that beam confidence.

568
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,916
A need for self-approval?

569
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,416
Guessing from her unpredictable
words and deeds,

570
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:24,000
she may have lacked a formal education.

571
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:32,041
Is it possible her childhood was spent
in a poor home environment?

572
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,500
I wonder if this will make
Aqua's head turn.

573
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:01,875
We're rolling.

574
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:34,666
I'm back.

575
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,916
Welcome home!

576
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,666
It's about time.

577
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,791
We missed you.

578
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,875
-Welcome back.
-Really?

579
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:53,875
Nothing.

580
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,791
Sorry to keep you waiting.

581
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,250
-No kidding.
-Nice to have you back.

582
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,458
Time to have some fun.

583
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:04,875
You're looking good, Akane.
But different somehow.

584
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:05,958
You think so?

585
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,083
Is this what you wanted?

586
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:16,375
Will you hang out with me today, Aqua?

587
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,041
Wait, what is this now?

588
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,875
Is that Aqua blushing?

589
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,708
Knock it off.

590
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,041
He is. Aqua's blushing.

591
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,166
Mark the moment.

592
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,583
Hey.

593
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:03,041
What character are you trying
to create, Akane?

594
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,791
What? Why do you ask?

595
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:13,500
For a second there, you looked like Ai.

596
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,458
No way. I'm so glad.

597
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:20,250
-All my research paid off.
-Research?

598
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,833
I spent hours building up a profile of Ai.

599
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,625
Profile?

600
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,625
Secretive but prone to speaking out.

601
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,291
Detached but also committed.

602
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:39,916
In short, she was capable of holding
opposite traits at once.

603
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:43,666
But then something changed.

604
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:48,125
Her erratic and iconoclastic
behavior softened.

605
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,375
She must've met someone special.

606
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,958
Given her age, maybe a first crush.

607
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,833
She then took a break from showbiz.

608
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:06,541
When she returned, it's like her mind
had stabilized.

609
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:11,166
It's as if she had learned
to embrace the world.

610
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:15,875
Almost like a maternal instinct.

611
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:20,458
Maybe she'd given birth
secretly to a child.

612
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,916
Maybe somewhere her child
is alive and well.

613
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:32,583
Of course, this is all purely conjecture.

614
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:49,166
I spent years living with Ai.

615
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:53,583
And yet I didn't know
the first thing about her.

616
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,458
I never knew who she was.

617
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,166
Like where the lies ended

618
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,250
and the truth began.

619
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,291
I still don't know

620
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,625
what she means to me.

621
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,333
-Morning!
-Morning!

622
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,166
-Did you see Love for Real?
-Of course.

623
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:21,000
What's up with Aqua?

624
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:25,041
He and Akane seem strengthened
by all the trouble.

625
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,791
There's chemistry.

626
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:31,291
It's electric.
Do you think they'll kiss at the end?

627
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,916
God, I hope so. I can't wait!

628
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,291
Wanna play hooky with me?

629
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,583
You bet.

630
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:12,083
A young man springs a young girl
from prison to play catch?

631
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,375
I knew you were weird.

632
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:19,958
Am I?

633
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,666
So what's up with Love for Real?

634
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,250
How do you mean?

635
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,583
Like the ending couple.

636
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,208
And their kiss.

637
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,625
Do you care?

638
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,208
Of course I don't.

639
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,250
But…

640
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,208
is there a type you like?

641
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,500
I've been thinking a lot lately

642
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,500
about how the human mind

643
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,291
can change a lot with physical growth.

644
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,625
How our minds and bodies

645
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,833
conform to their environment.

646
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,666
I feel like

647
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,791
Aqua and I have at last merged into one.

648
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:38,500
I've been meaning to ask

649
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,791
but was too scared to.

650
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,125
Are you…

651
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,875
by chance…

652
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,750
still in puberty?

653
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,333
That was so fast!

654
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,500
You caught it.

655
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,666
Have some self-control.

656
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,791
You've done this before.

657
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,041
My first time with you.

658
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:21,166
Good morning.

659
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,375
Morning.

660
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,458
-Morning.
-Good morning.

661
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,000
-Morning.
-Good morning.

662
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:30,375
Welcome to the last day of shooting,
and climactic confessional.

663
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:33,416
Let's make it sizzle. Good luck!

664
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:34,958
Good luck.

665
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,541
I realized I knew almost nothing

666
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,541
about what fueled the heart and mind

667
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,375
of Ai Hoshino.

668
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,708
That free-spirited talent

669
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:49,208
confounded me.

670
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:54,208
But in just a few days, Akane Kurokawa

671
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:58,583
had analyzed Ai in great detail,

672
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:02,208
tracing both her behavior and motivation.

673
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:06,833
Camera's rolling.

674
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,291
Hey Akane?

675
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,958
Check it out.

676
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:58,833
I can use Akane Kurokawa

677
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,333
to help me find the truth.

678
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,291
I won't let her out of my sight.

679
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:14,166
AQUA AND AKANE A MATCH

680
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,541
You idiot.

681
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:41,208
LALA LAI THEATRICAL COMPANY

682
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,500
And action.
