1
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,958
Oh my God!

2
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,708
Anemone's creativity is on fire here.

3
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,750
I really didn't expect quality like this.

4
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,083
She's a helluva creator.

5
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,166
When are you posting it?

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,250
I planned to do it tomorrow.

7
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,708
But I think I need time to strategize.

8
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,083
Strategize?

9
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,416
Yeah, prepare the buzz machine.

10
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:02,041
Buzz doesn't just happen. You create it.

11
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:09,166
Aqua, come see our music video.
It'll blow your mind.

12
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,416
You've got to see this.
Anemone is awesome.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,958
I will later.

14
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,083
-What?
-What? No. Come watch it with us.

15
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
-This part is so cute!
-What's his problem?

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,916
He really ticks me off.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I'm around, he hides in his room.

18
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,541
You're imagining things.

19
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,916
He's trying to be mindful of Akane.

20
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,291
What?

21
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,833
Did you resolve things with her?

22
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,250
Yeah.

23
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,166
We decided to date for real.

24
00:01:55,875 --> 00:02:01,000
Fine, whatever. It's not my business
who he goes out with.

25
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,875
But…

26
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,041
does he have to avoid me?

27
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,583
It hurts my feelings.

28
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,416
Kana, don't cry.

29
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,041
I'm not.

30
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,375
It's Mem.

31
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,333
Come in.

32
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,416
Can we talk?

33
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,791
What can I do for you?

34
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,083
I want to ask you to stop avoiding Kana.

35
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,791
Lately, you've been acting kind of,
well, immature.

36
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,750
I need to put some…

37
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,333
distance between us.

38
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:19,000
Why? You can still reassure Akane
without alienating Kana that much.

39
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,708
You owe that much to both.

40
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,708
Arima's star is rising.

41
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,000
And it'll only continue.

42
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,375
But if there's even a hint of a man…

43
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,083
what will happen?

44
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,958
Like tabloid photos.

45
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,416
Or an online leak.

46
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,333
A crazed fan might snap, and harm her.

47
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,708
If that were to happen,
I simply couldn't handle it.

48
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,750
Could it be that Aqua's fallen hard
for Kana?

49
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,750
One week later.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:01,291
Pizza!

51
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,458
ORDERED EVERY PIZZA FLAVOR. IF WE EAT
THEM ALL, WE'LL SHOW YOU OUR MUSIC VIDEO!

52
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,416
You can do it, Mem-cho.

53
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,541
B-Komachi's first music video
went on YouTube.

54
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,833
CHANNEL DASHBOARD
UPLOAD MUSIC VIDEO "TWILIGHT"

55
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,166
It quickly went viral.

56
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,083
Ruby's slightly dark and mysterious vibe,
in particular,

57
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,916
gained attention.

58
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,458
B-Komachi's name recognition rose.

59
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,666
"TWILIGHT" BY B-KOMACHI
OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO

60
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,541
When the video's views were tallied up,

61
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,166
they totaled over 20 million.

62
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,958
DEBUT SINGLE "TWILIGHT."
THE RETURN OF B-KOMACHI!

63
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,833
-Ruby-chan!
-Love you, Ruby!

64
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,208
B-KOMACHI MEET AND GREET
NEW SINGLE: "TWILIGHT!"

65
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,125
One could sense

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,541
that B-Komachi was on the verge
of breaking out big.

67
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,208
"TWILIGHT"

68
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,958
Finished at last.

69
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm absolutely starving.

70
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,541
Let's go out for ramen.

71
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll pass.

72
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,500
What? Party pooper.

73
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,541
I'm going home. See you later.

74
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,625
See ya.

75
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
How about you, Ruby?

76
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,916
I'm gonna pass, too. Good night.

77
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:26,166
Let's move on to our next topic.

78
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,375
Foods I can't eat.

79
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:33,458
Something has gotten into
Kana and Ruby lately.

80
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,916
How so?

81
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,208
Well, in Kana's case…

82
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,375
she seems vaguely impatient
about something.

83
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:49,916
And Ruby seems to have lost
her bottomless cheerfulness.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,208
What about you, Aqua?

85
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,541
An animal I don't like?

86
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,750
It's dogs.

87
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,166
-Aqua has changed a lot, too.
-What? Dogs? That's rare.

88
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,125
People change with each day.

89
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,541
DIGGING DOG'S ONE CHANCE

90
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,041
HIS LEAST FAVORITE ANIMAL
WILL SURPRISE YOU

91
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,541
Hey! What are you doing?

92
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,875
How dare you?

93
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,791
-RUBY SHOULD BE CENTER.
-I LOVE RUBY.

94
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,375
KANA ISN'T CENTER MATERIAL

95
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,875
THE CHILD ACTRESS KANA LOOKS LIKE THIS NOW

96
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,875
I knew this would happen.

97
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,416
All right.

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,958
DIGGING DOG'S ONE CHANCE

99
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,125
Aqua.

100
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,041
Were you…

101
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,958
waiting long?

102
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,125
No, not long.

103
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,666
Good, I'm glad.

104
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,583
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

105
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,666
Thanks for making time. You must be busy.

106
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,166
I think that's my line.

107
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,958
I figured once my shoot starts,
it'll be hard to see each other.

108
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,083
When does filming begin?

109
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,666
Next week.

110
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,541
We're doing readings now,
but it's hard work.

111
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,791
Director Kindaichi, right?

112
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,541
Your personality has really changed, Aqua.

113
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
It has?

114
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,250
You're more positive than when we met.

115
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,458
I've done a lot of thinking lately.

116
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,416
About life's meaning.

117
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,291
Why was I born?
What is my purpose in this life?

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,541
I ultimately came to the realization
that there is none.

119
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,583
People are born, they live,
and then they die.

120
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
So we must live in the moment.

121
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,416
I agree.

122
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,416
I wanted to find the man
who drove my mom to her death.

123
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,875
Me and Ruby's father.

124
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:06,958
I saw taking personal revenge on him
as my life mission.

125
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:18,125
But this year,
I finally met one of my half-siblings.

126
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:24,666
It turns out our father was a struggling
and married actor,

127
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,666
who committed suicide with an ex-actress.

128
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,083
An ex-actress and a struggling actor?

129
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,666
It doesn't matter. It's all over now.

130
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,583
That's good.

131
00:11:54,791 --> 00:12:00,250
I once heard that Mr. Himekawa's
parents died of a double suicide.

132
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,166
AIRI HIMEKAWA, SPOUSE, SUICIDE

133
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,791
His mother, Airi,
was a marquee actress at Lala Lai.

134
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,041
I believe his father, too, was an actor.

135
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,708
Aqua learned of his half-sibling
only this year.

136
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,708
It aligns with his meeting Mr. Himekawa.

137
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,541
AIRI HIMEKAWA, SEIJURO UEHARA

138
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,083
I knew it.

139
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,208
A LOCAL TRAGEDY

140
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,291
9/16/2011 THEME : SADDEST DAY EVER

141
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,125
Yes.

142
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,166
On the 16th?

143
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,625
Understood. Thank you.

144
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,166
I'll confirm her schedule
and get back to you.

145
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,041
Understood.

146
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,208
Thank you.

147
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,750
What's with all the calls?

148
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,625
We're getting flooded with work for Ruby.

149
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,083
Not for B-Komachi?

150
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,833
No, just Ruby.

151
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:22,291
But none of it is work
an upstart idol could do.

152
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,291
It's as if someone's pulling the strings.

153
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,416
Digging Dog's One Chance!

154
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:39,083
Welcome to another edition of
Digging Dog's One Chance.

155
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,583
This week's Digging Dog question.

156
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:49,333
Has anyone actually named their child
Pikachu, and does that person exist?

157
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,916
For that, we turn to our newest reporter.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,125
Who?

159
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,500
THE SEARCH FOR PIKACHU

160
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,750
Hello! Your appointed Digging Dog
reporter today is Aqua's twin sister,

161
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,208
me, Ruby Hoshino!

162
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,083
Hey there, Big Brother.

163
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,625
No way.

164
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,458
What do you think of my appearance?

165
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,291
-You're getting it at home.
-No way, no way.

166
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,916
Now, be nice.

167
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,166
Please take a seat for now.

168
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,208
Does the rumored Pikachu actually exist?

169
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,666
And if so, where?

170
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,541
That's what I'm here to find out.

171
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,791
So let's unleash the Digging Dog!

172
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,291
Adorable.

173
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,875
There you have it.
Our big surprise was for Aqua.

174
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,125
What a darling sister.

175
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,291
What was that, Mr. Kaburagi?

176
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,458
-I'm afraid I can't take credit for that.
-Then?

177
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,750
It was your sister herself.

178
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,083
Ruby did it?

179
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,625
She sent a well-written proposal.

180
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,041
Someone must've put her up to it.

181
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,291
What's the big idea?

182
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,083
Sorry?

183
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,625
Going directly to Kaburagi with work.

184
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,666
-Hey, it helped the show. A win-win.
-At whose suggestion?

185
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,583
I thought of it all myself.

186
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,541
I find that hard to believe.

187
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,333
It's like you're pressing.

188
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:42,041
Why are you selling yourself
cheaply like that?

189
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,083
Didn't you want to be a straight-up,
beautiful idol?

190
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,250
Be serious, Big Bro.

191
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:57,250
Can anyone be a straight-up
beautiful idol in this industry?

192
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,416
Ruby!

193
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,416
Ruby…

194
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,291
I love you.

195
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,625
I have to make it big in this business.

196
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,750
Otherwise I won't be able to draw out

197
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,500
the creep who killed Mama and Doc.

198
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:46,083
Deep down,
I think Aqua hoped to end his vendetta.

199
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,083
That's why he overlooked
something so obvious.

200
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,416
DO NOT REMOVE

201
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,916
LALA LAI (MEMBER LIST)

202
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,250
You're the one who's whispering
in Ruby's ear.

203
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,125
Am I right, Mr. Saitoh?

204
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,583
How'd you find me?

205
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,750
I keep close tabs on people who knew Ai.

206
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,166
You've always been observant.

207
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,833
Do you miss producing idols?

208
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,375
Or is this a feeble attempt

209
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,625
to atone for Ai's death and
vanishing on your wife?

210
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,833
Why all the secrecy?

211
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,541
I've got my own agenda.
I can't involve Miyako.

212
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,541
Your agenda?

213
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,333
You of all should get it.

214
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,708
I intend to kill him…
the person who did that to Ai.

215
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,208
You may have lost your beloved mother.

216
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,333
But I felt like I lost a daughter.

217
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:30,083
I chose to enter show business
for the very same reason.

218
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,083
But I have news for you.

219
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,125
The man who killed Ai is dead.

220
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,333
I found a guy with my father's DNA.

221
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,791
My father was Seijuro Uehara.

222
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,083
A failed actor…

223
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,458
who took his own life.

224
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,458
Our vendetta has long been over.

225
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,583
-That's why…
-Don't be naïve.

226
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,875
I know about that incident, too.

227
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:18,333
The Uehara double suicide was famous
within the industry.

228
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,708
But that happened…

229
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,333
prior to B-Komachi securing
the Tokyo Dome concert.

230
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:30,666
In other words, Uehara died before
Ai moved to her new home.

231
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,625
How could a dead person

232
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,333
know her new address?

233
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,500
But DNA testing…

234
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,625
Could the mother have had another man?

235
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:50,125
Maybe Uehara found out
and it drove him to suicide.

236
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,750
You used to be a sharp little kid.

237
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:59,375
You should've been able to make
that assumption pretty easily.

238
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,416
What's wrong?

239
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,666
You are.

240
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,083
Your story doesn't add up.

241
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,375
Think about it!

242
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,916
Your story can't possibly be right!

243
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,791
It can't be. It can't be.

244
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,416
No, it can't be true!
It's all done. It has to be!

245
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,083
It's supposed to be all over.

246
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,208
I'm sorry. My bad.

247
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:43,125
All of this is just my own,
biased speculation.

248
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,708
Leave the rest to me.

249
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,416
Put your mind at ease. Okay?

250
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,708
If Mr. Himekawa was not Uehara's
biological son,

251
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,041
then who's his and Aqua's real father?

252
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:41,416
It's likely to be a former Lala Lai
member that both mothers knew.

253
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,750
That's an easy favor.

254
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,833
If you leave this world,
I'll pray you go to heaven

255
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,458
whether you take on God or the Devil.

256
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,875
Now then…

257
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,250
VIDEO TAPE IS JAMMED AND CAN'T BE USED

258
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,708
If you leave this world,

259
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,708
I'll pray you go to heaven.

260
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,833
The resemblance.

261
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't care if they are God or the Devil.

262
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,708
Hey.

263
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,375
Do you see that star?

264
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,708
HIKARU KAMIKI

265
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,041
Yes, I do. It's the first star.

266
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,208
That star is…

267
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,333
HIKARU KAMIKI

268
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,000
When Ai was pregnant,

269
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,166
he was in middle school?

270
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,291
I'll pray to your god

271
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,000
to grant your wish.

272
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,000
The truth is you know

273
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,625
why you were reborn and…

274
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,208
what you must do.

275
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:18,583
This time for sure,
you will find the man who killed Ai

276
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,791
and take revenge yourself.

277
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,833
I think you should suffer.

278
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:34,458
You just sat there and watched her die.

279
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,916
This is your punishment.

280
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,250
-Your just reward.
-No.

281
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:45,375
I mean… I can lead a happy, normal life.

282
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,583
This little respite of yours
is but a daydream.

283
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,791
Just forget it all.

284
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,041
Forget that we haven't finished
a single thing.

285
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,000
Forget the revenge.
Forget the pain of Ai's love.

286
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,375
Forget how you failed her.

287
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,000
Shut up!

288
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,583
Did I…

289
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:26,291
do something to warrant such hatred?

290
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,500
Arima.

291
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:39,250
I'm not very smart,
so forgive me for not realizing sooner.

292
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:30,000
TWILIGHT

293
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,500
I wonder…

294
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:36,166
why I'm trying to be an idol.

295
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,416
I can't possibly be his fave…

296
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:46,375
if he hates me so much.
It doesn't make sense.

297
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,208
I'm so stupid.

298
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,083
I'M EATING IN ROPPONGI. - MAKO AZAMI

299
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,500
CARE TO JOIN?

300
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:18,000
Wow, Mako, you look so different.

301
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,541
Really? Take a seat.

302
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,958
-Hi, I'm Kana Arima.
-I knew it!

303
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,833
-From B-Komachi!
-Yes.

304
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:28,541
-And Tokyo Blade.
-Thank you.

305
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:31,291
-Mako, you were in it too.
-Yeah. We're co-stars.

306
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,541
You've…

307
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:37,041
become so sparkly.

308
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,708
You haven't changed at all.

309
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:50,375
Listen… I didn't expect a place like this.

310
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,333
What do you mean? This is normal.

311
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,166
Here.

312
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,875
I'm a minor. I'll have tea.

313
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:02,416
Come on. It's been a while.
Let's tie one on.

314
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,250
I'll take that.

315
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,166
Mr. Shima!

316
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,375
-Hilarious. He chugged it!
-Down the hatch!

317
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,541
So manly!

318
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:12,875
May I sit?

319
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,500
Know Masanori Shima?
He directed Burning Body Fluids.

320
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,500
Of course. I've seen all your work.

321
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:27,416
They're all wonderful.

322
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,875
I'm honored to hear that from you.

323
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,291
Way to go, Director. You've got a fan.

324
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,375
Mako!

325
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,125
Hey, long time no see!

326
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,541
Excuse me.

327
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:42,375
-Long time no see.
-I know.

328
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,541
What's your poison?

329
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,375
-Let's drink.
-Yeah, let's drink!

330
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,250
-Okay, cheers.
-Cheers!

331
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,541
Drink up.

332
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,750
Career length?

333
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,500
Over 16 years in showbiz.

334
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,708
You're active as an idol, too, right?

335
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:03,916
Yes.

336
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,083
I saw your music video.
B-Komachi's got momentum.

337
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,416
I'm just…

338
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,125
an accessory to Ruby.

339
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,708
I highly doubt that.

340
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,875
No, I really am just an accessory.

341
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,458
I've got nothing.

342
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,750
That's not true.

343
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:38,041
Everybody in the biz knows
you've got talent.

344
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,833
They just can't pull it out.

345
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,583
Thank you.

346
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:53,083
Would you be interested in reading
a rough draft of my next film?

347
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,083
Would I? Yes, I'd love to.

348
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,125
My office is nearby. Can you stop by?

349
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,958
Okay.

350
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,250
Cheers.

351
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,333
This tastes great.

352
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,375
You said your office…

353
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:31,625
Third floor.

354
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,041
Then, I'll wait here.

355
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,000
Hello?

356
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,500
Staying up late…

357
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,291
will ruin your skin.

358
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,583
Well, you called me so look who's talking?

359
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,083
Aqua?

360
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,208
Ever since

361
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:53,541
I met you, Akane…

362
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:56,333
I've felt like a new person.

363
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,250
You gave me affirmation,

364
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,583
stood by me,

365
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,583
told me when I was wrong.

366
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,583
I didn't want to let go

367
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:22,291
of the times I've spent with you.

368
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,833
So I'm asking…

369
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,916
what do I do?

370
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,500
Could you decide for me, Akane?

371
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,250
Is it okay to forget everything

372
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,375
and just be happy?

373
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,125
Or do I…

374
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,375
This is a decision you must make yourself.

375
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,291
You don't belong to me.

376
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,250
And I don't belong to you.

377
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:07,791
We're two compatible, independent
adults who can augment each other.

378
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:13,916
Anything less would be co-dependency.

379
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:21,291
You don't have to worry about anything
ever again.

380
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:28,833
When it's all over,
maybe we can start dating once more.

381
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,625
Good night.

382
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:04,791
It took a bit of time,
but I finally found it.

383
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:19,125
The world is full of injustices
that the law can’t adjudicate.

384
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:24,333
So people take matters
into their own hands.

385
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:30,791
HIKARU KAMIKI

386
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:38,041
I am aware that you tried to use me.

387
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,208
But that's okay.

388
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:45,166
You came to save me that day.

389
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,125
So it's my turn to save you from

390
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,625
your burden of revenge.

391
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,500
I won't let anybody come in our way.

392
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,666
Very soon, it will all be over.

393
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,666
And then we'll be able to enjoy
a nice meal,

394
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,541
take a vacation somewhere.

395
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,333
We'll be together

396
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,833
from here on out.

397
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,583
Aqua?

398
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,916
Don't be stupid.

399
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,416
But how?

400
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,708
How'd you find me here?

401
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,291
What do you think I'm doing?

402
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,666
It's as if you knew what
I was going to do.

403
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,958
You're too perceptive.

404
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:58,750
I've spent the past few days tailing you.

405
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,125
A GPS tracker?

406
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,541
Aqua, no.

407
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,875
This crosses a line.

408
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,375
You can't do things like this.

409
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:24,916
It shows a lack of respect
for me as a person.

410
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,875
If you'd asked me,
I'd have worn hundreds of them for you.

411
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,208
I was willing to help.

412
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,833
I felt you'd get information.

413
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,250
And you did.

414
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,125
You planned to meet him.

415
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,958
My father.

416
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,000
With a knife.

417
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,208
What did you have in mind?

418
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,541
Stay out of my life.

419
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,958
And I promise to stay out of yours.

420
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,250
Why?

421
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:22,083
All you had to do was ask,
and I would've followed you to Hell.

422
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,666
If I'm going to Hell…

423
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,916
I go alone.

424
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:34,916
Fine.

425
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,541
But one thing I know for sure.

426
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:46,625
You've chosen the wrong path, Aqua.

427
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,041
I'm aware of that.

428
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,083
Damn it. I couldn't save you.

429
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:11,291
How I wish I could have.

430
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:26,958
Pardon me.

431
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,541
Kana Arima, right?

432
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,041
How do you do?

433
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:39,375
I'm Itano with
Weekly ShowBiz Scoop magazine.

434
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,541
How can I help you?

435
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,625
Is this you with film director
Masanori Shima?

436
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,500
Can I ask you about your relationship?

437
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,583
Ms. Arima?

438
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,500
Ow… pain.

439
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,000
You're stiff, Mem-cho.

440
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,958
I'm in real pain. Okay, then show me.

441
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,166
Glad to.

442
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,375
What? No way. That's good!

443
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,083
-Right?
-Awesome.

444
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,750
Is Kana here?

445
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,916
I'm screwed.

446
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm screwed.

447
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,875
I'm so screwed. What do I do?

448
00:39:47,041 --> 00:39:48,333
KANA ARIMA TRYST?

449
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:49,708
DRINKS WITH DIRECTOR

450
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:51,208
FIRST SCANDAL

451
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,541
Any word?

452
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,708
She may not come back.

453
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:10,125
She's not that weak.

454
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:14,791
At 18, she's not as strong
as you give her credit for.

455
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:21,250
This industry thrives on crushing
children's hearts and souls.

456
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,500
I'll try going to her house.

457
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:30,083
You all look where you can.

458
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,333
I'm coming with you.

459
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:50,333
I think the only person who can
save Kana now is you, Aqua.

460
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:59,833
She struggles with being an idol
but has stuck with it.

461
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,000
And you're the reason.

462
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:07,041
It's because you asked her to join

463
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,875
that she believed in the possibility.

464
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,041
She became an idol because you wanted it.

465
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,791
It's you who drew her into this world.

466
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,875
You need to talk to her,
even if it's just a little.

467
00:41:36,791 --> 00:41:40,875
It was stupidly reckless behavior.

468
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,708
Listen…

469
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,166
it's pretty late. I think I'll be going.

470
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,791
Stay the night.

471
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,125
I'm sorry.

472
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,416
But I'm…

473
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,125
in love with someone.

474
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,333
I have no idea

475
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,583
the trouble this will cause everyone.

476
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,708
I could've told you from the start

477
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,250
that I wasn't made to be an idol.

478
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,083
I have a surly tongue and personality.

479
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:58,916
I bitch and moan about
not getting roles I want.

480
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,958
I'm so far removed

481
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,000
from the ideal image people are seeking.

482
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,750
With me, what you see is what you get.
Nobody wants that.

483
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,750
I don't belong.

484
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,083
I don't belong.

485
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,583
I don't belong.

486
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,083
I don't belong.

487
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:34,875
I don't belong.

488
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,625
Help me…

489
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,250
Aqua.

490
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,125
What did I just say?

491
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,708
Was I about to lean on a man
'cause I'm struggling?

492
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:21,750
That's so lame.
Playing the tragic heroine now, huh?

493
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,791
Lame, lame. Seriously lame.

494
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:27,000
Lame me from Lametown.

495
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,125
Lametown?

496
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,250
I'm sure they'll all call me
a bitch or slut or bitch-slut.

497
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,958
Go have a field day with it!

498
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:43,208
I've heard every insult
since I could walk.

499
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:46,125
I hate squeaky-clean, anyway.

500
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:48,958
The public can kiss my ass!

501
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,166
The public…

502
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:55,875
has never even once stepped in
to cover for me.

503
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,958
But who cares?

504
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,375
I will persevere.

505
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,166
I will stay true to myself and survive.

506
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:10,166
Don't believe me? Just watch!

507
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:14,958
How long…

508
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,375
have you been there?

509
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,625
Let's go home.

510
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:39,666
What will become of senpai?

511
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,416
Say Ruby?

512
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,375
What?

513
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,125
What are Arima and Mem to you?

514
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:03,958
They're important friends
who've fought with me.

515
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:11,000
If there were a way to rescue Arima,
would you want to?

516
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,875
-Of course.
-But what if…

517
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:18,041
it was a choice that came with
some pain for you?

518
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,000
We've come too far

519
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,875
to be crushed underfoot now.

520
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,666
The work from here

521
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,375

There is new evidence in
the 12-year-old murder case of

524
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,916
ex B-Komachi idol, Ai Hoshino.

525
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:58,000
According to
Weekly ShowBiz Scoop magazine,

526
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,000
the motive for the murder by a rabid fan

527
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:06,666
was when he found out that Ai
had secretly given birth to twins.

528
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,291
Those twins, actor and entertainer,
Aqua Hoshino,

529
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:16,125
and new B-Komachi member, Ruby Hoshino,

530

just responded to press questions.

Is Ai really your mom?

Is the article true?

533
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,125
You're her real twins?

534
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:30,041
Everything that was reported
in the magazine article is true.

541
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,291
they ditched the Arima scoop.

542
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:02,458
You just revealed the secret
Mama died protecting.

543
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,833
Was it worth all that?

544
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,041
What would Mama in heaven think?

545
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:15,041
To be betrayed by her own son like this.

546
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:22,375
She'd go, "Oopsy,
the cat's finally out of the bag."

547
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,791
And then giggle.

548
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,916
Ai is dead.

549
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:38,000
We should use this information
to help the living.

550
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,458
The Aqua I'd known till now

551
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:45,625
always put Ai above all else,

552
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:49,125
regardless of place and time.

553
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,875
But Mama now seems little more
than a tool to you.

554
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,666
What changed you?

555
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,958
-You're wrong.
-Liar!

556
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,083
-Listen Ruby.
-Don't touch me!

557
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:09,958
I no longer consider you family, got it?

558
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,875
So long, Big Bro.

559
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:37,250
Please record the real me.

560
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,166
At last…

561
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:46,166
I can keep my promise to you.

562
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,541

564

Hikaru.

565
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:12,791
I'm taking my revenge on you in the most…

566
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,291
painful way possible.
