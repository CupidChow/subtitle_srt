1
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,708
This story is a work of fiction.

2
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,541
Actually, most things in this world

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,333
are fiction.

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,500
We fabricate...

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,291
exaggerate...

6
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,291
and neatly hide inconvenient truths.

7
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,708
If you're gonna lie, you must do it well.

8
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,708
Idol fans want that from you.

9
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,541
That's idol group B-Komachi's ace...

10
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,000
owning center stage.

11
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,958
That's Ai.

12
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,125
She is my greatest fave.

13
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,708
B-Komachi!

14
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,500
B-Komachi!

15
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,125
I love every one of you!

16
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,500
In this world,

17
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,416
lies are a weapon.

18
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:47,500
B-Komachi rocks! Viewers should
have to pay 100 million yen for this.

19
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:50,583
Ai is simply too cute for words.

20
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,833
That quick turn is to die for!
I'm gonna pee myself.

21
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,041
Thank God for diapers. Seriously.

22
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,416
Why can't we see her live?

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,333
Because we're infants, silly.

24
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,500
Then when will be old enough to go?

25
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,291
Probably not till after preschool.

26
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,625
Her looks, style, singing, dancing
all kick butt.

27
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:17,750
Our mama is seriously awesome!
So cute I wanna cry!

28
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,625
Hey, keep it down.

29
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,833
What're you two babbling about?

30
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,833
What a babysitter's dream.

31
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,750
Concert videos of Ai
keep you quiet all day.

32
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,708
Your mom will be home soon.

33
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:53,583
Why do I get the feeling
you understand every word I say?

34
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,041
Those twins...

35
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,250
ICHIGO PRODUCTION MANAGER
MIYAKO SAITOH

36
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,708
...they've struck me
as odd from the start.

37
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,625
They behave like grown-ups.

38
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,958
It's like they whisper to each other.

39
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:16,375
I don't think they're so much "gifted,"
as just different.

40
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,916
Like they're being directed by God.

41
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,625
What about Ai?

42
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:33,916
Ai was always the same
irrepressibly bubbly self 24/7.

43
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,083
But...

44
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,916
it's hard to describe.

45
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,333
She's absent-minded but in total control.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,791
You really wouldn't believe

47
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,333
the things she's told me.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,666
Seriously. Those are weird little twins.

49
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:02,375
We've no idea why, but somehow
we've been reborn.

50
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,916
With past life memory.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,666
I'm home, Aqua! Ruby!

52
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,708
Were you angels again today?

53
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,583
Our fave idol is our mom.

54
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,708
We've been reincarnated
as the kids of our fave.

55
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,750
What's wrong? Are you okay, Aqua?

56
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:28,041
What's the matter? There there, Aqua.

57
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,166
That's Ruby.

58
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,583
Oh, you're right.

59
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,208
-Welcome home.
-Hey.

60
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,500
You can't tell your twins apart?

61
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,666
I've always been bad with names and faces.

62
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,791
Ruby doesn't mind.

63
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,791
I'm in paradise!

64
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,166
Your turn, Aqua.

65
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't believe I get to spend
every day with my fave.

66
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,083
This is heaven on earth.

67
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,458
-Say, Mr. President?
-Yeah?

68
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,208
Can I bring my twins to set tomorrow?

69
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,666
What? Don't be stupid. Of course not.

70
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
Please.

71
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,208
You are an idol.

72
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,750
Plus a minor and single mother.
If the world finds out...

73
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,875
you're finished. And so am I.

74
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,791
Oh, poop.

75
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,416
The things you say. Unbelievable.

76
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,500
-What? You wanna see this?
-It's mommy!

77
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,375
That's your mama, Ruby.

78
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,333
Ai's decision.

79
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,041
I'll keep them a secret.

80
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,666
I can find happiness...

81
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,208
as an idol and a mother.

82
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,791
I'm going to have both.

83
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,125
Ai Hoshino wants to have it all.

84
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,125
True to her word...

85
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,708
-Ai became…
-Open up.

86
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:56,833
Yummy, huh?

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,500
...a mother of twins.

88
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,041
Live in five!

89
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,583
And leader of an idol group.

90
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,958
She skyrocketed to stardom.

91
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:11,708
B-Komachi was at the center
of an idol group boom

92
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,250
from where they soon held
all of Japan captive.

93
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:21,750
Meanwhile, Ai kept hidden
the fact she'd given birth.

94
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,750
She smiled adorably at the world

95
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,833
and lied to its face.

96
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,375
Some lies come from a place of love.

97
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,166
But as to the question
of who our father was,

98
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,000
only Ai knew the answer.

99
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,125
You know someone's special...

100
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,583
DIRECTOR AND SCREENWRITER
TAISHI GOTANDA

101
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
...the moment they enter a room.

102
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,208
A FIFTEEN-YEAR LIE

103
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,708
Thank you.

104
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,208
Next person, please.

105
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,375
That's me.

106
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,458
AUDITION ROOM

107
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,250
Please introduce yourself.

108
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm Ai of B-Komachi
with Ichigo Production.

109
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,083
Come to think of it...

110
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,750
I was among the few adults

111
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,583
who could extend her a helping hand.

112
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Please leave.

113
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,625
ICHIGO PRODUCTION FORMER PRESIDENT
ICHIGO SAITOH

114
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,458
I've nothing to say to you.

115
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,333
Don't bother me about Ai again.

116
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,958
On that day...

117
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,083
my life came to an end.

118
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,875
Stop! Stop the music!

119
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,333
Okay.

120
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,583
I've gotten you a new job.

121
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,833
You've been offered a movie!

122
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,333
Wow!

123
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,500
Director Gotanda, no less...

124
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,250
wrote a script just for you.

125
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,291
-Hey.
-That's my mama!

126
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,250
-Major score for a minor agency.
-Little brat.

127
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,000
-I admit it took time, but...
-Mom, you're gonna be in a movie!

128
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:35,208
all those workshops at the Lala Lai
Theatrical Company paid off.

129
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,625
Really? Hello...?

130
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
Can I get a bigger reaction?

131
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,541
Will it have overnight location shooting?

132
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,875
Hold on a sec.

133
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,375
Let me see here.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,333
Two nights, three days in Chiba.
End of next month.

135
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,833
What does that mean?

136
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,125
I love family trips!

137
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,166
Nothing beats a vacation with you two.

138
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,708
It's a film shoot, not a vacation.

139
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,625
Call it what you want.

140
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,625
If you-know-who finds out,
we're all dead. Got it?

141
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,500
Promise me you won't call yourself "mama."

142
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,291
I promise.

143
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,625
Five years since our birth.

144
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,583
The world at large knows nothing
of our existence.

145
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:40,458
Same goes for you, Aqua and Ruby.
She's "Ai", not your "mama."

146
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,583
I'm your mom taking my kids to work.

147
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,666
Yes, Mama.

148
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,708
Mama, pat my head.

149
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,333
Mama, give us spending money.

150
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,958
Do you get how serious this is?

151
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,291
-We get it.
-We get it.

152
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,458
Seriously now.

153
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:01,125
Just as before, we've continued
to act like children.

154
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,625
-The first scene...
-Miss Hoshino's on set.

155
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,375
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

156
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,708
Welcome to the first day of shooting.

157
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,750
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

158
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,833
Any butterflies?

159
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,000
Just a few.

160
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,541
Then break a leg.

161
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,958
-Thank you.
-I'll eat ten!

162
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
You're such a cutie!

163
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,666
Who's the kid?

164
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,333
Oh, she's mine.
Sorry, I'll take care of this.

165
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,458
Ruby, what are you doing? Behave yourself.

166
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,458
A manager brings her kids to set.

167
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,916
Changing times.

168
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,916
You there, young man.

169
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,250
You can watch

170
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,500
but any screaming or crying,
and I'll toss you out.

171
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,166
Of course. I'm in preschool,

172
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,125
but I do know the basics of self-restraint

173
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,708
and shall refrain from any
disruptive behavior.

174
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,458
Please favor our agency's star,
Ai Hoshino.

175
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,833
Where'd you learn to speak like that?

176
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,458
I guess from YouTube... a little.

177
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,708
Changing times.

178
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,041
I've met many precocious child actors.

179
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,416
But none so weird as you.

180
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,541
Are you interested in acting at all?

181
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,708
Oh, there you are, Aqua!

182
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,708
What are you doing?

183
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:30,625
I'm reading the script.
They want me for a bit part.

184
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,166
Serious?

185
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:36,291
In exchange, I got the director
to promise Ai...

186
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,375
the lead and a B-Komachi theme song
in a future drama.

187
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,750
No way! You're like a manager now.

188
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,250
You two!

189
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,333
Could you keep it down?

190
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:55,333
This is a professional workplace.
Go play somewhere else.

191
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,125
How do you do?

192
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm a last-minute addition to the cast.
Aqua Hoshino.

193
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,666
Unbelievable.
What's up with this director?

194
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,625
I'm dealing with amateurs.

195
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:15,791
You're the child actor who's
"high on baking soda."

196
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,958
"High in pecking order," stupid.

197
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,375
You picking a fight?

198
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,916
I don't really like this girl.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,583
She's too affected for my taste.

200
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,375
I can hear everything you say.

201
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,750
Miss Arima, we're about to reshoot.
Please stand by.

202
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,208
It's about time.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,083
Is she all set?

204
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
-Yes, she's ready.
-Nice.

205
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,916
Closing the gate.

206
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,166
Places everybody!

207
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,458
Places everyone.

208
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,666
Roll the film.

209
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,708
-Rolling!
-We're now rolling.

210
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,916
Ready...

211
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,541
action!

212
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:15,583
Welcome to Sakayu Village.
We've been waiting for you.

213
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,750
Back then, I was considered
a peerless child prodigy.

214
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,833
ACTRESS
KANA ARIMA

215
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,833
Frankly, I was traumatized by Aqua.

216
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,583
In addition to that encounter,

217
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,458
my meeting Ai at that point was big.

218
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,416
It showed me early on
I wasn't the prodigy.

219
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:40,333
But I haven't lost yet, you know.

220
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,041
I've still got a chance.

221
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,333
I'm beat!

222
00:15:55,833 --> 00:16:01,208
You're such a good actor, Aqua.
I was very impressed.

223
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,000
I didn't expect to co-star
with my boy so soon.

224
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,375
Your mama's so thrilled!

225
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:11,208
What about me? It's not fair, Aqua!

226
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,625
You, dear Ruby want to grow up
to be an idol, right?

227
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,208
Just like you, Mama.

228
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,625
Then our collab will come later.

229
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:25,041
Not fair. I want to star with you now.

230
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,541
You got it. Come here.

231
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,833
You too, Aqua.

232
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,791
There, there.

233
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,791
The two of you are going to grow up
so fast, you know.

234
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,375
I can't wait, but it'll be sad
losing my babies.

235
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,166
Don't worry.
We'll never leave your side, Mama.

236
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,000
You mean it?

237
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,500
Forever and ever together.

238
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,250
You're so sweet.

239
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,791
Even more than a mom, my greatest fave.

240
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,125
IDOL
RUBY HOSHINO

241
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,666
Yes, the time we had together was short.

242
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,416
But she filled it with so much love.

243
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,583
I had the happiest childhood.

244
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,083
I've always had difficulty showing love.

245
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,666
An idol?

246
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,791
Me? You must be joking.

247
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:44,166
You are center position material, I swear.

248
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,000
You may want to reconsider.

249
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,958
I grew up in an orphanage.

250
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,666
Is that right?

251
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,083
I'm from a single mother household.

252
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,166
I can't remember the first time
I was beaten.

253
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:05,708
When my mom was arrested
for stealing, I got sent away.

254
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,125
No kidding.

255
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,958
So you see, I was abandoned.

256
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:16,041
That's a little heavy for an idol,
don't you think?

257
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,791
That's okay.

258
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

259
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,000
It's what makes you unique.

260
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,625
Being a top idol isn't for
run-of-the-mill people.

261
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,500
It may suit you more.

262
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:36,416
But I've no memory of loving
or being loved by anyone.

263
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,250
You can't expect me
to win their love as an idol.

264
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,166
I can't love them back.

265
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
What I hear is...

266
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,541
you saying, "I really want to
love someone."

267
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,583
Love is something

268
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,833
that can start as a lie.

269
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,166
In fact, a beautiful lie
is what fans seek.

270
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,291
It's okay to say, "I love you"
even as a lie?

271
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,416
Yes.

272
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,291
The more you say it as you sing and dance,

273
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,000
the more likely that lie
may become the truth.

274
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:23,833
"A lie becomes the truth."
Those words turned me into an idol.

275
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,541
I longed to say "I love you"
and really mean it.

276
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,500
I believed a lie could turn true.

277
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,583
"I love you all!"

278
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,166
Today again, I told a lie.

279
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,000
I still had never said "I love you"
to my own children.

280
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:58,416
I feared that if I uttered the words
"I love you,"

281
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,791
I might realize that those words,
too, were a lie.

282
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,750
That was B-Komachi's "Sign of the B."

283
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,583
They make their Tokyo Dome debut tomorrow.

284
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:22,708
How exciting.

285
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,458
Members have arrived.

286
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,583
-Hello.
-Hello.

287
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,541
-Nice to see you.
-Thank you.

288
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,416
-Hello!
-Thank you.

289
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,625
-Hello!
-Hi!

290
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,208
We'll do our best.

291
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,041
-Hello!
-Hi.

292
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,666
I'm off to rehearsal.

293
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,125
-Nice to see you.
-Look forward to working with you.

294
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,750
Cheers!

295
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,083
That hits the spot!

296
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,666
We can't thank you enough

297
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,916
for renting such a nice house for us.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,250
Well B-Komachi is a huge hit
all thanks to you, Ai.

299
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,041
I knew it when I met you.

300
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,333
And finally tomorrow,

301
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,958
you'll be playing at the Tokyo Dome!

302
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:22,833
Getting one of his acts to the Dome
was his lifelong dream.

303
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,041
Is the Tokyo Dome that special?

304
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,375
Are you serious?

305
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:32,791
It's a venue unlike any other.
It's on a whole other dimension.

306
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,333
You need specialists to book a slot.

307
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,666
You have to pass a rigorous test
to prove you're worthy.

308
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,791
The Tokyo Dome

309
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,250
is a special stage reserved
for only select artists.

310
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,708
For only the anointed few!

311
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,875
I didn't know.

312
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,833
With so much attention focused on you, Ai,

313
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:00,500
-there must be no scandal.
-For the millionth time, I know.

314
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:05,041
Don't start wishing to see
these kids' father.

315
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,541
Course not.

316
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:11,333
I've trained my lips to say
only what he wants to hear.

317
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,750
The kids are growing so fast.

318
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,125
Want to meet them?

319
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,333
I'd never see him.

320
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,916
I'm the biggest liar there is.

321
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,541
Mr. President?

322
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,583
After the concert,
mama can take time off, right?

323
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,541
I suppose so.

324
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:43,500
Let's go crazy. Three straight days!

325
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,375
Hooray!

326
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:51,333
We deserve a quiet holiday spent
just between us family.

327
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:52,458
Come here.

328
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,958
When will I be able to say it?

329
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,583
That lying woman.

330
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,708
Idols can't have children.

331
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:25,000
MORNING, EVERYONE!
LET'S ROCK THE DOME TODAY.

332
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,041
Is that Miyako?

333
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,458
Coming.

334
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,916
Congrats on the Tokyo Dome.

335
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,916
How are the twins?

336
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,000
Ai?

337
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,416
Stay away!

338
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,083
No, Aqua!

339
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,166
Does it hurt?

340
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,750
You hurt me even more.

341
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,500
You!

342
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,125
I remember.

343
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,166
Ambulance!

344
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:38,791
You're an idol who has children?

345
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,666
You mock your fans.

346
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,333
I bet you laughed at us.

347
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,416
You dirty liar!

348
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,916
Send an ambulance quickly!

349
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,708
When you said, "I love you,"
it was all a lie.

350
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,875
It's true.

351
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:03,000
To make everyone happy...

352
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,791
I've told a beautiful lie.

353
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,791
But for me...

354
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,958
the lie is love.

355
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,500
Shut up.

356
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:20,500
I've tried my best, and in my own way...

357
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,791
to convey love to all my fans.

358
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:23,958
Shut up.

359
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:28,500
I truly wanted to feel love
for all of you...

360
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,541
by repeating it as I sang...

361
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,083
hoping that someday it will turn true.

362
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,416
I said "Shut up!"

363
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,166
Your name's Ryosuke, right?

364
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,666
No? Am I mistaken?

365
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,875
Sorry.

366
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:07,625
I've never been very good
at remembering names.

367
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:13,166
At a meet-and-greet...
you gave me Okinawa star sand.

368
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,041
What're you saying?

369
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,041
It made me very happy.

370
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,625
Ai!

371
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,166
It hurts.

372
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,666
-Ai!
-Mama?

373
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,916
Don't come, Ruby!

374
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,375
The ambulance is coming.

375
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:46,583
Today, we learned an important lesson.

376
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,416
That door chain is for times like these.

377
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,708
Don't talk!

378
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,625
They didn't teach that at the orphanage.

379
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,041
It's your abdominal aorta!

380
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,791
I'm so sorry, Aqua.

381
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,875
I don't think I'll make it.

382
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,791
Are you all right, Aqua?

383
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,708
You're not hurt yourself?

384
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,625
Thank God.

385
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,458
Hey Mama? Aqua?

386
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,833
What's going on in there?

387
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,750
Mama!

388
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,833
Don't come, Ruby.

389
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,708
Aqua!

390
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,458
I wonder what you'll grow up to be.

391
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:40,000
-Mama!
-Will Ruby be an idol?

392
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,208
Open the door!

393
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,041
And Aqua an actor?

394
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,625
I sure wish I could have...

395
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,250
been with you to see that.

396
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,750
Please open the door!

397
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,958
Please!

398
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:06,208
I'm sorry I couldn't be much of
a mother to you two.

399
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,291
But you know...

400
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:17,416
I'm so glad I had you both. I really am.

401
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,958
What else?

402
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,625
What was it again?

403
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:32,166
You don't have to talk.

404
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,750
Open up, please.

405
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,750
I have to say one thing.

406
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,708
Aqua...

407
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,333
Ruby...

408
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,458
I love you.

409
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:20,125
There. I finally said it.

410
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:24,875
Sorry it wasn't sooner.

411
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:31,875
It shouldn't have taken this long.

412
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,083
But just know that...

413
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,541
I meant every word.

414
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,458
It wasn't a lie.

415
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,708
Ai?

416
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,291
Ruby's fast asleep.

417
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:41,583
And so is Aqua.

418
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:51,458
I thought it a good idea
to leave a record.

419
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,916
When you two are all grown up,

420
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,125
you might enjoy watching it over a drink.

421
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,875
I'm sure my idol career will be
long over by then.

422
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,916
But maybe you'll be idols.

423
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:14,791
You're my kids after all,
so it makes sense.

424
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Whatever you do, I just hope...

425
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,208
you're happy and healthy.

426
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,458
What more could a mother wish for really?

427
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,041
Bye.

428
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,791
A national idol was stabbed
to death by a fan.

429
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:45,416
News about the killer fleeing,
and killing himself

430
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:50,291
spread like a fire around the world.

431
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:53,375
Popular idol Ai Hoshino is dead.

432
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:59,958
Police received a report of a female
stabbed in a luxury apartment.

433
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,833
Police found her collapsed
on the floor, bleeding.

434
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,791
She was rushed to the hospital,
but died soon after.

435
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,333
AI OF B-KOMACHI DEAD

436
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,041
That same night...

437
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:17,250
unseasonal snow fell on the city of Tokyo.

438
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:23,500
As if trying to cover Ai's death.

439
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,250
On that day...

440
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:31,208
our brightest star flickered out.

441
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,541
Mama told me

442
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,333
that I'd grow up to be an idol.

443
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:39,750
I wonder if I can become one.

444
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,166
What good would that do?

445
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,750
Fans are selfish.

446
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:50,000
If they learn you're seeing someone,
they turn on you violently.

447
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,166
Even so, mama sparkled like a star.

448
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:18,708
Ruby, it seemed, would eventually
get over this.

449
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:23,416
For better or for worse,
she had a pure heart.

450
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:28,208
After years of living together,
that much I knew.

451
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,250
But as for me...

452
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,083
I feel like dying again.

453
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:38,041
I couldn't bear a life without Ai.

454
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,458
This is a private funeral.

455
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,458
Where'd they all find out about it?

456
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,041
Some insider surely leaked it.

457
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,041
An insider.

458
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,125
Where is Ai Hoshino's room?

459
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:03,541
Ai's killer was the same man who
stalked her when she gave birth.

460
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:07,458
Who gave him the hospital name?

461
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,416
How'd he get our new address?

462
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,250
Someone is giving out information.

463
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,583
The kids are growing so fast.

464
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:20,458
Want to meet them?

465
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,875
Someone with inner circle access

466
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,875
but outside of the boss and his wife.

467
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,458
My new address is...

468
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,750
None other than...

469
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,958
our biological father.

470
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:43,250
I can't die just yet.

471
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,875
First I have to find him.

472
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,958
And murder him myself.

473
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,375
ACTOR
AQUA HOSHINO

474
00:36:56,458 --> 00:37:01,666
I've never played a role with
the aim of pleasing anyone.

475
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,250
I perform purely for myself.

476
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,958
Viewers are free to feel what they like.

477
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:16,041
But for me, acting is my means...

478
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,458
for revenge.
