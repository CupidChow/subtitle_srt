1
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:36,583
Mama.

2
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,250
You're doing it backwards.

3
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,833
Swing right and up.

4
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,958
Swing right and up.

5
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,250
Oh, yeah. That's right.

6
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,666
Can't goof up at the Dome.

7
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:55,458
How did you catch that, Ruby?

8
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,958
I watch all your shows on video.

9
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,875
Really? Since when?
Let's dance together, then.

10
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,625
I'll fall down.

11
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,750
You can do it. Come on.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,666
Ready and 5, 6, 7, 8, yeah!

13
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,416
And a 1, 2, 3, 4…

14
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,458
Are you okay?

15
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,208
Good.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,208
If you're scared of falling,
you'll only fall more.

17
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,958
You've just gotta dance your heart out.

18
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,666
Trust your mama.

19
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,125
Okay?

20
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,125
Here we go.

21
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,333
Here we go.

22
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,750
That was amazing!

23
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,625
So adorable!

24
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:17,750
A chip off the old block. So cute!

25
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,250
-Mama?
-Yes?

26
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,750
Do you think I can grow up to be
an idol like you?

27
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,916
I'm absolutely sure of it.

28
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,041
After all, you're my flesh and blood.

29
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,000
Shall we go again?

30
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,916
Ready and…

31
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,583
Okay!

32
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,291
Thank you.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,333
It says here you like B-Komachi.

34
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,416
Yes. I aspire to become an idol
just like Ai.

35
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,625
Don't expect to pass.

36
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,208
Why not? You got a TV drama once.

37
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,958
That was happenstance.

38
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,541
I think I aced that last audition.

39
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,708
She says for the millionth time.

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,541
Only half a million.

41
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,916
So you are keeping count.

42
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,750
-I'll never pass an audition at this rate.
-Not likely.

43
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,750
Hey, where's the encouragement?

44
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,666
It's time you gave up.

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
I've still to hear from the big one.

46
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,833
And when is that?

47
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,208
It's this week by postcard.

48
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,583
Oh.

49
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,000
Could be here now.

50
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,125
TANIZAKURA BUILDING

51
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,291
Not today.

52
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,333
SAITOH

53
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,375
Yes, my daughter applied on her own.

54
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,583
I cannot allow her to be in entertainment.

55
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,291
Yes.

56
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:39,083
My sincerest apologies
for the misunderstanding.

57
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,708
Thank you, goodbye.

58
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
Still continuing this subterfuge?

59
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,250
She'll kill you if she finds out.

60
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,791
I think you're living in denial.

61
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,958
Ruby has the right stuff to be an idol.

62
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:13,416
If "he" were still here,
Ruby would have debuted already.

63
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,291
You mean your husband.

64
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,750
He ruined the agency and vanished.

65
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,541
That's not what I meant.

66
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,250
I'm just saying he knew
how to produce an idol.

67
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,583
Well, I won't allow it.

68
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,958
Not Ruby.

69
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,833
She won't suffer the same fate as Ai.

70
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,416
Following Ai's death,
President Ichigo Saitoh

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,875
closed down his agency and ran off.

72
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,250
Ms. Saitoh raised Ruby and I as her own.

73
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:08,875
While I continued the search
for my real father.

74
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,666
Ai had a small circle of friends.

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,625
So he probably worked in entertainment.

76
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,291
Close enough to compromise Ai's privacy.

77
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,833
PRODUCER-MR. KONDO
YU SASAKI

78
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,333
REJECTION NOTICE

79
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:44,875
I can't believe I'd get rejected
across the board.

80
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,083
They seriously have no clue.

81
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,833
I was sure my main one would take me.

82
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:56,208
Let's walk Takeshita Street.
You're sure to be scouted.

83
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
Good idea. Let's go.

84
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,708
Excuse me.

85
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,458
Got a minute?

86
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,833
TADASHI TANAKA, MANAGER

87
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,208
EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT

88
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,291
WAIVER FOR MINORS

89
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,083
-What is this?
-I got scouted by the idol group, Iribu!

90
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,708
Okay, they're underground idols.

91
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,416
But it's fate.

92
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,125
Mama got scouted too, by B-Komachi.

93
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,875
That puts me and Mama on the same path.

94
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,250
Not happening.

95
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,125
Why'd you do that?

96
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,750
Scouting laws.

97
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,708
Scouting laws?

98
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,875
Dangling a pro debut to compel
signup fees, dance lessons

99
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,833
and salon visits is fraudulent.

100
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,958
That's too bad because
I don't have to pay a dime.

101
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm invited to their next gig.

102
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,000
IRIBU - READY TO EXPLODE!

103
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,041
I'm not sure if I can go though.

104
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,875
I might not be able to go.

105
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,333
I'm this way.

106
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,541
Okay. Bye then.

107
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,625
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

108
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,541
Pardon me.

109
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,250
Are you free right now?

110
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,333
You're an underground idol?

111
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,166
That's right.

112
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,375
You've got the cuteness, that's for sure.

113
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,750
I never fall for pick up lines.

114
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,666
I don't know why I…

115
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,125
I'm honored.

116
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,583
So what is it like being
an underground idol?

117
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,583
What do you mean?

118
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,916
Things like work conditions and pay.

119
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,625
You only get paid for live concerts.

120
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,000
But there's a guaranteed minimum

121
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,833
minus costume expenses and such.

122
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,666
Makeup and transportation
is out of pocket, too.

123
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:09,833
You also get a kickback per photo
at INSTAX parties.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,291
I guess I earn about 100,000 yen
a month, give or take.

125
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,791
That's brutal. Any complaints?

126
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,166
Sure, I've got plenty.

127
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,541
Like favoritism for a girl who's not cute.

128
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,583
It turns out she's dating
one of the managers.

129
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,458
Can you believe it?

130
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,500
Nobody in the group gets along.

131
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,750
So the managers are always
having to find replacements.

132
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:45,416
Management is unethical
and group relations are bad.

133
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,958
Still want to join?

134
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:54,041
There are underground idol managers
with good track records.

135
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:58,291
But most are just idol fanatics
feeding their hobby.

136
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,166
The world of idols, underground or not,

137
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,083
is a hundred times more severe
than you can possibly imagine.

138
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,458
The moment you say you are one,

139
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,083
you lose your ordinary girlhood.

140
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:25,208
You're criminally underpaid and
constantly under a microscope.

141
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,750
Not to mention,

142
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,041
stalkers come with the job.

143
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,958
It's misery for idols who aren't popular.

144
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't you think I know that?

145
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,041
Even so, I want to be an idol.

146
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,333
I promised Mama I'd be like her!

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,125
You're serious.

148
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,000
That's what I've been saying.

149
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:00,291
This body allows me to dance freely.

150
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
In that case,

151
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,666
you must sign with us.

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,416
I will revive Ichigo Production
as its president.

153
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,333
This is so nostalgic.

154
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,541
I never thought I'd use this room again.

155
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
It's heavy.

156
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,333
We did it.

157
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,708
I'm beat.

158
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,791
Me too.

159
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,791
Are you sure?

160
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,166
After working so hard to block her?

161
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,250
It's better that she get managed by family

162
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,833
than leave her fate to strangers.

163
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
No arguing with that.

164
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,375
So that puts you both in showbiz.

165
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,500
Not both. I quit acting long ago.

166
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,208
You keep saying that.

167
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,583
Admit it, Aqua.

168
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,541
Being a stagehand sucks.

169
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,375
You want to act.

170
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,916
It's written all over your face.

171
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,083
I lack the talent.

172
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,541
No, you don't.

173
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,708
At age five, you were able to perform
exactly as I wanted.

174
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,791
In just a few shots,

175
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,875
you took apart that genius child actor.

176
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,166
What I meant…

177
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,458
is that I lack that special gift

178
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,708
to stand before others.

179
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,291
You mean compared to Ai?

180
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,500
That comparison is meaningless.

181
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,541
Ai was truly a one-of-a-kind talent.

182
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:49,250
I've seen hundreds of promising rookies.

183
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,708
I'm B-Komachi's Ai of Ichigo Production.

184
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,541
But nothing floored me like Ai.

185
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,708
Whatever. I just think people should
know their limits.

186
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,625
You're far too young to say that.

187
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,875
If a kid can't dream, who can?

188
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,708
You have to believe more in yourself.

189
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,583
Taishi!

190
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,666
Lunch is ready!

191
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,458
Mom! I'm having a serious conversation!

192
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,750
What?

193
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,500
The words of a man still living
at home ring a bit hollow.

194
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,291
You're in your forties. Move out.

195
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,416
It's a big house in the city.
You can't beat that.

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,083
Lots of creators do this.

197
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,666
Taishi, lunch!

198
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,583
Can't you knock?

199
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,333
He's in middle school.

200
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,916
Ai was truly

201
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,541
a one-of-a-kind talent.

202
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,333
DON'T OPEN TILL 18, AQUA
OPEN AT 18, RUBY

203
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,208
Three more years, huh?

204
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,291
Looking cute again today.

205
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,750
Mama, I'll see you later.

206
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,125
-Morning
-Morning!

207
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,500
YOTO SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL

208
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,541
Hey! Morning!

209
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,041
Are you nervous?

210
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,583
Should I be?

211
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,625
I am. I mean it's our
first day of high school.

212
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,000
School is school.

213
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,166
Can't wait for lunch.

214
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,625
Food again?

215
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,166
-I want steak.
-No chance.

216
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,916
They might have it.

217
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,083
At Performing Arts, maybe.

218
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,166
I bet they do.

219
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
Morning!

220
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,500
How was your day?

221
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,625
I couldn't fit in at all.

222
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,708
Why not?

223
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,458
So many celebrities.

224
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:56,916
A bikini model.

225
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,125
Gorgeous model.

226
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,958
A top idol and a model.

227
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,166
What did you expect from Performing Arts?

228
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,833
I need to get famous quickly
or I'll die of embarrassment.

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,041
Any buzz for you?

230
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,041
A little bit during roll call.

231
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:18,291
With a name like "Aquamarine,"
it must be tough.

232
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,958
You there!

233
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:28,750
You're Aqua Hoshino, aren't you?

234
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,583
That's right.

235
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,583
I thought so!

236
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,291
You are?

237
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,500
Kana Arima. We worked together as kids.

238
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,750
Kana Arima?

239
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,083
This is a professional workplace.
Go play somewhere else.

240
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,541
I remember you.

241
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,625
"High on baking soda."

242
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,625
It's "pecking order."

243
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,791
Now I remember. How've you been?

244
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,416
I'm so glad.

245
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,125
I thought you might've given up acting.

246
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,166
I did.

247
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,083
What? Then why are you at this school?

248
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,875
To look after my sister.

249
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:19,083
My brother's obsessed with me.

250
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,791
To study entertainment?

251
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,833
No, she is. I'm just in General Ed.

252
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
But why?

253
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,083
Aqua, I've never really liked this girl.

254
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,750
She's an upperclassman. Just fake it.

255
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,208
I can hear everything you say.

256
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:38,083
See you around, Loli-senpai.

257
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,833
Later.

258
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,666
Wait! Don't go yet!

259
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,916
Drat!

260
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,416
Tell me why you quit acting.

261
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
I lack talent.

262
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,458
What've you been doing?

263
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,833
Nothing in particular.

264
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,875
-Stop running from me.
-I'm not.

265
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,791
You clearly are.

266
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,208
Wait!

267
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,166
Will you wait a second?

268
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,041
GOTANDA STUDIO

269
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,375
SEAWEED PASTE

270
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,041
-Hello.
-What's up?

271
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,000
About that offline recording…

272
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm not done yet!

273
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,958
Director Gotanda?

274
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,666
Who're you?

275
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,166
Color me surprised. Kana Arima, huh?

276
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,000
I'd forgotten all about you,
but how you've grown.

277
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,541
Um, I am still working, actually.

278
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,333
Maybe not as much as when I was a kid.

279
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,708
Mom, go sit over there.

280
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,791
Go.

281
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:57,958
Now back to you.

282
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:04,041
I think you're limiting your exposure
to remove the child actor image.

283
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,000
-You think wrong.
-Then why do you hang out here?

284
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,208
I aspire to work crew.

285
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:14,500
Crew? You should be trying
to make it as an actor!

286
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,875
You can give up after being crushed by me.

287
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:24,291
Don't tell me you're still sore about
that shoot.

288
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,041
Please let me do it again, Director.

289
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,416
I need to prove…

290
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:37,208
I can do better than that kid.

291
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:45,416
Well, I was the undisputed
child prodigy of the time.

292
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,708
I admit I was traumatized.

293
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,458
You see? Your talent's been validated
by an ex-prodigy.

294
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,500
I didn't say anything about talent.

295
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,000
You really should try acting again.

296
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,791
He's right.

297
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,125
A producer who loves me
gave me the lead in his drama.

298
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,958
Some of the roles haven't been cast yet.

299
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,250
Not interested.

300
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,583
-I could speak on your behalf.
-No thank you.

301
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,375
Adaptation of a popular girl's comic.

302
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,875
Not interested.

303
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,833
And it's by producer Kaburagi,

304
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,583
who's become a surefire hit maker.

305
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,000
Kaburagi?

306
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,875
Masaya Kaburagi?

307
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,083
MASAYA KABURAGI

308
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,166
It's not fair!

309
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,041
Why does Aqua get work and not me?

310
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:56,875
It's just a minor drama
on a streaming service. No biggie.

311
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,791
They're on a tight budget and schedule.

312
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,291
Not fair, Aqua.

313
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,500
Shooting starts tomorrow with no prep.

314
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,250
It's no picnic.

315
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,666
I thought you were through
with showbiz, Aqua.

316
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,291
I've got a bit part in three scenes.

317
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,708
My role is a heroine's stalker.

318
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,500
How ironic.

319
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,083
What's the title?

320
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,666
Today Will Be Sweet.

321
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,958
I saw the first episode.

322
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,875
Oh, thanks.

323
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,416
I was too upset to see it to the end.

324
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,916
They took your hard-wrought story

325
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,708
and turned it into a trashy drama.

326
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,875
Well, I expected it from the start.

327
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Top manga artists warned me
when the serial rights were bought.

328
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,125
"Don't expect too much."

329
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,708
It's not the manga I love.

330
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:02,875
TODAY WILL BE SWEET

331
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,833
It was a pain.

332
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,833
Mr. Kaburagi.

333
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,541
Here's our villain.

334
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,791
I'm Aqua Hoshino of Ichigo Production.

335
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,958
Welcome.

336
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,875
I'm the producer, Kaburagi.

337
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,708
Do with the role what you will.

338
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,833
Thank you.

339
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,875
-Your dressing room.
-Thank you very much!

340
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,375
Thank you everyone!

341
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,875
We're about to roll. Check Melt's wig.

342
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,250
Places, everyone. We're starting.

343
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,625
Good luck.

344
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,083
We're rolling.

345
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,125
Scene 818, A1-B1.

346
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,541
-On your marks.
-On your marks…

347
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,666
And action!

348
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,875
What? No smile for me?

349
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,375
You're so cute.

350
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,958
Stop it. You're just making fun of me.

351
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,708
You're blushing.

352
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,250
I like that, too.

353
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,708
-Cut.
-Cut!

354
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,958
That's a keeper.

355
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,291
It is? You've got to be kidding me.

356
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,458
This is pathetic.

357
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,208
Especially that Melt Narushima.

358
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,708
He's a model. It's his first acting gig.

359
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,666
And your acting's tepid, Arima.

360
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,708
Well, duh. I have to.

361
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:13,500
You'll only damage your reputation
by acting down like that.

362
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,750
Tell me about it.

363
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,583
It's frustrating.

364
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:25,375
-Then don't…
-I'm a trained actor. I can't go all out.

365
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:28,791
I'll stick out like a wet rag.

366
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,708
-Sore thumb.
-Yeah, for overall balance

367
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:35,500
this is the only way.

368
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:42,833
You think that'll please the writer?

369
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:49,000
Ms. Kichijoji.

370
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,750
She visited the set once.

371
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,625
Idiot!

372
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:01,500
Hey, you get back here!

373
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,958
You okay? She slapped you so hard.

374
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:06,583
-Cut.
-Cut!

375
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,625
Checking the shot.

376
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,208
She had the look…

377
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,250
It's a keeper.

378
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,083
…of abject disappointment.

379
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:23,458
It's too late to do anything
about the other actors.

380
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,333
But I refuse

381
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,833
to betray the writer

382
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,791
or the viewers any further.

383
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:37,000
On such a tight budget and schedule,

384
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,833
the crew is working day and night.

385
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,250
I'm duty bound

386
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,625
to make it "watchable."

387
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,125
That's my job as lead actress.

388
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,750
Producer Kaburagi said,

389
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:03,041
"We need a real actor like you
on this project."

390
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,833
After ten years in the shadows,

391
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,375
my talent is finally getting recognized.

392
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,083
If I improve this even a smidge,

393
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,083
what's a little bit of bad acting?

394
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,833
Help me, Aqua.

395
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:31,583
Let's work together

396
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,208
to make this good.

397
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,916
Great work, Mr. Kaburagi.

398
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,583
How did you get Kana Arima
to sign onto this?

399
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,166
She hasn't been working at all.

400
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,750
When I said I needed a real actor,
she jumped at it.

401
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:10,333
Who's watching this for the acting?
It's to see cute male models.

402
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,291
Yes, I know.

403
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:22,541
But despite her name value,
she's practically working for free.

404
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,291
Way to squeeze that orange, Mr. Kaburagi.

405
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,416
Are we running behind?

406
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,375
Nope. Right on time.

407
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,791
-We'll speed up later.
-Alright.

408
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,666
Recognizing her talent, my ass.

409
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,916
I got what I came for.

410
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,916
Now I'll wreak havoc.

411
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,708
Ready to roll.

412
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,041
-Places, please.
-Places everyone.

413
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,708
Good luck.

414
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,291
Roll the camera.

415
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,458
Rolling.

416
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,666
Scene 822, A1 and B1.

417
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,791
-Rolling.
-Rolling!

418
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,166
Ready…

419
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,458
action!

420
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,041
The camera was rolling.

421
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,750
As soon as I heard the clapper,

422
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,666
I was overcome with exaltation.

423
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,208
A sublime pleasure felt only in this spot.

424
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:35,750
I've known and felt it all my life.

425
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:43,041
A critical scene where the heroine
confronts her stalker.

426
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,958
I have to make it work.

427
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,708
Listen up.

428
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,208
That woman there

429
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,791
isn't the person you think she is.

430
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,416
Way to go, Aqua.

431
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,666
Performing like you've never been away.

432
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:12,541
I'll sync up with him, and support Melt.

433
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,333
Hey, what's the big idea?

434
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:18,500
I spoke too soon. I can't follow that!

435
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:22,583
What do you know about my girl?

436
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,375
Director, please yell "Cut."

437
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,833
Where's the dark tension of this scene?

438
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,625
Do looks trump acting that much?

439
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,625
She's not worth protecting.

440
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,500
Wait, that line's not in the script.

441
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,500
That punk… do we stop this?

442
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,333
No, keep rolling.

443
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,416
You're ugly up close.

444
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,833
Poor facial symmetry without retouching.

445
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:51,958
What did you say?

446
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,458
B-cam, zoom in.

447
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,583
I'll kill you, punk!

448
00:30:56,666 --> 00:31:01,708
Wow, he pissed the guy off
to draw out genuine emotion.

449
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,583
Here's the moment you've waited for.

450
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,916
Let me show you the darkness
you've been carrying.

451
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:22,416
Come to think of it, I'd been
walking in the dark all this time.

452
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,583
They all called me a child prodigy.

453
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,291
Everyone fawned over me.

454
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,291
But then,

455
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:36,041
I hit puberty
and the work completely dried up.

456
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:39,291
They call me "washed up" online.

457
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:45,458
But I've clung to this work,
finally landing me here.

458
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:51,291
I understand now
that nobody is looking at my acting.

459
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,375
Nobody knows that more deeply than me.

460
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:58,791
Nobody needs you, got it?

461
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,000
Stop dreaming and face the truth.

462
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,708
You're just condemned to walk
in darkness forever.

463
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,166
Maybe so, but…

464
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,708
in the distance…

465
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,125
I still see light.

466
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,708
-Cut!
-Cut!

467
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,583
-Okay!
-Good scene!

468
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,666
Good scene.

469
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,666
That was amazingly good.

470
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,333
-Cue the next scene.
-Yes, sure.

471
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,416
-No waiting.
-Let's start then!

472
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,541
Right!

473
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,750
Scene 824, cut 2, frame 60.

474
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,500
-Places, please.
-Places.

475
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:04,416
And action.

476
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,625
Cue the wind.

477
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:30,375
HER LOOK IS OF A GIRL IN LOVE

478
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,458
The final episode of Today Sweet

479
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,000
didn't garner much buzz after all.

480
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:40,833
But in far-flung corners,
people quietly praised it.

481
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,541
…condemned to walk in darkness forever.

482
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,583
Maybe so, but…

483
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,083
I still see light.

484
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,833
Where are you going?

485
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,958
To the wrap party.

486
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:14,416
But you said you weren't going.

487
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:18,416
TODAY WILL BE SWEET - WRAP PARTY

488
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,708
Hello.

489
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:41,125
I wasn't aware of all the people
involved on a set.

490
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,250
That's right.

491
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:48,583
That's why the pressure's on us
to produce results.

492
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,500
Scandals are a death blow.

493
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,250
Some films go straight from wrap
into storage.

494
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,708
I'm sure.

495
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:06,166
So are you like…
seeing anybody right now?

496
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,625
Nope. Totally scandal free.

497
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,291
That's good.

498
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:17,083
Ms. Kichijoji, thank you for coming.

499
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,625
Congratulations.

500
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,125
Ms. Arima.

501
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,500
Ms. Kichijoji, hello.

502
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,791
The last episode…

503
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,291
was really, really good.

504
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,708
This drama succeeded…

505
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,791
because you set the tone with your acting.

506
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,375
Thank you so much.

507
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,125
It was an honor.

508
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,541
Aqua, was it?

509
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:23,708
Great scene earlier.
I hear it was mostly ad-libbed.

510
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Sort of.

511
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,666
I noticed during editing that you
bear a strong resemblance

512
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,958
to B-Komachi's Ai.

513
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,791
Do I?

514
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,750
You do.

515
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,125
I saw Ai up close quite frequently.

516
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,541
May I ask

517
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,333
the nature of your relationship?

518
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,875
What was she like?

519
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,708
Why the interest?

520
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:12,041
I used to be a fan. A really huge one.

521
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,375
Well, this info doesn't come free.

522
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:22,791
But I'll be in touch soon.

523
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:26,166
Mr. Kaburagi, over here!

524
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,125
-No, thanks.
-Over here!

525
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:31,000
You're all too drunk for me.

526
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,583
Tell me, Ms. Saitoh.

527
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,125
When will you make me an idol?

528
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:41,958
Don't rush me.
I just restarted the company.

529
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:47,291
There's a process to follow
in creating an idol group.

530
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,875
What process?

531
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:54,916
First, we need to find members.
And for that, we need a top scout.

532
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,791
I'm back.

533
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,083
Hey.

534
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,208
A scout, huh?

535
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,833
Why don't you let me try?

536
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:08,625
The problem is the cutest girls
get swooped up by major agencies.

537
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,500
Finding untouched ones in Tokyo
is near impossible.

538
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,708
Oh, Aqua. Here.

539
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:20,250
This came for you.

540
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,958
Thanks.

541
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:35,833

He's clean.

544
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,375
Yeah?

545
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,208
Hey, do me a favor, will ya?

546
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,083
WE NEED TO TALK.
MEET ME AFTER SCHOOL. - AQUA

00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,250
What's so important, I wonder.

548
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:28,041
If it's after school, does it mean…?

549
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,333
He's got a crush on me?

550
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh no. What I mean is
I'm flattered and all but…

551
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,625
What do I do? No, really?

552
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,750
Why are you here?

553
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,708
It's not my brother, Loli-senpai,

554
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,125
but it's me who needs to talk to you.

555
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,166
Sorry.

556
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,666
My brother's obsessed with me.

557
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,416
What do you want?

558
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,375
You've got 20 seconds. I'm a busy girl.

559
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,958
She clearly doesn't want to listen.

560
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,291
Do your best.

561
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,416
Miss Kana Arima.

562
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:37,666
What?

563
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:41,958
Will you form an idol group with me?

564
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,833
-I said, "Will you form an idol…"?
-Pass!

565
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,375
What, so fast?

566
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,625
This is me scouting you.

567
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Scouting?

568
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:07,083
Ichigo Production is back
and plans to form an idol unit.

569
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,500
We're looking for members.

570
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,750
I thought of you first, Loli-senpai.

571
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,250
Wait, are you being serious with me?

572
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,000
Dead serious.

573
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,583
So why me?

574
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:33,791
Well, you're free and
for someone so famous…

575
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,625
out of work.

576
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,958
Are you picking a fight?

577
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,250
And a really cute face.

578
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,625
Angelic childhood innocence.

579
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,958
Well-groomed shiny hair.

580
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,083
And irresistible charm.

581
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:54,666
Experience tells me you're just the type

582
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,083
that pudgy nerds spend money on!

583
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,166
I'll kick your ass.

584
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,750
Listen, Arima.

585
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,208
I'm asking, too.

586
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:12,791
I'm not cute enough to make it as an idol.

587
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,791
-Yes, you are.
-Thump.

588
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:18,083
You're cuter than all those
garden variety idols.

589
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,125
Thump thump.

590
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,750
I'm not asking you to quit acting
to become a full-time idol.

591
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:32,041
But I can entrust my dear sis with you.

592
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,250
I need…

593
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,041
to think it over.

594
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,375
-Senpai.
-I said I'd think it over.

595
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,708
You can be an actor all your life.

596
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:55,875
But you can only be an idol right now.

597
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,875
ARIMA

598
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,041
Welcome to Ichigo.

599
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,708
My head is saying "no" to this.

600
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:16,166
Why am I such an easy pushover?

601
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,416
Let's give it our all, Loli-senpai.

602
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,833
Stop it with that.

603
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:30,333
The "ex-child prodigy actor" label is now

604
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:33,000
"ex-child prodigy idol."

605
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,250
Okay, I'm calling it quits.

606
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,541
Too late. You affixed your seal.

607
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,500
-Address me with respect!
-No way.

608
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,750
-Don't say "No way"!
-It's a pain.

609
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:49,166
I'm a veteran! I've been in
showbiz since I was in diapers!

610
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,791
Hello?

611
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:58,583
Kaburagi here. How've you been?

612
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,166
Fine.

613
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:05,291
I'm in the middle of a casting meeting
for my next project.

614
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:10,166
Want to take part in
a reality dating show?

615
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,458
If you agree to appear,

616
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:19,916
I'll share deep backstage tales of Ai.

617
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:25,541
For example, stories about
the men in her life.

618
