MIYAZAKI PREFECTURE, 2002

SARINA TENDOJI

00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,916
AI LOVE FOREVER!

B-KOMACHI TOUR 2002 SAGA CONCERT

5
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,333
Good morning.

6
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, it's you, Doctor.

7
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,000
Disappointed?

8
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,708
My test results came back bad.

9
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,000
So no concert for me.

10
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,875
I see.

11
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,916
I wanted to go even if it killed me.

12
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,875
Don't talk like that.

13
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,708
After all…

14
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,625
you got me the tickets.

15
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,291
It can't be helped.

16
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,583
Maybe a stroll and some fresh air
will do you good.

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,083
Okay, this looks like a good spot.

18
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:04,708
Here.

19
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,500
What is this?

20
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,041
A time capsule.

21
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,166
What will burying that prove?

22
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,250
We'll dig it up together someday.

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:41,375
And I'll take you all cured
to a B-Komachi concert.

24
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,166
You will?

25
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,583
But you're so cute,
I worry you may be scouted.

26
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,666
What? You think so?

27
00:02:54,416 --> 00:03:00,333
I'll protect you from evil scouts.
Showbiz can be a dangerous place.

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,708
Too overprotective.

29
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,958
The next time we open this,

30
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,125
we'll look back on today and laugh.

31
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,208
How come you're so kind, Doctor?

32
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,166
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,500
I'd like to know that myself.

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,708
Want me to be one?

35
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:42,041
God no. Society would crucify me.

36
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,375
Are you ready?

37
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,125
We can watch the concert DVD together.

38
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,333
Good idea.

39
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
Are you telling me to buy it?

40
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,000
No. Well, maybe.

41
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,375
DR. GORO AMAMIYA

42
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,041
I'd like Ai all to myself but…

43
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,125
we'll share.

44
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,541
Thanks.

45
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,833
DNA SIBLING TEST RESULTS

46
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,250
What can you tell me…

47
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,791
about our father?

48
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,541
Half-brothers, huh?

49
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,208
It's not inconceivable.

50
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:48,541
If you went to all this trouble,
you must've had a hunch.

51
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,958
Who's your mother, Aqua?

52
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,708
I can't tell you.

53
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,083
I see. A celebrity, huh?

54
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,666
I'd heard rumors about my womanizing dad.

55
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:10,958
But I had no idea
he was spreading his seeds.

56
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,708
My dad's name was Seijuro Uehara.

57
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,875
Pretty much a failed actor.

58
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,541
I regret to inform that your father
is deceased.

59
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,833
He's no longer among the living, huh?

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,125
Nope.

61
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:51,291
He committed suicide with my mom.
I was a kid.

62
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:59,416
My mom was the marquee actress
at the time Lala Lai started up.

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,541
Her pregnancy came at a bad time.

64
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:08,791
She stuck it out until it was time,
then quit the stage.

65
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,083
She refused to reveal my father's name.

66
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,416
And then I was born.

67
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,666
My folks were married when you were born.

68
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,875
Which means you're a love child.

69
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,125
A love child.

70
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:37,666
When I was a kid,
I hated my father with a passion.

71
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,125
By sleeping with talented actresses…

72
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:46,208
he thought he could ease
his inferiority complex.

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,666
What our father lacked in acting talent,
he made up for being a cad.

74
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:03,166
Your flirting with Kana and Akane
is in your DNA.

75
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,291
-You're wrong.
-I'm right.

76
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,791
I'd change my ways…

77
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,541
or you'll end up like Dad.

78
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,541
Once you're dead, you can't fix anything.

79
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,333
Any other questions?

80
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,625
No.

81
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,916
That's all.

82
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,083
I'd spent over ten years searching
for my real dad,

83
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
only to find out…

84
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,208
he died long ago.

85
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,541
Being out all night is a bad look.

86
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,875
What?

87
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,958
I spent the night at Himekawa's house.

88
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,833
Of Tokyo Blade?

89
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,833
Yeah, so rest easy.

90
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,875
If you're bonding with male friends,
I guess I can forgive you.

91
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,541
Is Ai's enemy no longer alive?

92
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,958
Is my vendetta over?

93
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,708
Can it be over?

94
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,750
Can I call it quits?

95
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,833
Am I now free to live…

96
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,125
a normal life?

97
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,041
Hey, Big Bro.

98
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,875
Want breakfast? I'm gonna fry some eggs.

99
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,166
Yeah.

100
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,500
I'd love some.

101
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,916
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL GRAPHIC NOVEL
"OSHI NO KO"

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,250
BY AKA AKASAKA × MENGO YOKOYARI,
PUBLISHED BY SHUEISHA

103
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,375
No. Open your eyes!

104
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,958
Stop. Cut to a closeup a little quicker.

105
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,333
Yes, sir.

106
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,833
The day after the last shoot…

107
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,125
I couldn't be by your side.

108
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,458
…The final episode aired.

109
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,791
Yes.

110
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,250
God, this is good.

111
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,708
No. Open your eyes.

112
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,791
Ratings exceeded the premiere.

113
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:59,250
And streaming views after the airing
hit a record-breaking high.

114
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:05,208
The serial drama Tokyo Blade
went out in a blaze of glory.

115
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,458
This shot could be cuter.

116
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,916
For sure.

117
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
With shooting all done,
my schedule became a blank slate.

118
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,958
What the heck do I do now?

119
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,041
You coming?

120
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,166
To Miyazaki.

121
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,375
Miyazaki?

122
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,208
To shoot a music video.

123
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,583
Mem-cho's video artist friend
is shooting it for us.

124
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,916
The very place we were born.

125
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,625
The place…

126
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,125
I met my death.

127
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
You seem a shell of yourself
since Tokyo Blade.

128
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,208
Maybe burnout syndrome?

129
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,750
You could use a change of pace.

130
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,958
A post-drama pleasure trip.

131
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,750
You could come with us.

132
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,041
Yeah, come with us, Big Bro.

133
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:21,958
In that case, why not invite Akane, too?

134
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,125
What?

135
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,750
She's busy. Unlike Kana,
Akane's in great demand.

136
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,041
You're probably right.

137
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,375
Count me in for Miyazaki.

138
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,833
I'll ask Akane, too.

139
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,916
Did something happen?

140
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,708
Like what?

141
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,708
You have kind of a nostalgic look.

142
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Do I really?

143
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,375
Akane, over here!

144
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

145
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,000
-Long time, no see.
-I know.

146
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,875
Hello. I'm Akane Kurokawa.

147
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,500
Pleasure. I'm Miyako Saitoh.

148
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,708
Thanks for looking after Aqua.

149
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,041
Not at all.

150
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,041
I'm his little sis, Ruby.

151
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,875
You're prettier in real life.

152
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,041
I saw Tokyo Blade.

153
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,208
Thank you.

154
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,833
I was in it, too!

155
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,458
What does such a beauty see in my brother?

156
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,791
Has he got something on you?

157
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,958
What sort of person do you think I am?

158
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,708
Nice rapport.

159
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,833
Never mind. You're a minute late.

160
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:07,791
Five minutes early is basic etiquette.
Industry standard.

161
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,916
I'll have you know that
I'm not here for work.

162
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,000
Take it easy.

163
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,416
Ms. Akane?

164
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,375
Can I call you Big Sis?

165
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,791
I mean, if you marry Aqua,
that's what you'll become.

166
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:30,375
I might as well get used to
calling you that now.

167
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,875
Wait, Kana.

168
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,625
Can you believe she accepted the invite?

169
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,250
Can't she tell a social gesture?

170
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,875
Let's try to be nice, okay?

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,625
I'm going home.

172
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
Kana, your baggage!

173
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,500
Shut up! Don't speak to me.

174
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,708
I haven't.

175
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,500
Go play footsie with Akane.

176
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,583
Snarky as always.

177
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,875
"Big Sis"? Really?

178
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,041
That was Ruby.

179
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,041
But you didn't deny it.

180
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:33,875
-How long is this charade going…?
-It's ending this trip.

181
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,083
Is that right?

182
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,000
We can't keep it up forever.

183
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,166
Oh.

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,375
Well, breakups can be hard on people,
so be careful.

185
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,625
Most mystery movie killers
are jilted lovers.

186
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,958
If you need an adult to talk to, I'm here.

187
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,166
Mem-cho!

188
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,708
Anemone!

189
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,958
How've you been?

190
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,791
-Been well?
-You bet.

191
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,458
Thank you for coming all this way.

192
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,625
I'm the director, Anemone.

193
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,958
Thanks for having us.

194
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,416
The air here is so fresh.

195
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,541
And I'm starving.

196
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,875
Bad reception. I can't Google myself.

197
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,041
Sorry. They're still children.

198
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:07,208
I had trouble getting Wi-Fi too
when I first arrived.

199
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,583
Sightseeing!

200
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,166
Food first!

201
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,000
I need reception.

202
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:18,041
Before all that,
let me warn you the schedule's real tight.

203
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,166
Let's get moving.

204
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,250
Great. Go to work, girls.

205
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,166
Come. Start walking.

206
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,375
-But I'm too weak with hunger.
-There's no reception.

207
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,208
-Good luck!
-Gotcha!

208
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,708
So what do we do?

209
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,291
Take in some sights?
Or visit a hot spring?

210
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,500
I have a place in mind.

211
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,125
Okay.

212
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,041
If you've got somewhere you want to go,
count me in.

213
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:14,500
Here in Takachiho, there's a shrine
to the god of entertainment.

214
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,375
From Japanese mythology.

215
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto.

216
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,625
You knew that? I shouldn't be surprised.

217
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,625
Actually,

218
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,958
Ruby and I were born in this town.

219
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,708
Really? I had no idea.

220
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,250
It feels so long since Love for Real.

221
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:01,333
There were tough moments,
but I loved that shoot.

222
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,000
You and I began…

223
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,833
as a programmed couple.

224
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,375
It's time I returned your freedom.

225
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,541
You're right.

226
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,416
We're not actual lovers or anything.

227
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,958
A remote place for a house.

228
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,875
AMAMIYA

229
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,750
Is this the home of a relative of yours?

230
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,458
No, more of an acquaintance.

231
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,291
But there's nobody living here anymore.

232
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,000
Pardon us.

233
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,666
Did this guy live here?

234
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,875
Goro Amamiya.

235
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:58,208
A run-of-the-mill ob-gyn.

236
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,416
A doctor?

237
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,083
He didn't have a mother.

238
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,875
She died giving birth.

239
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:18,166
She hid her pregnancy from everyone,
and gave birth to him alone.

240
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:24,083
But she bled too much.
Obstetric crisis hemorrhage.

241
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,541
The ambulance arrived too late.

242
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:30,875
So he grew up…

243
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,125
never knowing his mother's face.

244
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,500
Nor his father's.

245
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,666
He was raised here by his grandfolks.

246
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,541
Do you know where he is now?

247
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,791
Dead.

248
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:02,041
I'm pretty sure.

249
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,333
He fell from a cliff in the dark.

250
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,625
His body was never found.

251
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:14,958
Ultimately,

252
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,625
the guilt of living while his mom died

253
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,958
haunted him all his life.

254
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:29,708
You talk as if you experienced
this all yourself.

255
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:37,166
Seeing as you came all the way out here,

256
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,833
I gather he must've been important to you.

257
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,708
He's just…

258
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,166
an old friend.

259
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,666
Sound.

260
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,625
Cheers!

261
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,833
Move in.

262
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,125
Slowly.

263
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,666
Something's missing here. She's dull.

264
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,000
Who's dull?

265
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:19,000
Ruby. She's got idol written all over her,
but…

266
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,916
on camera, she's got zilch.

267
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,708
Maybe too cookie cutter?

268
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,208
Like she's copying someone.

269
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:36,791
On the other hand,
this Center, I can understand.

270
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,416
Yeah, okay.

271
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,916
-Now the dance part.
-Okay.

272
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,125
-Review the steps.
-Okay.

273
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,666
-How's it going?
-Welcome back!

274
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,208
-Pardon us.
-Non-staff outside.

275
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,333
Easy easy.

276
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:07,625
Seriously?

277
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:12,791
You can't go on camera
with an untidy ribbon.

278
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,458
It's such a cute outfit.

279
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,166
You want to wear it well.

280
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,125
Is this better, then?

281
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:31,375
A slight improvement, I think.

282
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,083
Aqua?

283
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,791
Am I… cute enough?

284
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:44,041
Yeah, I think you sufficiently qualify.

285
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,708
You two suck at compliments.

286
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,666
Cheerfully!

287
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:56,375
Yeah, that's great.

288
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,666
Kana, turn as if you're looking
at someone you like.

289
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,125
Wow, that's a great face.

290
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,458
So that person exists.

291
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,083
Absolutely not.

292
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,500
Bullseye.

293
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,875
Don't be silly.

294
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,041
And you, Mem-cho?

295
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:47,333
-"Someone you like," huh?
-Not telling. It's a secret.

296
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,916
Kana really is a genuine idol, isn't she?

297
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,166
I'm jealous.

298
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,000
I think I can understand why
her acting's improved.

299
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,708
Do you think she can sell…

300
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,875
as an idol?

301
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,625
She can.

302
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,333
I see.

303
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,333
Then she's going to have to be
wary of scandals.

304
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,291
You'd best not be seen together in public.

305
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,291
Even if you're innocent…

306
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,958
people like to misread things
and make up stories.

307
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,958
It only takes one flaming to end a career.

308
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,458
She's right. Arima's an idol.

309
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,458
Having a man in the wings…

310
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,125
can never end well.

311
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,416
In the worst case…

312
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,083
Yeah.

313
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,458
You're right.

314
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,375
Ruby, you're done today.
Next is Kana's solo part.

315
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,750
Minors must be done by 10 p.m.

316
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,125
Okay.

317
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:43,541
Mem can stay a while.
Though she's "eighteen."

318
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,583
That's right. I'm eighteen and above.

319
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:51,291
-Good work.
-Thank you.

320
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:01,041
Ruby. Good work today.

321
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,083
Sorry if this is sudden, but…

322
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,083
would you accompany me somewhere?

323
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,416
You want me? Not Aqua?

324
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,375
I'd be happy to.

325
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,458
Really?

326
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,916
How much of an age difference is okay?

327
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,333
I find mental age more important.

328
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,083
Ten years is totally fine.

329
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,541
Wait, are you confiding?

330
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,958
Don't tell me you're in love with
an older man.

331
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,000
Don't tell Aqua.

332
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,375
What's he like?

333
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,416
The kindest person you'd ever meet.

334
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:02,125
When I was all alone a long time,
he stood by me.

335
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,250
He cheered me up.

336
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:09,541
Without him, I'd have never
dreamed of becoming an idol.

337
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:15,375
He gave me a reason to live.

338
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:20,250
I know what you mean.

339
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,208
It's great having someone you love.

340
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,791
What's your approach? I can…

341
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,875
That person went missing some time ago.

342
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,000
He suddenly vanished from his job.

343
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,791
How awful.

344
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:45,125
So when we perform at Tokyo Dome…

345
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,791
and become famous idols,
he'll come see me.

346
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:55,416
Yeah, he will. He'll definitely
come support you.

347
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,666
I can't wait…

348
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,625
to see him again.

349
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:07,291
MIYAZAKI GENERAL HOSPITAL

350
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:16,208
This is where you and Aqua were born.

351
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,083
What is it, Ruby?

352
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,791
Sorry. Memories just came flooding back.

353
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,875
It's locked.
I guess they're closed for the night.

354
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:47,458
Do you still know people here?

355
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,666
No, it's nothing like that.

356
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:56,958
The back door?

357
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,458
Hello?

358
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:16,083
Hello, is anybody there?

359
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:20,375
STAFF ENTRANCE

360
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,750
Yes, can I help you?

361
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:30,541
I want to ask about a doctor
who used to work here.

362
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,541
I'm afraid there's nobody
in charge at this hour.

363
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,500
Can you come tomorrow?

364
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,750
I've only got today.

365
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,291
But I really can't help you.

366
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:46,625
A doctor named Goro Amamiya…

367
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,666
used to work here 15 years ago.

368
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,875
Amamiya?

369
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:57,291
You're an acquaintance of Dr. Amamiya?

370
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,458
You were born here on that day?

371
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,000
Yes, I'm Ruby Hoshino.

372
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:10,125
My, what a darling young woman
you've grown into.

373
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:16,583
As I recall, your mother, too,
was a stunning beauty herself.

374
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,250
I see. So you knew my mother.

375
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,958
How is she? Is she well?

376
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,458
I just remembered.

377
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,958
I have to call Ms. Saitoh.
I'll be outside.

378
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,458
So what can I help you with today?

379
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,791
It's a long time ago…

380
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,791
but I heard he suddenly vanished.

381
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,291
Dr. Amamiya is no longer with us.

382
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,083
We lost contact with him
several years ago.

383
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:03,333
But I won't believe it until I learn more.

384
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,750
Do you know anything?

385
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,708
Even the tiniest detail, please.

386
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,833
It was the strangest day.

387
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,916
The strangest day?

388
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:27,750
The moment your mother gave birth,
we went to get Dr. Amamiya.

389
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:34,416
But on the way to the delivery room,

390
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:40,541
Dr. Amamiya suddenly began following
a suspicious man in the hospital.

391
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,208
A suspicious man?

392
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,833
The two of you were born
without complications.

393
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:55,416
But after that,
we never heard from Dr. Amamiya again.

394
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:00,500
He disappeared the day we were born?

395
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,041
Like he had somehow been spirited away.

396
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,500
Many rumors began swirling about him.

397
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:19,916
That he had women troubles
or debts he was running from.

398
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:25,916
But I think it had something to do with
those strange men.

399
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,333
Strange "men"?

400
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,416
I even told the police.

401
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,500
There was a collegiate type man…

402
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:40,916
and another nice-looking man
hanging around the hospital.

403
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,750
Another man?

404
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:48,291
Out here in the country,
people like that stand out.

405
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,291
I never learned who they were.

406
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,250
I see.

407
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:06,125
But you've rekindled memories.

408
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,041
Dr. Amamiya was one-of-a-kind.

409
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:15,166
He was a hardcore idol fan,
not your typical stuffy doc.

410
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,083
He had a great bedside manner.

411
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,041
Very kind to patients.

412
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,500
I sometimes find it hard to believe

413
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,958
that he was even here.

414
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:40,083
But I've aged and my memory isn't
as reliable as it used to be.

415
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,583
It's been over a decade
since he disappeared.

416
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,708
He's likely no longer…

417
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,166
Thank you very much.

418
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,708
Wait.

419
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,916
-You okay?
-Sorry. Let's go home.

420
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,708
The doctor is not dead.

421
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:14,416
He's not dead. I know it.

422
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,083
He couldn't be.

423
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,916
Ruby?

424
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,916
Found it.

425
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,791
The doctor is definitely alive.

426
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:30,166
You gave me your promise, remember?

427
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,958
He fell from a cliff in the dark.

428
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,708
His body was never found.

429
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,333
It can't be.

430
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,625
-What's wrong?
-Ruby, don't come!

431
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,708
Is that… a corpse?

432
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,625
In a white cloak. Could it be a doctor?

433
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:02,083
No, it can't be.
It has to be someone else.

434
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,416
Why? Why?

435
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,708
No.

436
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:46,791
You promised me, Doctor.

437
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,625
Doctor.

438
00:40:55,708 --> 00:41:00,125
From personal effects,
it's the body of Goro Amamiya.

439
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,541
Confirmed from the missing person file.

440
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,708
INTERROGATION ROOM 2

441
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,750
Thank you, Officer.

442
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:18,916
This trip has become a disaster.

443
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,375
Tomorrow's shoot…

444
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:27,708
Yeah, I'll be fine.

445
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,958
I'm sorry you had to see what you did.

446
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,791
-It's not your fault.
-No.

447
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,541
I invited you to join me on this trip.

448
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,458
None of it had to happen.

449
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,666
But it did, and I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

450
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,625
Stop that.

451
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,416
Why do you bear everything yourself?

452
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,375
Why do you blame yourself?

453
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:12,958
They say that the doctor's death
was likely a murder.

454
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:17,916
If anyone's to blame, it's the killer.

455
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:20,958
You've done nothing wrong.

456
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,333
The truth is…

457
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,958
I was hoping for it.

458
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:38,416
I hoped you might be the one
to find the body for me.

459
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,000
What do you mean?

460
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,083
I intentionally sowed seeds of information
for you to find.

461
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:53,708
I wanted you to find him for me.

462
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,333
Goro Amamiya.

463
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:02,041
A run-of-the-mill ob-gyn.

464
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,875
His body was never found.

465
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,250
So it was him after all.

466
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,833
I believed it suited me better now
for the body to be never found.

467
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:21,875
But deep down inside,
I really desired some closure.

468
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:26,958
-A coincidence. I did nothing.
-Doesn't matter.

469
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,625
I've been using you all this time

470
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,291
to find my enemy.

471
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,958
And a lot more, too.

472
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:41,166
-Sorry.
-I already knew that a long time ago.

473
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:49,250
That you were keeping me close
because I had value for you.

474
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,416
But on that night…

475
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:00,041
I like to believe you came…

476
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,416
without any ulterior motives.

477
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:11,000
So I decided that whatever cross
you may be bearing…

478
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,083
I'd bear it with you,

479
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:16,166
together with all your guilt.

480
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:26,333
So have you found the enemy
to take revenge on?

481
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,958
Nobody still in this world.

482
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Good then. I'm glad.

483
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,541
That means you've been freed
from a burden.

484
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:58,375
I suppose you no longer need me.

485
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,375
Let's end this here.

486
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,375
Goodbye.

487
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,708
Sorry. I hadn't planned on crying.

488
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:31,041
I thought we could split up
on more cheerful terms.

489
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,625
What went wrong?

490
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:41,208
I should've told you sooner.

491
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,916
My vendetta is over.

492
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,791
The body was found.

493
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,041
From now on…

494
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,166
I aim to protect you.

495
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,166
Okay, cut!

496
00:46:41,875 --> 00:46:47,625
Water's freezing. I'm gonna die!
I need a towel quickly!

497
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,291
That's a keeper.

498
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:56,333
Good. I'm not doing it again.

499
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:58,083
You were great.

500
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,000
The problem is that girl.

501
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,375
I'm sorry about yesterday.

502
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,541
You haven't slept.

503
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:22,708
Don't push too hard.

504
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,458
I'm okay.

505
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:45,583
"Suspicious men" means the doctor
was in some kind of trouble.

506
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,833
Did somebody hide his body?

507
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:54,750
If there were two involved,
did the collegiate guy kill Mama?

508
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,875
And did they kill the doctor, too?

509
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,833
Ruby!

510
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,875
You're on standby.

511
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:09,416
Watch out for that river. It's freezing.

512
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,458
Does that mean the other man…

513
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,500
hasn't been caught?

514
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,708
Ready, action!

515
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,875
Mama and the doctor…

516
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:38,000
were both taken from me.

517
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,458
While that murderer lives.

518
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,625
Shall we stop?

519
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,041
Yeah.

520
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:50,791
Wait.

521
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:57,708
I won't allow it.
I'll do whatever it takes to find him.

522
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,583
I'll find him.

523
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:08,208
And I promise…

524
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,916
I'll kill him myself.

525
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,583
-Cute shot, Kana.
-Really?

526
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:42,208
That's a wrap. Thanks for the hard work.

527
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,125
We're done!

528
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:47,041
Go enjoy the sights.

529
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,875
Our flight home is tomorrow.

530
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,083
So much for relaxing.

531
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:55,291
-Go soak in a hot spring tonight.
-Okay then.

532
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,625
Your car is waiting. This way.

533
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,125
Thank you.

534
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,500
Let's go, girls.

535
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,166
Jinx.

536
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,416
Tell me straight. How'd we do?

537
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,875
I'll need a little time.

538
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,791
What, were we that lame?

539
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,833
Nope.

540
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:20,666
I want time to approach this work
as an artist would.

541
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:33,166
From now on…

542
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,041
I aim to protect you.

543
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,958
Your face is red. Hot from the bath?

544
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:56,583
I may have gotten a bit hot, yes.

545
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:05,125
I think I had something
important on my mind.

546
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:10,208
But my head went numb
and now I don't care.

547
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,041
Well…

548
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,791
now's the time for it.

549
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:23,166
You've been given the lead in
a new movie, right? You're on fire.

550
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:28,541
You're wrong.
It's a low-budget pic for art houses.

551
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:34,416
But still nationwide distribution.
Pretty awesome.

552
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,083
I'm jealous.

553
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,000
This is surely an important time for you.

554
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:56,291
Ride this wave right, and you establish
the career of Akane Kurokawa.

555
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,083
Yet here you are in Miyazaki.
Isn't it time to let Love for Real go?

556
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:11,083
Love for Real is over.

557
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,958
Did he?

558
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:50,458
I wonder why Aqua ended up acting?

559
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:58,750
As a kid,
he was determined to assist a director.

560
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,083
He's fixed on this industry.

561
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,791
I thought you might know.

562
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,291
I think he's searching for someone.

563
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,416
To do so, he needs to succeed.
Something like that.

564
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,750
Who is that?

565
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,583
Probably an actor he admires.

566
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,541
He's more of a fanboy type
than he lets on.

567
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,416
I see.

568
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,750
-I'll take those.
-Thanks.

569
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,958
You shopped.

570
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,666
Yeah, I'm loaded down.

571
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,791
Are these all gifts?

572
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,416
-Yup.
-Or a cover for gorging?

573
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,791
I can't eat all this. So what'd you buy?

574
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Can I carry your bags?

575
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:12,875
Thanks.

576
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,166
Let's go.

577
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,000
Come on.

578
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,041
HOSHINO FAMILY TOMB

579
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:28,916
I'm guessing the man who killed Mama
and the doctor

580
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,166
are one in the same.

581
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,416
But there may also be a co-conspirator.

582
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:40,041
I'm going to find him and take revenge.

583
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:45,208
I believe Aqua is thinking the same thing.

584
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,333
She sure grew up a beauty.

585
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:27,625
Why wouldn't she?

586
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,541
She's our child after all.

587
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,916
THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION

588
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
