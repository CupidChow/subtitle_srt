1
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,916
Cut!

2
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,000
-Aqua!
-Is he okay?

3
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,166
Aqua.

4
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,625
I still sense it.

5
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,291
The smell of blood like rusted metal

6
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,791
clinging to me forever.

7
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,791
I feel her hand growing colder.

8
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,541
I can't forget it.

9
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,625
It's all your fault.

10
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:13,083
If you'd put your body on the line
to protect her...

11
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,208
Are you okay?

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,416
They'll reshoot your scene another day.

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,333
Today, just get some rest.

14
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,541
Want someone from home to pick you up?

15
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,208
Please don't.

16
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:38,583
Why not?

17
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,833
I don't want Ruby knowing.

18
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,708
GOTANDA STUDIO

19
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:59,500
Since when did I become your
personal chauffeur?

20
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,083
I'm gonna lie down upstairs.

21
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,375
His impudence never ceases to amaze.

22
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,625
Sorry to put you out.

23
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,208
Don't sweat it.

24
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,833
I'm the only one who knows his deal.

25
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,583
Take a seat.

26
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:20,958
Okay.

27
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,958
-Here.
-Thank you.

28
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,333
How'd it happen?

29
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:39,125
Shooting a scene where he loses
his best friend.

30
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,125
The director kept asking him
to show more emotion.

31
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,458
That would do it.

32
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,458
What's your relationship to Aqua?

33
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,666
Girlfriend?

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,541
As it were.

35
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,416
He gets around more than I thought.

36
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,666
I suppose his girlfriend
has a right to know.

37
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,125
What you saw today... Aqua collapsing.

38
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,541
It isn't the first time.

39
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,875
Panic attack, isn't it?

40
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
Yeah.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,625
As a child, he witnessed
a terrible incident.

42
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,333
When that memory is sparked,
this is what happens.

43
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,333
In short, he experiences PTSD.

44
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,416
He spent years in counseling over it,

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,416
but he tired of worrying his family.

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,541
So he feigned being cured.

47
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,708
But it's not something you forget.

48
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,208
I'm still not over it myself.

49
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,875
What sort of terrible incident?

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,041
I advise not probing too much.

51
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,416
I've gotta go.
Stay with him till I return.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,791
Understood.

53
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,625
Thanks.

54
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,000
Ai...

55
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,708
Aqua is with the Ichigo Production Co.,

56
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,958
where Ai once belonged.

57
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:03,958
He and his twin sister's guardian
is agency president Miyako Saitoh.

58
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,333
His sister just relaunched
Ai's old idol unit, B-Komachi.

59
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:15,750
Both twins have an inordinate
obsession with Ai.

60
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,208
What if somewhere her child
is alive and well?

61
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,416
As a child, he witnessed
a terrible incident.

62
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,083
Ai died a violent and tragic death.

63
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:34,083
If that's something that you
had to witness as a child...

64
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,833
my heart breaks for you.

65
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,833
Take it easy, Akane!

66
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,125
I'm not your enemy.

67
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,500
What's wrong?

68
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,083
Akane?

69
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,750
I just had a horrifying thought.

70
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,958
But I'm...

71
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,000
here for you no matter what.

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,875
Whatever pain you carry,
I want to bear it with you.

73
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,291
What's this about?

74
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:49,333
Just a "what if" scenario that
my wild imagination concocted.

75
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:56,375
Can we explain the character this way?

76
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,625
It does seem a departure
from the original.

77
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,291
But it links to Episode 4.

78
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,291
Any objections, Sensei?

79
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,583
Nope, it's fine by me.

80
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:14,458
Then we can print up Episode 3.
Good work, everyone.

81
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,333
-Good work.
-Good work.

82
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,250
When will you finish Episode 4?

83
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,541
Day after tomorrow.

84
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:28,750
Great, then I'll head back to the set.
Good luck.

85
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,916
We went all out with Episode 3.

86
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,500
Need a break before moving on?

87
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,625
Yes.

88
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,958
Track 12.

89
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,750
And action.

90
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,583
Just because of this, you...

91
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,833
Cut. Again.

92
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,583
Cut.

93
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,541
Director.

94
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,416
Can we wrap this scene?

95
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,458
We're running behind,
and need to edit Episode 1.

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,291
Bring eye drops.

97
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,041
Eye drops.

98
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,416
Thank you.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,125
-Once more.
-Sorry.

100
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,333
Try not to take it so hard.

101
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,916
Mr. Kindaichi always asks for
a lot from actors.

102
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:46,666
What kind of an actor am I
if I can't meet his demands?

103
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:50,583
It's clear I just don't have any talent.

104
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,166
If you don't feel you have the talent,
why do it?

105
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,666
Is it because you like acting?
Or the money?

106
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,625
You wouldn't understand if I told you.
So I won't.

107
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,041
I'm asking because I want to understand.

108
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,041
Say I told you my purpose...

109
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,291
was to murder someone? Then what?

110
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,791
What if there was someone in the industry

111
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm seeking out so I can kill him?

112
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,208
Then I'd kill him with you.

113
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:57,166
I trust you have a good reason
for wanting that person dead.

114
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,041
If you plan to bear that sin...

115
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,916
I want to bear it with you.

116
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,375
Don't take murder so lightly.

117
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,208
I'm prepared to be that kind
of girlfriend for you.

118
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:21,916
Even if we keep it strictly
a business relationship.

119
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,833
That's not a normal way to be.

120
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,791
I'm an actress. None of us are normal.

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,791
You may be right.

122
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,083
Despite no shortage of setbacks...

123
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,666
Tokyo Blade finally aired.

124
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,041
I'm on my way now.

00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,583

ORIGINAL STORY BY ABIKO SAMEJIMA

129
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,750
There's my bro.

130
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,291
He looks so cool!

131
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,375
Miss Akane and Loli-senpai, too.

132
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,166
Senpai looks like a different person.

133
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,875
She's such a pro.

134
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,583
The face of an actress.

135
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,833
TOKYO BLADE

136
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,625
Awesome.

NOW TRENDING
TOKYO BLADE, LIVE ACTION, TOBURE

138
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,708
Tokyo Blade and Tobure
are both trending keywords.

139
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:53,916
This golden time slot rocks.
The Internet's exploding.

140
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
That was close.

141
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:08,833
First time I ever delivered a show
30 minutes before it aired.

142
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,125
Not to mention airing one
with no next week preview.

143
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,958
The first episode safely scored
double-digit ratings.

144
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,833
The dramatization of Tokyo Blade
was off to a good start.

145
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,291
Or so it appeared.

146
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,833
Episode 2 got 6.8 percent.

147
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,291
Episode 3 only 5.1 percent.

148
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,083
Episode 4 down to 4.3 percent.

149
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,250
How does a show based on a hit
comic get such low numbers?

150
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,791
My apologies.

151
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,375
Individual ratings suck eggs, too.

152
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,958
The F2 demographic in particular.

153
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:03,416
But streaming's strong, and the story
picks up from Episode 5.

154
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,666
The screenplay is just too edgy.

155
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,833
Do you understand?

156
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:13,125
This is the "golden hour" on
terrestrial airwaves.

157
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,625
The coveted 9 p.m. time slot.

158
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,875
My apologies.

159
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,458
Give me a break.

160
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,375
At any rate, I want more romance.

161
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,250
And pretty boy closeups.

162
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,791
But the work's world view...

163
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,458
World view be damned!

164
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,000
A TV drama

165
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,916
must get the women and children.

166
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,333
Mind the compliance and budget, too.

167
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,458
If ratings drop any further,

168
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,500
cancellation isn't out of the question.

169
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,458
I HAD HIGH HOPES
FOR THE TOKYO BLADE DRAMA,

170
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,541
WHAT A SHAME.

171
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,500
The numbers aren't looking
too good, I'm afraid.

172
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,083
I see.

173
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,083
Any idea what might be causing the drop?

174
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,250
Maybe we've taken too much time
on the set up.

175
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,125
The set up?

176
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,583
Yeah, on introducing the characters
and establishing the premise.

177
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,125
The deeper you go with the set up,

178
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,250
the longer it takes to get around
to the story.

179
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,500
But it really takes off after Episode 5.

180
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,041
Instead of knee-jerk changes,

181
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,458
just stay the course.

182
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,583
Understood.

183
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,708
Sorry, I'm wanted somewhere.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

184
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,125
Is staying the course the best option?

185
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:05,291
Do you have any qualms about
what we've got so far?

186
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,833
I think it's a wonderful drama.

187
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,083
But I'm worried.

188
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,541
Should we try to make it more accessible?

189
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,916
The luxury to write freely

190
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,791
comes only when the schedule's
too tight for editing.

191
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,291
We shoot what's on the page.

192
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,625
We don't have to listen to those
who don't get it.

193
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,958
I agree that we stick to our guns.

194
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,708
That's the producer's decision.

195
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,833
It's our job to comply.

196
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,708
Let's put our faith in Mr. Raida

197
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,458
and double down on the rest.

198
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,916
Okay.

199
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,250
Shall we take that break now?

200
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,583
How about we regroup in ten minutes?

201
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,125
"Should we make it more accessible?"

202
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,916
I sense weakness in our fearless writer.

203
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,541
If you're losing support in your work,

204
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,416
it's only natural for a creator
to respond.

205
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,958
I remember when your serial first started.

206
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:32,125
Weak early reviews made you
curry favor with readers.

207
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,625
Excuse me?

208
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,125
It's only going to intensify.

209
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:44,333
Have faith in the strength of your work.

210
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,125
Let's head up.

211
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,625
We're taking wide shots first.

212
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,875
You set the timing.

213
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,875
Got it.

214
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,208
Hello.

215
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,416
Hey.

216
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:34,041
Do you mind not glaring at me
every time we're together?

217
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm not glaring.

218
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,625
Unlike everyone else, I get the stink eye.

219
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,291
Must be a symptom of your self-importance.

220
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,958
Say what?

221
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,000
Personally, I grow weary of the

222
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,833
"Bow to the child prodigy" act.

223
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,125
Stop clinging to the past. Seize the day.

224
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:00,125
Oh, now the truth finally comes out.

225
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
So...

226
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:07,208
You must really hate my guts,
which seems odd for someone...

227
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,750
heralded as "Best young acting genius,"

228
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,583
Akane Kurokawa!

229
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,458
KANA ARIMA'S MY ASPIRATION

230
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,541
Huh?

231
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,666
What's this?

232
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,625
"Kana Arima's my aspiration"?

233
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,291
"I want to be like Kana Arima."

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,875
"So I entered the Kids Repertory Theater"?

235
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,750
Why didn't you tell me?

236
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,041
Had I known you loved me that much,

237
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,875
I would've given you an autograph.

238
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,000
Who showed her that? Someone at Lala Lai?

239
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,500
Me. Sorry.

240
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,541
Mr. Himekawa.

241
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,708
Check this out, Aqua. It's hilarious.

242
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,166
Stop milking it.

243
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,875
It's true. There was a time when
I admired you.

244
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,875
Then I met the real you.

245
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,166
A conceited brat who makes fun of people.

246
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,833
Security, crazy fan in the house!

247
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:12,916
Like hell!

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,250
Mr. Himekawa, Ms. Arima, wanted on set!

249
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,333
Coming.

250
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,583
Later, fangirl.

251
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,625
Ah, that was such fun.

252
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,708
Hang tough.

253
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,166
THEATER ERA MAGAZINE

254
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,625
Places please, everybody!

255
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,416
Okay!

256
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,583
-Places!
-Places everyone!

257
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,750
-One sec please.
-Okay.

258
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,916
And action.

259
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,541
Kento!

260
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,583
Me and Akane...

261
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,041
approach acting very differently.

262
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,833
So our definitions of good acting

263
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,083
will naturally take different forms.

264
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,333
But from you, I get a certain vibe

265
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,666
that says, "Mine is the right way.
Yours is wrong."

266
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,666
It really irks me to no end.

267
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,583
Thank God you're safe.

268
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,833
To be sure, you do have special
acting talent...

269
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,583
on your own level.

270
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,875
But I...

271
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:16,666
have a burning passion for performance.

272
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,125
-Cut!
-Cut.

273
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,583
-Okay.
-Okay.

274
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,333
Moving on.

275
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,291
Wow, that was superb.

276
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,166
-You okay? Cold?
-Yes, thank you.

277
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,750
-Bring a heater!
-Coming.

278
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,625
At this rate, those two will devour us.

279
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,708
They did.

280
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,166
We're being played by an imposter.

281
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,541
Himekawa and Arima's seminal scene
from the manga went viral.

282
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,250
Thank God you're safe.

283
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,291
Doing great, Mr. Raida.

284
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,625
Thanks.

285
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,541
Tokyo Blade ratings started creeping up,

286
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,625
finally hitting double digits again
by Episode 9.

287
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:14,458
It set a record for the number of viewers
watching after airing.

288
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,041
Senpai, you're all over the Internet.

289
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:24,583
"Ex-child actor Kana Arima
on the verge of a comeback!"

290
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:31,000
What sadist schedules dance lessons
on my first break in two months?

291
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,708
Ichigo Production's boss does.

292
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,916
This is B-Komachi's big PR window, Boss.

293
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,916
Let's write a new song!

294
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,625
Yeah, Boss!

295
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,250
Once Kana's done shooting,
let's record it.

296
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,625
Yeah, Boss!

297
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:51,500
Actually, I've already ordered a new song.

298
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,166
-That's our boss!
-Since when?

299
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,791
To be produced by...

300
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,333
none other than Mr. Himura.

301
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:06,416
The guy who wrote B-Komachi's
big hit, "Star Train"?

302
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,750
That's right.

303
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:12,541
But I've yet to see even a demo
after more than a month.

304
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,541
We're being taken lightly.

305
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,416
Veterans never meet deadlines.

306
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,333
We'll just have to wait.

307
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,833
I can't wait. Pressure him to finish.

308
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,291
Yeah, Boss.

309
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,000
He's a busy man. I can't force him.

310
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:32,791
He's making an exception
out of past gratitude.

311
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,375
I don't care. Call him now.

312
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,458
Call him!

313
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:41,125
What's the hurry? It's not like
we announced a release.

314
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,625
I'll just pressure him directly.

315
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,958
Oh come on now, Ruby.

316
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,458
-Thank you.
-Good night.

317
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,166
-Good night.
-Thank you.

318
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,666
You've been leaving alone a lot lately.

319
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,750
Where do you go?

320
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,416
The mama boy's house.

321
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,916
What we want, Mr. Himura

322
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,958
is your emo rock.

323
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,416
You got it.

324
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,916
That Himura-esque jangly riff.

325
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:28,666
Mr. Himura.

326
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,875
I'm B-Komachi's Ruby Hoshino.

327
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,958
From Ichigo.

328
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:37,541
I'm so pumped to do your song,
I had to come.

329
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:44,000
When will you finish our new single.

330
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,791
The deadline was last month.

331
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,208
I've been pretty swamped.
End of the month?

332
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,375
Please.

333
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,916
I'm not getting any younger.

334
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,916
An idol's time to shine is limited.

335
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,541
We're running at full tilt right now.

336
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:16,166
I'm super excited to hear your song.

337
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,708
Your cooperation is most appreciated.

338
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,958
Excuse me.

339
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,291
What? Did she say B-Komachi?

340
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,333
They're a rip-off version.

341
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:52,458
Okay, I guess I'll write a masterpiece.

342
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:55,875
But Mr. Himura, what about our song?

343
00:26:55,958 --> 00:27:01,125
You can't dictate where and when
the creative spark will be lit.

344
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,458
If you want a song, then light my fire.

345
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,708
Mr. Himura, our song takes priority!

346
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,291
What do you think?

347
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,458
I think it's a great finale.

348
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,708
I completely agree.

349
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,375
Are you ready to press "Send"?

350
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,833
No, let me check it one last time.

351
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:37,833
I've made so many demands,
any flop will be on me.

352
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,583
It's time you stopped doing that.

353
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:51,958
Certainly, a screenplay can impact
the overall quality of a TV drama.

354
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:55,500
But it's not everything.

355
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:59,916
A lot of people are involved
in its creation.

356
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,958
We've done our part by writing
a screenplay we're proud of.

357
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,458
Now it's up to the staff on set
to do the rest.

358
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,166
Okay.

359
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,833
Let me send it to Mr. Raida.

360
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,416
Listen...

361
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,708
What?

362
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:32,500
Several years ago, I watched
your Thief of 20 Faces.

363
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,166
Thief of 20 Faces.

364
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,041
Wait, how did you know I wrote that?

365
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,291
Mr. Raida told me.

366
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,708
I see.

367
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:52,041
Your version of it was my
absolute all-time favorite.

368
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,625
Thank you.

369
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:02,458
I may not look it,
but I'm a pretty good writer.

370
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:16,416
SIX DAYS TO FINAL EPISODE AIRING

371
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,958
TOKYO BLADE

372
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:24,166
It figures. Another high hurdle script.

373
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:28,458
TOKYO BLADE- NO. 1 IN ALL TIME
IN NUMBER OF VIEWS AFTER AIRING

374
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,625
B-KOMACHI HIMURA DEMO

375
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,250
Oh my God. It's awesome.

376
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,541
Goosebumps.

377
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:45,125
Mr. Himura's a genius.
I can't wait to record it.

378
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,208
When does Kana's shoot end?

379
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,458
Tomorrow.

380
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,333
That means we have the weekend.

381
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,250
-I'm back.
-Welcome home.

382
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,333
Welcome home.

383
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:58,166
Guess what, Aqua? Our new song arrived.

384
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,791
-It's amazing. Come listen.
-Yeah.

385
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,625
Aqua, this came.

386
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,666
Thanks.

387
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,333
Wait, Aqua! Aren't you gonna listen?

388
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:20,250
Boss, now that we have a single,
can we make a music video?

389
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,791
Yes, let's think of some steps.

390
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:26,416
Out of the question. There's no budget.

391
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,916
Don't worry. I have a video artist
friend who'll give us a cut rate.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,250
Mem-cho, you're a networking goddess.

393
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,500
The only catch is we'd have to film it

394
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,541
in the boonies where her company is.

395
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,416
How "boonies"?

396
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:45,041
Miyazaki.

397
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,500
Miyazaki, huh?

398
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:50,708
What's it famous for?

399
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,083
Mangos?

400
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,333
Clean, clean...

401
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:05,166
clean, clean, clean.

402
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,791
Clean.

403
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:19,583
ONE DAY TO FINAL EPISODE AIRING

404
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,666
-Director...Director.
-What?

405
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,916
-We can't skip any shots today.
-Yes, I know.

406
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,583
It must go to post by 10 p.m.

407
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,875
Okay, stop pestering. Get a move on!

408
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,416
-Come on.
-Yes, sir!

409
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,583
Thank you.

410
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,750
You're kidding.

411
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,791
Rolling!

412
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,916
Rolling.

413
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,750
And action!

414
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:07,041
The finale features a festival
to enshrine a cursed sword.

415
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,958
It serves as the climactic scene.

416
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,958
I decided to become an actress

417
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,416
so I could be like you.

418
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:50,666
You promised me that papa
would come back home!

419
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,708
"Look at me!"

420
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,416
That line she delivered with body

421
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,875
and soul left me spellbound.

422
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,833
Numbers 22 and 23, your turns to audition.

423
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,375
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you...

424
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,125
Thank you.

425
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,041
Miss Arima's arrived.

426
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,208
And your favorite food, Kana?

427
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,375
Baumkuchen.

428
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:18,041
-Me, too. We'll bring some next time.
-Thanks.

429
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,833
You're so cute, Kana. Red is your color.

430
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,250
Kana-chan!

431
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,208
I never miss you on TV.

432
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,666
-Who's that?
-Auditioner.

433
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,083
You may have ignored me...

434
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,416
MAIN : KANA ARIMA
KID 1 : AKANE KUROKAWA

435
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
or took roles away from me.

436
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,916
-But my admiration never waned.
-Adorable!

437
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,833
Can you do it again?

438
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,916
I'm here because you existed.

439
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:53,083
And now we're in the same ring together.

440
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,583
I've waited for this all my life...

441
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,291
to stand theatrically toe-to-toe.

442
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,791
Watch me. Because now it's my turn.

443
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,458
This time, I'm gonna win, Kana-chan.

444
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,166
Himekawa's and Arima's characters

445
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,833
have closed in on the true culprit
of the serial murders.

446
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,958
The mastermind turns out to be
Akane's character, Saya.

447
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:32,541
My character learns of this

448
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,166
and arrives to save Saya.

449
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,708
But Saya, in despair, has taken her life.

450
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,083
The climactic scene...

451
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:49,125
has me cradling her blood-soaked body,
and wailing.

452
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,291
Do you really enjoy acting?

453
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:01,625
Because when you're deep in your role,

454
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,541
it looks excruciatingly painful.

455
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:07,666
Just like me.

456
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:12,208
Five minutes. Places please.

457
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:47,166
Your trigger is your guilt.

458
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,416
My guilt?

459
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:56,166
When you're absorbed in your acting
and it resonates...

460
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,416
that's when you feel most alive.

461
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,500
And hence, the panic attacks.

462
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:08,833
It tells me that you love acting
more than you imagine.

463
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,000
When this shoot is over,

464
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:18,000
step away from showbiz and get treatment.

465
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,708
Truth is...

466
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,583
I don't care what happens to me.

467
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,625
What's more...

468
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,916
acting for me is merely a means to an end.

469
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,125
I've known you a long time.

470
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:51,041
The true reason you're in this business
isn't hard for me to surmise.

471
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,083
But...

472
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,708
don't torture yourself.

473
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,291
I'll use anything at my disposal
to make up for my lack of talent.

474
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,666
That's my way.

475
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,916
Dear Ai...

476
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,916
I seethe with anger and regret.

477
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,041
With paralyzing grief and vengefulness.

478
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,916
This feels right.

479
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:42,208
For me, acting is my means for revenge.

480
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,041
Visually, it works. Let's go with it.

481
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,416
-Let's go with it.
-Yes.

482
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,083
You okay? You're sweating.

483
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,583
I'm okay.

484
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,583
We've got 15 minutes.

485
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:02,541
Okay, I know! Let's roll, people.
Let's do this.

486
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,416
-Let's start!
-Attention everyone.

487
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,250
We're out of time.

488
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:10,625
No test takes, no mistakes.
Just give it your all.

489
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,083
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

490
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,375
Rolling!

491
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,750
Ready...

492
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,041
action!

493
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,250
I found myself helpless to do anything.

494
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,625
It's not your fault.

495
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,958
Promise me...

496
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,083
you won't blame yourself.

497
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:35,625
I'm sorry.

498
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,333
I'm sorry.

499
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,000
I couldn't be by your side.

500
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,416
I sure wish I could have been with you...

501
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,333
No. Open your eyes.

502
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,125
Cut! Okay!

503
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,041
-Okay!
-Okay.

504
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,333
Go on to post. A car's waiting.

505
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:38,791
Got it.

506
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,000
See you later.

507
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,708
Mr. Raida, the tape.

508
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,791
-Thanks.
-B cam?

509
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,250
-Getting it now.
-Thanks.

510
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,458
Good job.

511
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,875
Well done.

512
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:02,541
Kana-chan.

513
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,125
I'm so grateful you stepped in to help.

514
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,291
Your acting was top-notch.

515
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:16,833
Once a prodigy, always a prodigy, I guess.

516
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,833
Not at all.

517
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,583
Here it is, Mr. Raida.

518
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,375
Thank you. Good work.

519
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,416
See you at the party.

520
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:44,958
A true genius is recognizable at a glance.

521
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,458
All I've done...

522
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,750
is reach desperately for it.

523
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,958
Good work.

524
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:01,916
Thank you. Till next time.

525
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,833
Congrats.

526
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,416
I'm a minor.

527
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,333
I'm kidding.

528
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,458
Do you have time later?

529
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:28,041
Sorry, I've got a date with a woman.

530
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,833
What's that?

531
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:50,916
AQUAMARINE HOSHINO AND TAIKI HIMEKAWA
HALF-SIBLINGS BY SAME FATHER, 99.9981%.

532
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,916
I was wondering...

533
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:58,916
if you'd tell me...

534
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:02,416
about our father.

535
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,708
THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION

536
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,750
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
ARE FICTITIOUS
