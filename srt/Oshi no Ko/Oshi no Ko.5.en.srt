1
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,875
Rewrite the entire script.

2
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:36,750
Hold on. We got your approval,
so we've prepared based on that.

3
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:42,291
I tentatively approved pending
the actors' performance.

4
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,333
But I wasn't convinced,
so I want it rewritten.

5
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,750
But…

6
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,458
Sensei, we start shooting in two days.

7
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:55,041
Isn't a full rewrite a bit impractical?

8
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,916
Isn't the script the soul of a TV drama?

9
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:06,083
Manga, too. The good ones are good
before they're ever drawn.

10
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:12,250
Even the best cast and crew
can't save a poorly written script.

11
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:16,750
-Abiko Sensei.
-Did you even read the manga, I wonder?

12
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,916
Of course. I was a huge fan
before signing on.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,125
From the very first Weekly Champ episode.

14
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,583
And this is the result?

15
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,166
You can change the story,

16
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,291
but altering the characters is insulting.

17
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:50,333
With all due respect, live action
differs from 2D comics.

18
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:54,458
Adapting the visuals to real life
requires changes.

19
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:58,958
Changes, yes, but these completely
miss the point.

20
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,291
Like a critical scene with the hero.

21
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,500
You have the heroine emoting
like a blithering idiot.

22
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,541
My characters aren't this stupid!

23
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,000
You call yourself a screenwriter?

24
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,458
Abiko Sensei, please.

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,750
It's clear my abilities are inadequate.

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,916
Forgive me.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,291
Um…

28
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:34,875
No need to apologize. Keep your name
in the credits and get paid.

29
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,000
But I don't want you anywhere
near the script.

30
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,666
I'll rewrite the whole thing myself.

31
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,708
Or I withhold the rights.

32
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,000
Sensei.

33
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,791
-Hey.
-Sensei, wait!

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,166
I'm so sorry about this. Sensei!

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,583
You went a bit too far back there.
In front of everyone, too.

36
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,333
Why be insulting?

37
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,041
That hack writer is insulting.

38
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,208
Look, I know the urge to push back.

39
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,000
But you gave your approval.

40
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,833
Some compromise is inevitable.

41
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:26,208
Nobody's trying to ruin your work.
You must be flexible.

42
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,416
Must I really?

43
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:34,708
Let your children go.
Leave them in the care of professionals.

44
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,833
Like you did with Today Sweet?
Where did that leave you?

45
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,791
I hated seeing how they defiled
your masterpiece.

46
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,083
I owe it to my readers not to do that.

47
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,625
Sensei! Excuse me.

48
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,000
What do we do now, Mr. Raida?

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,375
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,833
We've no choice but to delay the shoot.

51
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:22,750
I'll try to convince the publisher
to let us shoot to Episode 3.

52
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:28,291
At the very least, we can't leave
a gaping hole in the time slot.

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,875
Make sure all the agencies are on board.

54
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
I've got an appointment.

55
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,791
-Thank you.
-See you later.

56
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,875
Easy for a no-show TV station producer
to say.

57
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,250
Like we care about his admin agenda.

58
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,500
He'll blame us for a failure.

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,333
Yet take all the credit for success.

60
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,166
He's a win-lose guy.

61
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,541
Crunch numbers and leave us alone.

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,208
He comes from a golden age of TV.

63
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,916
I'm sorry for not coming through.

64
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,583
Are you kidding? You've been great, Goa.

65
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,875
I think this is an amazing script.

66
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,791
Thank you.

67
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:29,708
Now with the extra time,
I'd love to improve it.

68
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,083
But not if it means losing the rights.

69
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,041
I'll chalk it up to bad luck

70
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,916
and excuse myself.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,916
Don't say that, Goa.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,375
If it'll fix things,
it's the right thing to do.

73
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,500
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:57,541
Oh, but of course, I expect to be paid
for work to this point.

75
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:03,000
But please remove my name
from the credits.

76
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:09,250
I do have my pride as a scriptwriter
to live with.

77
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm truly sorry.

78
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,166
15-MINUTE EXTENDED SPECIAL

79
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,541
Things have turned into quite a mess.

80
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,375
To be sure.

81
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,166
But they did cut most of our
childhood backstory.

82
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:46,333
I loved that scene where the twins
say they're Amaterasu incarnate.

83
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:50,916
No child actor can handle
such fast-paced dialogue.

84
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,166
Not to mention an infant dancing.

85
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,625
Even CG would be hard.

86
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:01,625
It's virtually impossible to take
a highly stylized manga

87
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,875
and expect real life, human actors
to pull it off.

88
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:11,083
Well, I love the manga, too.
So I fear fan wrath.

89
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, there will be haters for sure.

90
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,083
That's a given.

91
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:21,375
But why did Abiko Sensei
wait till now to complain?

92
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:25,041
She surely could've said something sooner.

93
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:31,041
The author doesn't get to see
the screenplay until it's taken shape.

94
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,541
So she wasn't allowed to give her input?

95
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:40,083
No, she can express opinions
and make suggestions.

96
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,916
But those never go directly
to the screenwriter's ears.

97
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,666
They filter through editor, publisher,

98
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:55,541
and then producer, like a
message relay game.

99
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,500
Each has their own interests at stake.

100
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,333
That created a lot of stress for her.

101
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:11,958
The author and screenwriter both
have their own priorities.

102
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:17,291
The question is how to reconcile
those when they clash.

103
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,833
Makes sense.

104
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,875
Plus, it's a tight schedule.

105
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,666
This is where Producer Raida must shine.

106
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,791
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL GRAPHIC NOVEL
OSHI NO KO

107
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,458
BY AKA AKASAKA × MENGO YOKOYARI,
PUBLISHED BY SHUEISHA

108
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,458
Abiko Sensei turns a deaf ear to advice.

109
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:09,750
Isn't it the job of her editor
to convince her to listen?

110
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,125
You see, that's the problem.

111
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,416
She keeps firing her assistants.

112
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:20,000
And now she's taking a month off
to pen a screenplay.

113
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,458
She'll never make it.

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,166
One month to write ten,
hour-long TV drama episodes?

115
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,708
Nicely done.

116
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,750
It's really coming along.

117
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,708
Three songs in a row is killer.

118
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,708
I'm so spent right now.

119
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,625
Wimps. On stage, we do five songs
with a minute break.

120
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,125
Suck it up.

121
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,458
How are you such a stamina queen?

122
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,625
I've run each morning and night
for three years.

123
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,875
I'm simply way fitter than you.

124
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,000
And modest.

125
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:27,125
Tomorrow is the new B-Komachi's
first live gig.

126
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,625
Rest up so we can make a splash, okay?

127
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,333
Okay.

128
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,958
Can you believe we're making
our idol debut?

129
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,041
What do I do, Senpai? I'm so nervous.

130
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,541
Stop talking and go to sleep.

131
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:06,541
I'm too excited to sleep.
Aren't you excited, Senpai?

132
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,041
Not in the least.

133
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Why not?

134
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,208
I've no idea how the audience will react.

135
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,916
What do you mean?

136
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:27,708
We got here by connections.
What if they boo us off the stage?

137
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,625
Or maybe no one will show up,
and we'll hear crickets.

138
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,708
As I see it,

139
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:42,166
it's hard for me to even fathom
how you can be so positive.

140
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,416
That's simple.

141
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,875
Becoming an idol is my dream.

142
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,000
There was a time

143
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:08,291
when I was barely able to go outside.

144
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,166
I had no dreams or hope for the future.

145
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,625
I expected to just quietly die.

146
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,458
And that would be that.

147
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,791
But then…

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,291
I saw B-Komachi on television.

149
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,750
They made each day exciting
and worth waking up for.

150
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,375
I could hardly contain my fandom.

151
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:45,625
And then one day, I met someone.

152
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,500
And who was that?

153
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
My first crush.

154
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,708
Sounds bittersweet.

155
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,791
I'll never forget his words.

156
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:09,500
He said if I ever became an idol,
he'd make me his fave for life.

157
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:17,625
From that moment forward,
my dream was to become an idol.

158
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,333
So where is that person now?

159
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,875
I don't know.

160
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:34,541
But I know he'll respond to hearing
the name B-Komachi again.

161
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:40,833
And if I ever make it as an idol,
he'll surely come and find me.

162
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,791
Who knows? He may even show up
at the event tomorrow.

163
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:51,166
It must be nice to have a devoted fan.

164
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,458
I don't have anyone like that.

165
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:03,458
People still just see the bratty
child actor. They don't see me now.

166
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,708
Carefree girl.

167
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll see you at the Japan Idol Fest.

168
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,333
I can't wait.

169
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,291
Japan Idol Fest!

170
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,250
Please come see us!

171
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,458
We’re doing a free campaign!

172
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,416
Please take one!

173
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,875
We're here! The Japan Idol Festival 2023!

174
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,375
Someone's pumped.

175
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,625
Better believe it.

176
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,958
I ended up not sleeping a wink.

177
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,583
So many cute girls.

178
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,625
But don't let that stop you.

179
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,541
Why? Aren't I cute enough?

180
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,125
-Passably.
-Passably? How mean.

181
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,125
Nice to meet you.

182
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,291
It's so much bigger than I imagined.

183
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:39,041
You're on the smallest of three stages
reserved for newbies.

184
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,041
I want the main stage.

185
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,541
Now you're getting greedy.

186
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,250
-Let's go backstage.
-Let's.

187
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,666
What's wrong, Kana?

188
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,000
Nothing.

189
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,583
Shall we?

190
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,666
Wow.

191
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,750
Where's our dressing room?

192
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,500
Probably farther back?

193
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,875
This place is packed.

194
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,875
Multi-stage festivals are like this.

195
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:26,166
Hundreds of performers just
crammed in with staff.

196
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
Standing room only.

197
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,791
Where do we change?

198
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,125
DRESSING ROOM

199
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,958
-We're to change behind that?
-Yup.

200
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,791
This is pretty chaotic.

201
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:46,541
Of course, the main stage acts
get their own dressing rooms.

202
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:52,791
But for all you other garden variety
idols, this is what you get.

203
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,958
If you want the royal treatment,
earn it, right?

204
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,833
Exactly.

205
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,208
-Pose like this?
-Pose!

206
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,541
Why do you eat rice and bread?

207
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,833
Yummy.

208
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,375
How can you eat a bento
at a time like this?

209
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,416
-Can't fight on an empty stomach.
-Exactly.

210
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,208
Eat while you have the chance.

211
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,458
Thanks, but no thanks. I have no appetite.

212
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,083
Don't tell me you're nervous.

213
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:49,041
Don't be silly. I've been in this biz
since I sucked a bottle.

214
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,000
Why would I get nervous now?

215
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,541
Fine, at least put something
in your belly.

216
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,000
And you two should be more nervous.

217
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,541
You're too calm. Give me some spirit.

218
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,916
Mm, good.

219
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,416
Where are you going?

220
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,500
To find a bathroom.

221
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,375
Don't be scared. Get pumped.

222
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:35,458
Use your 17 years of experience
to lead those two amateurs.

223
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,958
To lead.

224
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:50,541
Why me? An ex-child actor
on the downside of her career?

225
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,333
KANA ARIMA
CD HAND OUT EVENT

226
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,541
Thank you so much.

227
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,833
I recall the sighs,
the looks of disappointment.

228
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,750
Sorry I grew up.

229
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,500
When did it start?

230
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,333
The self-deprecating remarks
I felt I had to make.

231
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,333
It's a bit early, but let's wrap this up.

232
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,416
The misery of not living up
to expectations

233
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,833
is hard to put into words.

234
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,833
I must not allow

235
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,750
those two girls to experience that.

236
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,416
It's up to me

237
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,875
to come through for them.

238
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,625
How's it coming?

239
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:16,500
I must say, I'm excited to have
the author writing the screenplay.

240
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,833
Sensei,

241
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,708
may I speak frankly?

242
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,708
The truth is…

243
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,208
I'm in a very weak spot.

244
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,500
You have the legal right
to ensure the integrity

245
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,041
of your copyrighted property.

246
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:49,458
It forbids anyone from altering
the title or contents

247
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,125
without the author's permission.

248
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:57,500
In short, we cannot produce
Tokyo Blade in its current form

249
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,125
without your expressed approval.

250
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,708
And we won't.

251
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:08,166
This "right to personal identity"
is exercised by you the author.

252
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,750
So I want to ask you to consider this.

253
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,375
What?

254
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,625
It's quite possible…

255
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,750
that we will follow
your screenplay verbatim.

256
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,500
That's what I wanted all along.

257
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,250
This is your first screenplay, is it not?

258
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,625
Yes, so what?

259
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,125
Do you think a brilliant novelist

260
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,375
would at first attempt be able to
write a brilliant manga?

261
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,791
No. It's totally different.

262
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,583
Same for screenplays.

263
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,791
Even a manga genius can't instantly
write a genius script.

264
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,666
Not for a first effort while under
time constraints.

265
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,500
The TV serialization of Tokyo Blade

266
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:06,625
is not likely to turn out
the way you imagined.

267
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:12,916
You said yourself, the soul
of a TV drama is its script.

268
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:18,666
I'm so terribly sorry. Are you all right?

269
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,458
Is that a threat?

270
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,833
It takes two to tango.

271
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,750
You threatened to pull the rights.

272
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm accustomed to working
in conditions even tougher than this.

273
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:44,833
As a producer, I'm responsible for
the work of over 100 cast and crew.

274
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,750
On their behalf,

275
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,750
I'm prepared to endure
any shitstorm thrown my way.

276
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:05,291
You once posted a glowing comment online

277
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:11,125
about a special TV movie called
The Thief with 20 Faces.

278
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:16,500
You called the screenplay
"better than the original."

279
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:22,208
What? Are you saying you plan to
bring that writer on?

280
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:26,250
That was penned by Goa
following his debut.

281
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,208
He ghost wrote it from scratch.

282
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm asking you to give him a shot.
Put your trust in him.

283
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,958
I will under one condition.

284
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,541
All together!

285
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,541
Right.

286
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,208
Where'd Mem-cho go?

287
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:22,083
Bathroom. Upset stomach, she said.

288
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,166
Oh.

289
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,083
What's wrong?

290
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,875
I've suddenly become very nervous.

291
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:38,333
What? You were casually stuffing
your face a few minutes ago.

292
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,125
But once in costume…

293
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:45,041
the fear of standing on stage
started to creep up.

294
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:55,083
Well, it won't do any good to start
freaking out now. Steel yourself.

295
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,833
You're not scared, Senpai?

296
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:08,458
Of course not.
You're looking at a seasoned pro.

297
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:14,416
Liar. Your hands are freezing.

298
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:21,833
The truth is you're nervous, too, right?

299
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:30,333
Don't be stupid. I haven't fallen
as far as you think.

300
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,000
No, I'm relieved.

301
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:38,916
I feel a bit better knowing
you're as nervous as I am.

302
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,041
Or maybe…

303
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,500
you're seriously petrified?

304
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:56,041
Don't worry. We're all in this together.

305
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,916
That's what's scary.

306
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,291
What?

307
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:08,083
I wouldn't give a damn
if I were going on stage alone.

308
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:15,500
I've made a fool of myself in public
more often than I care to count.

309
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,666
But this is different.

310
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,875
You two are here.

311
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,541
I can't allow us to fail.

312
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,166
It would kill me if you…

313
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,708
tasted the misery I have.

314
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,708
We're not your responsibility.

315
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,708
I don't know what sort of career
you've had.

316
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:48,500
But to me, you're just a little girl.

317
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:53,708
You're a rookie idol no different
than the rest.

318
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:01,208
You're cute as a button
and work harder than anyone.

319
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:09,500
If we fall flat on our faces,
then let's have fun doing it.

320
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,666
B-Komachi, you're up next.

321
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,000
Got it. Come on, let's go.

322
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:20,500
Thank you for your support!

323
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,625
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

324
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,916
Sorry I'm late.

325
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,375
Let's kick butt, okay?

326
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,166
-A.
-B.

327
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,375
C.

328
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,291
One too far.

329
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,541
B-Komachi!

330
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,083
You're on next. Get ready.

331
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,208
Good luck.

332
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,000
JAPAN IDOL FESTIVAL 2023

333
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,208
There's no turning back now.

334
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,625
Most of the spectators were there
for Mem-cho.

335
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,666
Maybe they would've been happier
with her in Center.

336
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,375
Ruby really shines.

337
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:14,666
She truly loves idols, and seems like
she was born to be one.

338
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:20,041
Will this moment win someone's heart?

339
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:23,916
Will fans start flocking to her?

340
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,208
I envy these two next to me.

341
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,208
I envy them so much.

342
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:37,500
Being seen by everybody,
desired by everybody.

343
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,458
Not me.

344
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,541
Nobody's looking at me.

345
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,250
"Somebody, see me."

346
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,083
"Say you need me."

347
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:56,500
That's what I've been shouting
all this time.

348
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,250
Tell me "You did good."

349
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,291
Tell me "It's okay to be here."

350
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,625
I'm begging you…

351
00:31:09,291 --> 00:31:12,833
somebody, please…

352
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:27,958
What's this?

353
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,375
What the hell is he doing?

354
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,666
He's so infuriating.

355
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,791
That settles it.

356
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,791
I promise to turn all of your light sticks
into pure white.

357
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,041
I'm going to make you love me.

358
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,291
I'm going to become your fave!

359
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,958
CAFE RESTAURANT GUSTO

360
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,250
Well?

361
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,458
Well what?

362
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,166
Our performance, what else?

363
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:32,291
It was good for a first effort.

364
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,291
Can't you be more complimentary?

365
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,125
No, I can't.

366
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,708
Why not?

367
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,750
Because B-Komachi will be doing
a lot more shows.

368
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,541
I need to save my high marks.

369
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,791
I see.

370
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:55,875
Oh, I got a call from that producer,
Mr. Raida.

371
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,125
And?

372
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,541
Shooting starts in two days.

373
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:04,791
Episode 1 will be slightly revised.
After that, it's a clean wipe.

374
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,625
What? Did you get another job?

375
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:12,125
Tokyo Blade, the TV drama.
Mondays at nine.

376
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,500
Isn't Akane Kurokawa appearing, too?

377
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:20,625
That reminds me. How're you two
getting along?

378
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:27,666
Fine. We've just been meeting up
to post Instagram photos together.

379
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,291
Oh, just PR.

380
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:37,000
She's too popular now to be
serious about you for real.

381
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,208
It must be hard work
keeping up appearances.

382
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,958
What a power couple.

383
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,666
Keep it up.

384
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,458
FUJIMI TELEVISION

385
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,125
Interesting.

386
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:59,791
So we share the script in real time
and make changes on the fly?

387
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,458
It's the furthest I can stretch
as a producer.

388
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,375
Oh, and Abiko Sensei,

389
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:10,583
let us lock down the slug lines
in episodes 1-3.

390
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,541
Slug lines?

391
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:19,375
The columns that describe the time
and setting per scene.

392
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:23,583
If we delay the shoot further
or add locations,

393
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,458
we won't enough have prep time.

394
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,500
Understood.

395
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,916
Then are we ready to start?

396
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,291
TOKYO BLADE

397
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,250
How's it going?

398
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:07,333
I hear the Tokyo Blade author
is writing the script herself.

399
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,291
That's right.

400
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:14,583
We finally printed the revised,
sanctioned version of Episode 1.

401
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,166
When do you shoot?

402
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,208
Tomorrow.

403
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,375
Seriously?

404
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,708
Seriously.

405
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,583
Got the script?

406
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:33,375
It just arrived.

407
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,166
I can't learn this in a day.

408
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,708
I know. This production's a hot mess.

409
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,750
So what do you think?

410
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,541
It's got a very different vibe.

411
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:48,500
I like it better. More of Mr. Goa's touch.

412
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:53,458
But it puts more pressure on the actors
to act their butts off.

413
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,958
I bet everyone's racking their brains.

414
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,625
That makes it more worthwhile.

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,208
If you need any acting advice, I'm here.

416
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,916
It's my turn to save you this time, Aqua.

417
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:14,833
We will now…

418
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,916
At long last, the drama Tokyo Blade

419
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,458
had its first day of shooting.

420
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,041
Let me introduce the cast.

421
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,875
Taiki Himekawa as Kento.

422
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,458
-Welcome.
-Excited to work with you.

423
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,416
Akane Kurokawa as Saya.

424
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,333
-How do you do?
-Welcome.

425
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:36,875
Aqua Hoshino as Toma.

426
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,375
-Pleasure.
-Our pleasure.

427
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,916
Welcome. And Sakuya Kamoshida as Hamon.

428
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,083
I'm so sorry.

429
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:51,458
Yes, Episode 2 revisions will be
coming momentarily.

430
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:55,916
I apologize for any trouble
caused by the delay.

431
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,291
Of course.

432
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,291
Man, give a guy a break.

433
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:10,458
-If it feels dangerous, jump on here.
-Understood.

434
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:14,750
He's back. Mr. Raida…

435
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,166
what's the latest on Mr. Goa's script?
Any news?

436
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,583
Um, well…

437
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,958
When do we get Episode 2?

438
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,375
Locations take time.

439
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,833
I need it to make a schedule.

440
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,458
It'll be fine. Relax.

441
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,208
Producer Koshimizu.

442
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,500
-Hello, Raida here.
-Don't let us down.

443
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,500
-What?
-I know his job's not easy.

444
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,041
What!

445
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,208
Hello.

446
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,250
Hey.

447
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,333
Is something wrong?

448
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:07,375
The actress playing Tsurugi
has dropped out.

449
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:12,875
Tore her Achilles during rehearsal.

450
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,333
Three months to heal.

451
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,958
First, a full rewrite two days
before shooting.

452
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:31,250
Then on Day One,
a main cast member leaves.

453
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,208
With this much bad luck,

454
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,666
one can only laugh.

455
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,791
Now Mr. Koshimizu says,

456
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,791
"Find a sub with some name value."

457
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Where am I gonna find a young actress
who can hold a lead role now?

458
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,875
From my agency.

459
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,125
She's got some name value,

460
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,791
prime acting chops

461
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,333
and isn't working.

462
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,250
Kana Arima as Tsurugi.

463
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,458
I'm Kana Arima. I'm glad to be here.

464
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,708
Welcome.

465
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,458
Next we have Mako Azami.

466
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,458
Am I a woman at your beck and call?

467
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,500
An "actress" at my beck and call.

468
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,708
Stop moaning. Lead role, prime time.

469
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:44,625
Who offers work like this
with no lead time?

470
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:47,291
Can't I even research my character?

471
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,458
Welcome aboard.

472
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,458
Thank you so much.

473
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,791
-Tsurugi and Tsubame will descend.
-Yes, sir.

474
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:56,000
-Climb up, Sakuraba.
-Coming.

475
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:01,333
Let's snap a photo.

476
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,041
Say cheese.

477
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,083
Business couple after a hard day's work.

478
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,875
Long time, no see, Kana.
I thought you retired.

479
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,791
And you're on reality dating shows,

480
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,833
selling off pieces of your daily life.

481
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:41,625
Ms. Arima, the director's asking for you.

482
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,125
-Coming!
-Thank you.

483
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:44,416
Thank you.

484
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,375
You know her?

485
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,708
We've both been acting since childhood.

486
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,750
I detect some conflict between you.

487
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,333
It's all conflict.

488
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,416
Imagine being born

489
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,000
the same year as that "child prodigy."

490
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:19,625
She swiped every role I auditioned for.

491
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,208
But I'm not losing to her now.

492
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:29,666
As she sang inane songs
in a bell pepper hat,

493
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,041
I kept training hard.

494
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:39,500
Now's my chance to make good
on a longtime grudge.

495
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,625
Akane's acting style

496
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,458
is to fully "inhabit" a role.

497
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,375
Contrast that with Arima who "acclimates"
to the acting around her.

498
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:54,083
I won't lose to her. I can't.
It's impossible.

499
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:58,166
-Actors truly are a strange breed, indeed.
-I will never lose to her…

500
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:01,333
Most of them are so damn competitive.

501
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,958
I won't lose to her…

502
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:04,458
But as for me…

503
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:08,083
I just need to go
about my business quietly.

504
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,833
Can I toss that out for you, Mr. Himekawa?

505
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:14,916
Thanks.

506
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,250
Okay, cut.

507
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:36,041
Now pull the camera back.

508
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:38,916
Cut One will be a wide shot.

509
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,208
Clean that up a bit, will ya?

510
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,041
-Got it.
-Thanks.

511
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,291
Cut Two will be a pan shot.

512
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,916
"Toma finds a blade."

513
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,458
Cut Two is a pan of Toma
finding the blade.

514
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,833
-Like this?
-Yes.

515
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,666
-Alright, let's pull the camera back.
-Please do.

516
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,166
-Here we go from Cut One.
-Let's begin.

517
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,625
Places everybody.

518
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,583
All right.

519
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:06,000
This is the spot where
Toma's best friend dies

520
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,958
allegedly by curse of a sword.

521
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:15,791
Setting his eyes on the rotting blade…

522
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:21,500
Toma is rent with grief at the loss
of his dear friend.

523
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,916
Got it.

524
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,083
This is your moment in Episode 1.
Emote shamelessly.

525
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,916
Understood.

526
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,333
Let's do it.

527
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:33,666
-Just a second.
-One sec please.

528
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,625
-Here we go!
-We're rolling.

529
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,166
And action.

530
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:03,708
Just because of this, why did you…

531
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:09,291
-Cut.
-Cut.

532
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:11,333
Sorry, set that up again, please.

533
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,500
Once more please.

534
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,333
Don't think about it.

535
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,625
We need to see your feelings.

536
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,625
-Okay.
-Once again.

537
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,416
Once again please.

538
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,083
Let's do it again.

539
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,291
Just because of this, why did you…

540
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,541
Cut.

541
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,916
Just because of this…

542
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,875
Cut. No!

543
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,750
-Just because of this…
-Again!

544
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:40,583
-Just because of this…
-Cut! More emotion!

545
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,083
Take five.

546
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,875
Listen…

547
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,291
Here.

548
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:09,375
Thanks.

549
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,833
You've never done an emotional scene,
have you?

550
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,875
You keep a lid on your emotions.

551
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:27,333
So it won't come out in acting.

552
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,416
I've forgotten how long ago.

553
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:36,375
Unlike the Today Sweet director,

554
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:39,708
this guy won't let you play it dry.

555
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:42,458
He won't say it explicitly,

556
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,833
but this director wants genuine
emotion from everyone.

557
00:45:55,375 --> 00:46:00,708
Tell me how you pull off
a crying scene, Arima.

558
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:07,708
It depends. There's emotive crying
and physical crying.

559
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,583
This is common for child actors.

560
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,708
"Tell me Aqua…

561
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,958
what would you do if your mother died?"

562
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:26,875
For example.

563
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:31,291
The method of pretending a loved one
is before you.

564
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,666
Even you must have someone like that.

565
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:41,416
Just imagine losing that
important person forever.

566
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,916
Even you must have someone like that.

567
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,208
-Rolling!
-Rolling.

568
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:04,208
And action.

569
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,333
Just because of this…

570
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:21,791
you…

571
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,958
"Tell me Aqua…

572
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:28,083
what would you do if

573
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,625
your mother died?"

574
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:41,416
Don't forget it.

575
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,333
You weren't…

576
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,166
able to save Ai.

577
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,708
-Cut! Cut!
-Aqua!

578
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,375
-Cut!
-Cut! Cut!

579
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,416
-Can you hear me?
-Aqua!

580
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,333
-Aqua, you okay?
-Aqua, are you all right?

581
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,291
Get some help.

582
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,833
-Aqua!
-Hurry up!
