1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,041
AI HAS A VERY PROFESSIONAL SMILE.

2
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,333
BUT IT SEEMS TO LACK WARMTH.

3
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,250
That hurts a little.

4
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,750
I mean, my life's been built on lies.

5
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,541
Welcome!

6
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,833
PRIVATE PARTY TODAY

7
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,250
I loved the marshmallows.

8
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,666
That was obvious.

9
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,083
I could've eaten a hundred of them.

10
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:05,208
I expected three months to feel long,
but it sped by.

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,416
I'm so bummed it's ending.

12
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,000
-Let's all hang out again.
-Of course.

13
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,250
-Real soon.
-Real soon.

14
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,875
-Promise me.
-Yeah.

15
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:14,916
Well?

16
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,750
Are you two for real?

17
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,916
What?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,666
Will you continue the relationship?

19
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,208
I can't say for certain.

20
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,791
-Not tomorrow.
-Tomorrow.

21
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,083
-Can't do it.
-Tomorrow.

22
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,125
-Can't do it.
-Tomorrow.

23
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,958
-Is that early?
-Of course it is.

24
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,916
The last episode got the most
views in the series' history.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,458
Thanks to you.

26
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,250
Thanks to all the attention it got.

27
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,958
Don't be so modest.

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,791
Stop stalling and tell me about Ai.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,791
Patience, my friend.

30
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,958
You exceeded expectations.
You deserve to be rewarded for it.

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,875
How does going for sushi sound?

32
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,833
I'll tell you about her first love.

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,666
It better not be from childhood.

34
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:45,416
Don't worry.
I'll make it worth your while.

35
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:51,250
As far as I know,
it was her first and last.

36
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,750
Now I'm sure of it.

37
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,333
Kaburagi definitely knows something
about me and Ruby's real dad.

38
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,250
Hey, Aqua.

39
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,250
Can we talk… privately?

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,458
I wanted to get your thoughts on
what comes next?

41
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,875
How do you mean?

42
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,416
Well, the show ended with us as a couple.

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,875
Therefore…

44
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:31,958
Right…

45
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,458
We'd best keep that up a while.

46
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,458
Do you mean "professionally"?

47
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,208
Or would we be going out
with each other for real?

48
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,000
You can speak honestly.

49
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:57,625
I'm fully aware you don't see me
as a romantic target.

50
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,958
It's true.

51
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:09,875
I don't really see you in that way.

52
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:16,125
So our dating would only be
an extension of our work.

53
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,166
But…

54
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm extremely interested in you
as an actress.

55
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,208
I truly mean that.

56
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,000
I see.

57
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,000
I think I like that answer best of all.

58
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,166
Then let's be a business power couple.

59
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,791
One real couple from the show is enough.

60
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,500
Didn't you notice?

61
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:03,375
-Yuki and Nobu hooked up for real.
-Is that good?

62
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
Incredibly.

63
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,666
That sly fox.

64
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,625
She rejected him on the show.

65
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,125
B-KOMACHI

66
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,708
Say hi to the all new B-Komachi!

67
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,458
What's that?

68
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,000
It's our group name, silly.

69
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,458
You can't be serious.
That's a legendary unit name.

70
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,291
You said I could choose it.

71
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,583
I did, but B-Komachi
is out of the question.

72
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:46,750
What better way to revive
Ichigo Production

73
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,458
than with B-Komachi?

74
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,291
So now you're a top producer, too?

75
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,375
It's not a bad idea.

76
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,166
What!

77
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,833
It's instant traction.

78
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:02,833
With B-Komachi songs,
we can go right to live shows.

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,083
We already own all the rights.

80
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,083
And given that we can't spend money,

81
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,458
it's more practical than not.

82
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,666
Right?

83
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:21,833
But I have one more major proposal
to submit to you.

84
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,750
Till next time.

85
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,916
-See you.
-See you.

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,875
Don't be a stranger.

87
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
-Of course.
-For sure.

88
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,041
-See you.
-Bye!

89
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,125
This is going to be so depressing.

90
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,458
I'm going to miss this show so much.

91
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,208
Really?

92
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,583
I guess you've no reason to be sad.
You have Akane.

93
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,708
It's a professional relationship.

94
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:57,750
You say that, but you were smitten
by her rendition of Ai.

95
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,333
B-Komachi was before your time, right?

96
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:09,375
But to idol fans, they're legendary.
I've got all their DVDs.

97
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,333
Just between you and me,

98
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,666
I originally dreamed of becoming
an idol one day.

99
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:33,125
Of course, right now I'm perfectly
happy being a YouTuber.

100
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,458
-Listen Mem.
-Yeah?

101
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,416
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL GRAPHIC NOVEL
"OSHI NO KO"

102
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,958
BY AKA AKASAKA × MENGO YOKOYARI,
PUBLISHED BY SHUEISHA

103
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,791
Leave it to my twin bro. Same wavelength.

104
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,583
"A high school student
YouTuber and influencer."

105
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,000
She's hugely popular online.

106
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:46,750
But I never would've thought
you had idol dreams.

107
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:51,291
I need to confirm a few things first.

108
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:56,875
Are you currently signed with an agent?

109
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm contracted with the agency "FARM."

110
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,250
But as a partner, not under their control.

111
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,916
So you're free to choose
any work you like?

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,041
Correct.

113
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:14,916
That would include us hiring you
for idol-related activities.

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,291
Which means, contractually,
there shouldn't be a problem.

115
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,416
You're lying about your age, aren't you?

116
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,833
You can tell, huh?

117
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,333
So how old are you, really?

118
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,125
Major fudge.

119
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,000
Really? How old are you?

120
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,958
Like 21 or so?

121
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,541
That's a major fudge.

122
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,583
There's a legitimate reason.

123
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,666
Legitimate?

124
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:15,500
Ever since I was a child,
becoming an idol was my dream.

125
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,291
In high school, I started dance lessons.

126
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,583
And went to auditions.

127
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,833
But then…

128
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,833
in my junior year, my mother fell ill.

129
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,750
Single parent home, plus a little brother.

130
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,500
So I quit school and went to work.

131
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,208
By day, I worked in a bakery.

132
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,250
Welcome.

133
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:49,291
By night, I worked in a girl's bar
to get by.

134
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,458
Eventually, my mother recovered.

135
00:12:54,875 --> 00:13:00,208
But by then, I was 23 years old.

136
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,708
In the idol world, even turning
20 is considered "old."

137
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,625
I was ready to chase my dream again,

138
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,833
but I was no longer the right age for it.

139
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,708
Hold on a sec.

140
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,458
Somebody's crying.

141
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,666
Do you know how hard it was

142
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,541
for a child star to face growing older?

143
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:38,583
I think I can sympathize
with her just a little bit.

144
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,916
Just a little bit?

145
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,666
I started my channel while I worked

146
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,875
but said I was still in high school.

147
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:57,291
The more subscribers I got,
the harder it became to come clean.

148
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,333
Very interesting.

149
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,333
I guess it's a real stretch
to think I could

150
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,833
become an idol at 25.

151
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,333
Absolutely not.

152
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,125
There's no age ceiling for an idol.

153
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,666
Not if you still dare to dream.

154
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,583
Come, Mem-cho.

155
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,333
Won't you be idols with us?

156
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,458
Which is more believable?

157
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,958
To be a high schooler? Or an idol at 25?

158
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,791
What do you say?

159
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,000
Give it a shot?

160
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:51,416
Yes.

161
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,833
Welcome to B-Komachi!

162
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,958
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

163
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,250
Let's do this.

164
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,416
Yeah, let's.

165
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,541
See you later, Aqua.

166
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,000
Take care.

167
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,708
Arima.

168
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,916
Look after them…

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,250
Don't talk to me, okay?

170
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,208
Go "look after" that Akane,
you Casanova Meddler.

171
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,000
Casanova Meddler?

172
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:30,083
I'll look after them without you asking.

173
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,416
Goodbye, Letch Luthor.

174
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,625
"Letch" Luthor?

175
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,791
New B-Komachi bursts on the scene!

176
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,375
FUJIMI TELEVISION

177
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,083
Mr. Kaburagi.

178
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:26,708
I saw Love for Real. What an awesome show.

179
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,791
Thanks.

180
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:32,791
The online flaming was great.
Did you concoct that?

181
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,166
No way. That was a pain in the ass.

182
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,583
I can imagine.

183
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,791
Say, that's Tokyo Blade.
Are you producing that?

184
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,875
Yes, Mondays at nine.

185
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,916
Isn't the target audience a bit young
for the 9 p.m. slot?

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,625
The network wants a core fan audience.

187
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,583
You got the rights?

188
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:58,208
Yeah, but I had to do backflips for them.

189
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,916
The original work's huge sales
make the publisher prickly.

190
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,166
Starring?

191
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,333
Taiki Himekawa from Lala Lai.
Oh, and Akane Kurokawa, too.

192
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,500
Everyone's from Lala Lai?

193
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,166
As of this moment, yeah.

194
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,666
Lala Lai's Mr. Goa wrote the script.

195
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,541
And Mr. Kindaichi is directing.

196
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,916
I just need a few young hunks
to fill out the cast.

197
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,333
Tokyo Blade?

198
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:37,625
Yeah, I've done a few movies before,
but never a network series.

199
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,291
I could use your advice later.

200
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,208
I haven't any to give.

201
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,000
Sure you do.

202
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,333
I saw you on Today Will Be Sweet.

203
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,708
Your acting was amazing.

204
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:52,333
That's right. You and Arima
are the same age.

205
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,791
By the way, let me give you your ticket.

206
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,250
Here.

207
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,750
What's that?

208
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,166
For getting me a ticket.

209
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,625
Wow, thanks. I'm so happy.

210
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,250
And our photo together?

211
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, yeah.

212
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,333
Say cheese.

213
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,583
-I'll upload it later.
-Yes.

214
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,708
The rest of the dance is all on
a shared site.

215
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,208
Wow, you sure work fast, Ms. Saitoh.

216
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,708
I'll send the URL to the group chat.

217
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,708
-Please do.
-Okay.

218
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,041
Out of curiosity,

219
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,958
how many songs are left?

220
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,833
About thirty, I'd say.

221
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,666
You're not asking us to learn
all of them, are you?

222
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,041
Of course we are. We're the New B-Komachi!

223
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,375
Sounds like we'll be real busy.

224
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,375
Excuse me for a minute.

225
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:53,000
How the hell am I going to memorize
thirty songs?

226
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,208
I'm an actress after all.

227
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,583
I'll never match the motivation
of those two.

228
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,416
Oh, I didn't know you came.

229
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,083
I thought I told you not to talk to me.

230
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,875
Shouldn't you be with Akane?

231
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,041
It should go to the best dancer : me.

232
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,916
We need someone with
media experience. That's me.

233
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,208
What's all the fuss?

234
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,541
Who will take center position.

235
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,500
Does it matter?

236
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,666
-It totally matters!
-It totally matters!

237
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,916
It's every idol's goal.

238
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,583
She's the singing and dancing
face of the group!

239
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,791
I see. Decide among yourselves, then.

240
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,541
You don't want Center?

241
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,000
Absolutely not. Plus I'm an awful singer.

242
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,958
Leaving already?

243
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,791
I just remembered I have an errand to run.

244
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,208
Does Kana seem snarky lately?

245
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,666
She's a pain in the butt by nature.

246
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:43,208
Didn't she release a single once?

247
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,375
Search "Kana Arima" and "song."

248
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,458
"The Bell Pepper Exercise."
I remember that!

249
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,916
A huge hit. She calls it her dark past.

250
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,291
But look. Kana's in center position.

251
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:06,375
She doesn't want to do it, okay?
Now get ready to go.

252
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,041
Where are we going?

253
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:12,000
Karaoke, of course.
I need to hear you two sing.

254
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,541
Bring it on.

255
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,416
You're going down.

256
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,875
Without further ado,

257
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:31,416
B-Komachi's center position
is going to… Kana Arima!

258
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:40,541
How do you feel being named Center, Kana?

259
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,666
First reaction?

260
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,291
Turn off the damn camera.

261
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,958
I thought I told you,

262
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:54,375
"Absolutely not" on Center.

263
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,791
What? Did you think I'd just smile
and roll over

264
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:05,041
by putting me on camera
and pretending it's a done deal?

265
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,708
She saw right through that.

266
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,041
Senpai.

267
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,416
You've released songs before.

268
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,791
So what?

269
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:36,791
You do sound tone deaf on
"The Bell Pepper Exercise."

270
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,875
But you improved so much
on your second single.

271
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,333
And even more on your third.

272
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:49,125
I'm guessing you rehearsed a whole lot.

273
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,083
That's the kind of dedication

274
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:59,666
that would make you a reliable
B-Komachi Center.

275
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,208
You're not going to win me over
with flattery!

276
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,500
Center just isn't who I am.

277
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:15,541
And nothing's going to make me
change my mind.

278
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,625
Understood.

279
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:26,125
-Ms. Saitoh.
-I'm sorry for presuming.

280
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,500
But as a favor…

281
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:32,500
would you listen to these two sing?

282
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,708
No, really?

283
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,916
Why am I always such an easy pushover?

284
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:05,750
Not funny, tone deaf squawkers.

285
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,750
What a low bar to set for Center.

286
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,458
Stop grinning.

287
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:30,291
Let's face it. Compared to those two,
my singing's an improvement.

288
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:32,333
But…

289
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,916
I really don't want to be Center.

290
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:43,833
The face of the group shouldn't be
a jaded pain in the ass like me.

291
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:51,041
It's meant for pure and cute
girls like Mem-cho and Ruby.

292
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,666
Pure…

293
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,041
and cute.

294
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,458
Thank y…

295
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,208
I mean, no thanks. Leave me alone.

296
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,000
Arima.

297
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,375
I don't get your anger with me lately.

298
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,125
I know you're prickly and barb-tongued.

299
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,250
But it's…

300
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,375
starting to hurt a little.

301
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,625
Oh yeah?

302
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:44,583
You started it.

303
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,083
Thanks for coming on short notice.

304
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:24,208
No worries.

305
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,208
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

306
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,708
I'll meet anyone you want
if you'll tell me about Ai.

307
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,541
You're very persistent.

308
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:43,666
Why are you so obsessed with her anyway?

309
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,583
I'm a fan.

310
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,250
Do I need another reason?

311
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:58,083
A fan's fantasy crumbles easily
once exposed to reality.

312
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,500
You won't find a single exception here.

313
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:05,166
Still wish to go on?

314
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,541
Yes.

315
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,708
Ignorance is bliss. That's my view.

316
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,291
But fans can't settle for that.

317
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,041
I have to know.

318
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:28,083
I need to know what kind of life Ai led.

319
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,416
Why…

320
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,916
she had to be murdered.

321
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:50,166
I've long prepared myself for the truth.

322
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,875
The first time I met Ai

323
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,500
was when she had just arrived
in Tokyo from the countryside.

324
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,833
At the time, she wore
cheap clothes that didn't suit her.

325
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,208
Just a country bumpkin.

326
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:28,208
She had trouble fitting in
even after her debut.

327
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,208
It was her attitude.

328
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't think she felt the least bit
like an idol.

329
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,916
What did you say?

330
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,333
I wanna quit.

331
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:42,375
Quit? Who do you think you are?

332
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:48,708
She gave her boss fits because
he saw her talent before anyone.

333
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,250
Ai, wait!

334
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,958
LALA LAI THEATRICAL COMPANY

335
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,208
Hoping to change her attitude,

336
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,708
I recommended a drama workshop.

337
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,208
A workshop?

338
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,583
Lala Lai Theatrical Company,
where Akane Kurokawa is.

339
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:13,125
Now it's a popular theater group
and successful production company.

340
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:19,250
But at that time, it struggled to draw
even a full house of 200 people.

341
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:26,583
But soon after she joined, there was
a dramatic change in her.

342
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,166
If I had to guess, it was because
she found love.

343
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,750
Love changes people.

344
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:43,333
I remember how grown up
she suddenly looked.

345
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,625
Who was he?

346
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,916
What was his name?

347
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:55,625
I'm afraid even I don't know that.

348
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,416
About when in her career did that occur?

349
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:05,875
You know that she took
some time off, right?

350
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,375
She attended the workshop until then.

351
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:14,083
But I don't know the details.

352
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,125
Ai's time at the workshop

353
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:20,041
coincides with her pregnancy.

354
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,333
Oh, you're here.

355
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,291
Sorry I'm late.

356
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,625
Welcome.

357
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,541
This is Raida of Magic Flow.

358
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:39,083
He's a hotshot producer
of mainly TV serial dramas.

359
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,125
Sumiaki Raida. Charmed.

360
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,541
Hello.

361
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,708
-Beer?
-Yes, please.

362
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,166
-A beer please.
-Yes.

363
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,666
TOKYO BLADE

364
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,125
Just when I thought I'd found

365
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:17,041
everyone who worked with Ai,

366
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,916
the workshop was a blind spot.

367
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,125
It was never public.

368
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,375
The dramatization of Tokyo Blade

369
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:36,416
was to be run almost solely
by Lala Lai staff.

370
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:42,041
If I could work my way in somehow,
I might find more clues.

371
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,833
The Japan Idol Fest?

372
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,416
What's that?

373
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:52,291
The nation's biggest idol festival.

374
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,166
I got a call from a producer I know.

375
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:59,791
He's asking if we want to
take part in it next month.

376
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,541
No way.

377
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:05,833
Who'd book newbies like us?
Is that producer for real?

378
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,875
A group dropped out after a sex scandal.

379
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,541
We're pinch hitters.

380
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,791
Let's do it. This is our big chance!

381
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:18,791
I haven't learned the steps
to a single song.

382
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,666
I overheard everything.

383
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,958
Ms. Saitoh.

384
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:26,375
I'm president of this talent agency.

385
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:31,583
I don't like people calling my acts
directly, but work is work.

386
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:33,750
Let's do it.

387
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:37,125
But we've only a month to prepare.

388
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,791
We're just a side act. A month is plenty.

389
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:42,625
Yeah, so let's do it.

390
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:45,166
Good, now let's go gather intel.

391
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,125
I like your gumption. Go to it.

392
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,333
Aye-aye.

393
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:50,541
Where to?

394
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,833
I don't know.

395
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,000
How'd you score tix to Nogizaka46?

396
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:02,166
I just called a producer acquaintance
and prayed.

397
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,375
Wow, you are so connected.
I'm getting nervous.

398
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,625
Why? You're not performing.

399
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:12,916
We need to learn from the best
if we're to be on stage.

400
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,541
I honestly don't know where to begin.

401
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:22,625
We need to figure out what kind
of group we want B-Komachi to be.

402
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,166
Oh my God, I'm so nervous!

403
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,541
Again, you're not performing.

404
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:31,250
I can't wait! I can't wait!

405
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,583
Again…

406
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:46,666
My first live concert in a while
blew my socks off.

407
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,708
That's why they're the best.

408
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:59,625
What's wrong, Ruby? Tummy ache?

409
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,000
No, it's just frustration.

410
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,083
With what?

411
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,500
Being in the audience.

412
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,416
I wished I could be on stage.

413
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:28,750
One day, I promise,
we'll stand on that stage.

414
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,333
Right? Come on.

415
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:35,333
And away we go!

416
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,791
You're lagging, Senpai.

417
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,541
Okay, okay.

418
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:43,708
Ready and…

419
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,791
5,6,7,8…1,2,3,4…

420
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,750
5,6,7,8…1,2,3,4…

421
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:56,875
You can stink at song and dance
if you have a cute face.

422
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,791
That's what I used to think an idol was.

423
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:04,458
But…

424
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:09,125
seeing the best do their thing
made me realize,

425
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:14,083
I have no business on a stage like that

426
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,583
in the role of center position.

427
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:29,083
At least take it.

428
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:40,958
Are you beginning to regret
becoming an idol?

429
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,541
It's not about regret.

430
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,125
I made this decision.

431
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,541
I'm just…

432
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,708
not cut out for this.

433
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,041
Much less as Center.
It's not a position I belong in.

434
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, I think you're amazing.

435
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,500
You think you can flatter me?

436
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:20,166
Truth is, you don't know anything
about me.

437
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,875
Your mouth is your complex.

438
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:30,333
You prefer praise for your work
over praise for yourself.

439
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:36,333
You spare no effort trying to
live up to others' expectations.

440
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,541
No one feels more responsible.

441
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:49,791
I'll see you at the Japan Idol Fest.

442
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,541
I can't wait.

443
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,916
Fine.

444
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,583
I'll show you.

445
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,750
Which do we choose?

446
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,875
-Let's see.
-I don't know.

447
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,375
-Gloves are slippery.
-You're right.

448
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,666
Ready and choose!

449
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,083
Red for me like Ai.

450
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,333
It suits you. Both of you.

451
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:40,833
And you, Kana?

452
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,208
White, I think.

453
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,750
Coming.

454
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,125
What're you doing at this hour?

455
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,958
Looking for a little advice.

456
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,458
Sorry, the place is a mess.

457
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,708
Don't worry. I'm used to that.

458
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,166
I suppose you are.

459
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,958
When you worked on Today Sweet
it was ten times worse.

460
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,708
TODAY SWEET

461
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:44,208
Sorry to disturb you when you're busy.

462
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:48,083
Are you kidding? I'm doing a monthly.

463
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:52,083
It pales in comparison
to your weekly manga.

464
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,250
Not at all.

465
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,750
Your Tokyo Blade is incredible, Sensei.

466
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,291
The manga and anime are such hits.

467
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,041
Just wait till the live action drops.

468
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:07,333
Actually, I'm here about that drama.

469
00:41:13,625 --> 00:41:16,916
Would you come to the read through
this weekend?

470
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,041
What?

471
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,750
TOKYO BLADE

472
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:30,416
I'm surprised they cast you, Aqua.

473
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,875
They think reuniting us
will generate buzz.

474
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:38,083
The Love for Real couple.

475
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,500
It's not just because of that.

476
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,375
Oh, Mr. Himekawa.

477
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:51,541
Mr. Himekawa is playing the leading man.

478
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:53,958
Lala Lai's ace in the hole.

479
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,666
I'm Aqua Hoshino. Pleased to meet you.

480
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,125
Hey.

481
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:15,625
SCREENWRITER
GOA

482
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:20,541
Tokyo Blade is set in a world
where Japan has been destroyed.

483
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,000
DIRECTOR
TOSHIRO KINDAICHI

484
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:26,250
Heroes are dying one after another
from an evil curse,

485
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,083
killed in pursuit of an enigmatic sword.

486
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,708
BETRAYAL, FRIENDSHIP, MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

487
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:36,500
But behind what appears
to be an ancient curse

488
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:42,125
are serial murders orchestrated
by a shadowy figure.

489
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,958
In short, it's a whodunit mystery.

490
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,583
Are you all ready to start
the read through?

491
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,833
Yes.

492
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,125
"This is the sword of the hidden guild."

493
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,666
"Yes, when someone is cursed to death,

494
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,750
the blade starts to rot."

495
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,291
"It signals a human death."

496
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,750
"Kento eyes a sword displayed
on an altar."

497
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,250
"You can't believe in a cursed sword."

498
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,041
"Of course I don't."

499
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,916
"But the fact is three people are dead."

500
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,083
"I don't want to die."

501
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,625
"Kento picks up the sword."

502
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,291
TOKYO BLADE

503
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,375
"What're you doing?"

504
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,833
"This sword festival must not be held."

505
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,916
-"Kento draws the sword."
-"Don't!"

506
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:57,375
"It's time to end this
with our own hands!"

507
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:07,083
Cut.

508
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:12,666
Let's take a break, everybody.

509
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,416
We'll start Act Two in 45 minutes.
See you later.

510
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,625
-See you later.
-See you later.

511
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,000
ORIGINAL AUTHOR AND RELATED STAFF

512
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,791
What do you think, Abiko Sensei?

513
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,750
Everyone's acting is just so wonderful.

514
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,375
They're well trained at Lala Lai.

515
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,708
We wanted young actors with chops.

516
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,958
They're all so good, it makes me blush.

517
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:46,916
It doesn’t feel like something I wrote.

518
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,333
I'm glad to hear it.

519
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:53,041
It's all thanks to everyone's hard work.

520
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,416
I was wondering

521
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:01,875
if it's still possible to rewrite
parts of the script.

522
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,541
What?

523
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,250
Of course. We'll revise any part you wish.

524
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,875
-Where did you have in mind?
-All of it.

525
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:27,416
I'd like you to rewrite the entire script.

526
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,375
THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION

527
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,458
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
ARE FICTITIOUS
