1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:07,566
Oh,

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,033
-Show me the

4
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:12,966
ending. -Okay.

5
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:14,200
Let go of the last episode.

6
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,133
Mr. Leng returned the old mansion.

7
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,233
Miss Su's room

8
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,300
will be preserved forever.

9
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,066
Ouyang Yuchuan,

10
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:10,666
Bunny,

11
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:12,666
Mr. Ouyang.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,233
Yes.

13
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:22,700
Sir,

14
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,500
you can't drink anymore.

15
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,466
Uncle Wang.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,200
What can we do if it goes on like this?

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
Don't touch me!

18
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:34,966
I'm not drunk.

19
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:36,933
I can't drink it anymore,

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
sir. Sir, listen to me.

21
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,600
Get me another bottle.

22
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,133
Okay. Come on.

23
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:41,933
Get up.

24
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,133
Go to the sofa. Can you

25
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,066
get me a bottle of wine now?

26
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,066
Be good.

27
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,866
Get me another bottle of wine.

28
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:48,866
Listen to me, sir.

29
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,500
I'm not drunk. I can't drink any more.

30
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,366
Come on.

31
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,000
Give me a cushion.

32
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,633
Little rabbit,

33
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,266
I'm coming.

34
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,633
Hi,

35
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,033
What's your name?

36
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,900
Hi,

37
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:45,533
Bunny,

38
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,066
where are you?

39
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,433
I miss you.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,433
You fool.

41
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,566
Ms. Su, I'm moved.

42
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,333
I don't like the ending.

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Let's call it a day.

44
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:51,366
Dismissed.

45
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:33,600
Hi,

46
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:36,433
Little rabbit.

47
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,866
Let go of your incorrigible pride first.

48
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:46,933
Run to my warm arms.

49
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,033
Bunny,

50
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:09,366
aren't you happy to see me?

51
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Ouyang Yuchuan,

52
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,000
why are you crying?

53
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,200
Why are you here?

54
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,666
Of course I'm here for you.

55
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
Let me see if it's true.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,633
Little rabbit,

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,433
it really wasn't a dream.

58
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:02,200
Are you ready to accept my exclusive favor?

59
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:06,133
Yeah

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,066
The heart of Stallone is indeed the heart of true love.

61
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,866
But the main idea is not to separate two people,

62
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,700
but to test their love.
