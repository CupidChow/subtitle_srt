1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:11,066
Bunny,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,433
this is the dorm specially prepared by the business school

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,566
for teaching assistants with excellent working ability.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,633
Although the environment looks simple,

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,466
here,

7
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,700
But it represents the glorious history of Ouyang's family.

8
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:28,000
There have been so many years of ups and downs.

9
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,700
This is what you call

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,266
a comfortable office environment,

11
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:38,466
Bunny,

12
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,000
do you think I'm lying to you?

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,466
Or do you think the environment here is not good?

14
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:44,633
None of them.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,033
I just think,

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,300
if a teaching assistant lives in such a big house,

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,133
It's a bit gloomy here.

18
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,833
There's a clue to the Heart of Stallone hidden in this house,

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,533
and you're dead if you fool me.

20
00:00:59,266 --> 00:00:59,700
Please

21
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,000
Ouyang Yuchuan,

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,500
what are you doing?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,533
Moving out?

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,000
You want to live here too?

25
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,033
Oh sorry,

26
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:22,766
I forgot to tell you just now,

27
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:24,966
Interesting.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,566
Of course.

29
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,933
Fox.

30
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,600
Su Shengnan,

31
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,200
what do you mean?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,800
Didn't you say you don't like him?

33
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,866
Why are you with him?

34
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,433
I just moved two days ago,

35
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,933
and Miss Leng found out so soon.

36
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,166
Why do you care so much about me?

37
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,233
I'll give you one last chance.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,433
What's your relationship?

39
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,600
What's my relationship with him?

40
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,066
What does it have to do with you?

41
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,466
Why are you so shameless?

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,400
Sit down.

43
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,066
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk,

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
Come on, tell me about you,

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,066
the handsome Miss Leng,

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,700
A big star with millions of fans,

47
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,366
who is so beautiful,

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,466
Your pursuers went from Tokyo to Rome.

49
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,866
What do you like about Ouyang Yuchuan?

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,466
That's right.

51
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:52,966
What do I like about him?

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,233
You like him?

53
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,700
It's just a setup.

54
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:56,633
Let me tell you,

55
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,666
the plot was unreasonable from the very beginning.

56
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:04,400
No.

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,733
I just like him.

58
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:06,566
He's good everywhere.

59
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,866
If you don't like him, don't pester him.

60
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,566
Get off.

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Then I'll trouble you

62
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,266
to keep him away from me.

63
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm sick of it.

64
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:15,600
You.

65
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,200
I heard that you moved into our old house,

66
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,266
and disbanded the waiters and bodyguards.

67
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:29,700
Yes

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,566
Yuchuan,

69
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,666
you can't be so casual anymore.

70
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:40,166
How can you call strangers to live in an ancient mansion?

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,900
The current environment of the old mansion is not suitable for you to live in,

72
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:46,266
Yuchuan,

73
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,333
You can't be willful anymore.

74
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,400
You'd better come back.

75
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,166
Thank you, Grandma.

76
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,700
During this period, Miss Su taught me a lot,

77
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,500
that I'm not who I used to be.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,933
You and Leng Yan are engaged?

79
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,933
Why are you still not clear with her?

80
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,566
If such a thing gets out,

81
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,233
where will our Ouyang family put their face?

82
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:06,500
Yuchuan, you'd better leave that silly girl.

83
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,733
Are you worthy of Yanyan?

84
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,466
My marriage with Miss Leng,

85
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,466
was decided by you on your own when I was a child.

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,933
You all know that I don't like her at all.

87
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:17,700
It's even more impossible to marry her.

88
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,366
In Ouyang's family,

89
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:23,100
marriage is never up to you juniors.

90
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,633
Behind every marriage,

91
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,700
the Ouyang family's future is at stake.

92
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,300
Just like the marriage between your grandma and me,

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,900
the great Ouyang family has achieved even higher success.

94
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:39,766
Father,

95
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,366
I suddenly feel so pitiful.

96
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,733
Look at this kid.

97
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,700
You're used to it.

98
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:54,766
Nice.

99
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,533
Ouyang Yuchuan,

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,833
I knew it was you.

101
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:18,600
It's boring.

102
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,866
How do you know

103
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,133
I didn't teach you enough

104
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,066
last time?

105
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,700
Little Rabbit's lesson,

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,800
how can you forget it?

107
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:31,600
However,

108
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,333
you can recognize my hand.

109
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,700
Do you have me in your heart?

110
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,633
Look,

111
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,033
Surprise or not surprise.

112
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,066
I prepared it carefully for you.

113
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,333
Thank you.

114
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:53,600
Bunny,

115
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,433
thank you for your appreciation.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,133
I'll do better in the future.

117
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,133
Thank you so much.

118
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,366
Mr. Leng,

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,033
Ouyang Yuchuan, in order to pursue Miss Su,

120
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,633
You can't help but use all means?

121
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,066
Move into Ouyang's house

122
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,333
with Miss Su,

123
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:18,933
Is that true?

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,833
It's true.

125
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:22,833
He said

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,666
there was a clue to the Heart of Stallone in the old mansion.

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,700
I see.

128
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,033
I have to get the Heart of Stallone first,

129
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,966
I heard that Ouyang's family's secret is hidden inside,

130
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,033
So you didn't look for it for Miss Su.

131
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,033
Not exactly.

132
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,266
Mr. Leng is setting a banner,

133
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,100
in order to know the secret of Ouyang Family,

134
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,166
In order to get Miss Su,

135
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:56,966
must

136
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,833
If you want to buy the old mansion,
