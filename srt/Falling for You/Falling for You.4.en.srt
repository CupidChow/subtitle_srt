1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:08,366
Hello,

2
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:09,333
who is it?

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,233
Mr. Fang?

4
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:11,266
Yes, I am.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,200
I heard that you've been looking for the Heart of Stallone,

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,600
I have it here,

7
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,399
Please tell Mr. Ouyang,

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,366
what if you want the Heart of Stallone?

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,800
Just prepare the money.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,966
Why should I trust you?

11
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,233
It doesn't matter if you don't want it.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll send you an address.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,133
If you're interested,

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,833
Come to me at 3: 15 p. m. tomorrow.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,733
Go back first

16
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,133
and tell Ouyang Yuchuan the news.

17
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,566
Let's see how he reacts.

18
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,299
Help yourself.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,033
We work together

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,900
often. See you off.

21
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:07,233
I don't think this restaurant tastes good.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,666
I didn't expect my bunny

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,100
would like to eat in a restaurant like this,

24
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:13,866
Ouyang Yuchuan,

25
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,466
you're so funny.

26
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,466
Ouyang Yuchuan,

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,800
please stay away from me.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,533
I see you can't eat anymore.

29
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:29,766
Sir,

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,300
at 3: 15 p. m. tomorrow,

31
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,766
The Heart of Stallone will appear at 3:

32
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,566
15,

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,666
What if the Heart of Stallone appears?

35
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,066
Where are you? Give it to me.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,033
Bunny, don't worry,

37
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,899
let's enjoy this wonderful lunch time first.

38
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,766
Clear the venue,

39
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,566
everyone. Mr. Ouyang has booked the venue here.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,100
You can leave now.

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Ouyang Yuchuan,

42
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,299
not everything

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100
can be solved by spending money.

44
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,699
Did I make a mistake in spending money?

45
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,233
Sure, sure.

46
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:16,466
Mr. Ouyang,

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,566
if you like my shop,

48
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,866
I can transfer it at a high price.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,933
The landlady serves all the dishes in your shop.

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,933
Okay.

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,966
Where is Stallone's heart?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,700
Take it out now!

53
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:34,399
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

54
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,399
Look, I prepared them all for you.

55
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,366
What do you think?

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,733
Surprise?

57
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:47,799
Are you touched?

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,033
Are you still amazed that

59
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,799
there is such a heart-warming man in this world.

60
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:53,899
It's no surprise.

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,966
Not everything can be solved with money.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,466
I won't like you just because you're rich.

63
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,833
I know it's stressful to be with me,

64
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,499
so learn to get used to it.

65
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:02,233
Me

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,400
After all, you're with someone as glamorous as me.

67
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,766
You have to learn to accept the envy of others first.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,600
You're crazy.

69
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:12,466
Bunny,

70
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,233
where are you going?

71
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,166
What you said is disgusting.

72
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,799
I'm going out to vomit.

73
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,700
Sir, do you really want to buy the Heart of Stallone?

74
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:24,399
Yes.

75
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,233
Aren't you afraid that the other party is selling fake products?

76
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,766
For my little rabbit,

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm willing to do anything.

78
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,166
I'm going to get ready.

79
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,499
Uncle Wang,

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,166
please escort my bunny home later.

81
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,033
-Is that okay? -Okay, I got it. Let's go.

82
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:47,866
Sir,

83
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,466
the watermark of the certificate is correct.

84
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,666
There is no trace of composition in the photo.

85
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:54,399
Hi,

86
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,199
Here's the money you asked for.

87
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,599
Is it enough to buy the Heart of Stallone in your hand?

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
As the only son of Ouyang family,

89
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,133
I can't believe that only a little bit,

90
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,333
It's a bit too stingy.

91
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:12,999
I'll double it.

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,466
I'll pay twice.

93
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,799
What are you doing here?

94
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,333
Of course it's for Stallone's heart.

95
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,133
Hey, if it's not you,

96
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,299
I'll give you three times.

97
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,399
Have you seen enough?

98
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,699
Whether it's enough or not

99
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,166
depends on whether Mr. Ouyang is willing to increase the price?

100
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:48,466
Miss Su,

101
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:50,833
Manager Wang, why are you here?

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,333
Miss Su, stop my husband.

103
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,333
Or else, he'll get a fake Heart of Stallone

104
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,266
What?

105
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,466
That liar got it wrong.

106
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,766
The meaning of Stallone's heart,

107
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,466
the dragon of Stallone's heart,

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
It's not a dinosaur's dragon,

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,433
it's Linglong's Manager Long

110
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,799
How do you know this?

111
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,766
I'll tell you about it later.

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,033
What I want you to know now is,

113
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,266
for the sake of this Stallone heart,

114
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,166
He will do whatever it takes.

115
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,000
You might even bet on the Ouyang family's entire fortune.

116
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:24,633
Let's go now.

117
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,566
Your husband thinks money

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,066
can solve everything, right?

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Ridiculous.

120
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,266
I dare to use all my personal assets,

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,733
in exchange for the Heart of Stallone,
