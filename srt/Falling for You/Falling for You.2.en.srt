1
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:11,600
Ouyang?

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:12,766
Ouyang? What the hell is that?

3
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:14,266
Yuchuan

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh, right. Ouyang Yuchuan,

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,900
I'm telling you this for the last time.

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,766
My name is Su Shengnan instead of Su Li,

7
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,766
and if you really don't know

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,300
what the Heart of Stallone is?

9
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:25,833
Stay away from me.

10
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,233
Because I feel annoyed when I see you.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,866
Isn't it just to find a heart of Stallone?

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,933
What's so hard about that?

13
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,466
Watch your step.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,733
Let me tell you this,

15
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:35,833
as long as I want,

16
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,966
Even if it's the Eiffel Tower, I can fix it for you.

17
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:39,933
If I don't know, I don't know

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,533
where there's so much nonsense.

19
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,133
No one can refuse me.

20
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:45,300
Especially you.

21
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:46,600
Get in

22
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,533
Fine. I don't have a place to go anyway.

23
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,433
Manager Wang, right?

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,666
Is your husband always like this?

25
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,066
Isn't it boring to do nothing

26
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:03,900
and wander around all day?

27
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,000
I didn't want to start a career,

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,400
Miss Su,

29
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,833
My husband has never

30
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,566
felt so sorry for any girl.

31
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,000
Good morning.

32
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,066
My cute little rabbit,

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,933
that's the same line again.

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,533
I can't stand it.

35
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,333
Little rabbit. Little rabbit.

36
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,433
Yan'er, why are you here alone?

37
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:40,666
Where's Feng?

38
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,966
My brother has something to do. He'll be here soon.

39
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,733
Eat more.

40
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,533
Father, Grandma,

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,066
Yuchuan, have a seat.

42
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:53,666
Brother Ouyang,

43
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:55,833
Miss Leng,

44
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:57,633
Long time no see.

45
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,100
Please.

46
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,200
Hello, hello, hello.

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,266
Wait.

48
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,366
Who is this silly girl?

49
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:05,666
She's my colleague.

50
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,300
Grandma, I'm his colleague.

51
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,833
We're having a family dinner.

52
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,233
Why are you here as an outsider?

53
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,233
I don't think Miss Leng is our family either.

54
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,466
You can say whatever you want when you're short-mouthed.

55
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:27,733
I'm starving.

56
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:36,966
Why are you looking at me?

57
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,366
Such a silly girl without a tutor.

58
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,766
Yes, everything you said is right.

59
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,266
Gosh.

60
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,000
No, Hunian, you're not funny.

61
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,366
We're so far away,

62
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,333
but you're still blaming me for knocking it over.

63
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,166
Are you crazy?

64
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:03,866
Ouyang,

65
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,566
I didn't ask her to compensate me at all.

66
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:06,900
But look at her.

67
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,666
I'm going to get changed.

68
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,166
It's really hard to change my clothes.

69
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,400
I wonder if Miss Su is willing to help me.

70
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,766
All right. I'm almost done.

71
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:18,733
Let's go.

72
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:26,633
Su Shengnan, right?

73
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,366
Do you think Ouyang Yuchuan really likes you?

74
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,733
He just did it on a whim.

75
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,033
He and I grew up together,

76
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,433
and we are engaged.

77
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,833
He will definitely marry me.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,633
It's good.

79
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:41,633
A hundred years of good cooperation and early birth of your son.

80
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:42,366
You.

81
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:43,700
Me? What me?

82
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,366
Stay away from him.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,633
You don't even know how to say harsh words,

84
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,533
yet you're still acting like a vicious female match?

85
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,133
Don't worry,

86
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,566
I'm not interested

87
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,666
in your brother at all.

88
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,333
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

89
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,966
He's so good,

90
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,900
the girls who stay by his side all day,

91
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,066
How could I not like him?

92
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:07,800
Isn't that playing hard to get?

93
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm telling you,

94
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,333
I've seen too many people like you.

95
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,366
I have to deal with you today.

96
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,100
What are you doing?

97
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:17,400
I'll tell you for the last time.

98
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,866
I'm not interested in your brother Yuchuan at all.

99
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,500
If you're passionate about female competition,

100
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,900
I won't stop you.

101
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,933
But please don't implicate me.

102
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,633
I won't be there for you.

103
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,100
Have you heard of the Heart of Stallone?

104
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:38,833
What?

105
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:40,733
What?

106
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,166
It's okay. You're so pitiful.

107
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:49,966
Su Shengnan, I will take revenge.

108
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,166
That's Su Shengnan.

109
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:04,966
Yes, sir.

110
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,400
That's Ouyang Yuchuan's girlfriend.

111
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,766
The woman Ouyang Yuchuan likes

112
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:11,866
is indeed extraordinary.

113
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,966
Bunny, wait.

114
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,266
How can I go back?

115
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,133
What on earth

116
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,433
is the Heart of Stallone?

117
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,066
Our teaching assistant, Tutu,

118
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,233
don't you need to help the teacher revise his homework today?

119
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,366
You're really haunting me, aren't you?

120
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,100
I heard that Tutu, our teaching assistant,

121
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,566
accidentally revealed the exam questions in the dorm,

122
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,966
I was forbidden to live in the dorm by the teacher.

123
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:08,200
But it doesn't matter,

124
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,900
as long as our bunny is willing to beg me

125
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,000
to find us a place to live.

126
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,233
It's not that difficult.

127
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:14,966
Come on.

128
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,166
Let go of your hopeless pride first,

129
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,166
and run to my warm embrace.

130
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:21,766
Get out of the car.

131
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,033
Why?

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,833
Come down.

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,433
Don't you want me to run into your warm arms?

134
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:30,400
That's right.

135
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:38,533
Come on.

136
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,333
Don't be shy.

137
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,866
After all, for an excellent person like me,

138
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,233
it's human nature to want to get close to her.

139
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,633
I can't stand this line.

140
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,333
I told you to pretend.

141
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,633
You narcissist.

142
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,900
I'll kick you to death.

143
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,933
You call me bunny and pretend to be here.

144
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,733
Ouyang Yuchuan, I'm telling you,

145
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,533
I'll beat you every time I see you,

146
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,366
I'll beat you until you lose your son and grandson.

147
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:06,200
We can't fight anymore, Miss Su.

148
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:09,400
Mr. Su,

149
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:11,400
Sir,

150
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:13,966
Stop! Stop!

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,300
It hurts.

152
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:15,900
Be gentle.

153
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:31,966
What are you doing?
