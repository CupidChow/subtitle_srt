1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,200
Uncle Ouyang,

3
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:12,266
I paid several times higher than the market price,

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,600
I bought an ancient house symbolizing the glory of Ouyang family,

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,333
and used it as Leng Yan and Ouyang's wedding room

6
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,700
as a dowry before sending it back to uncle's house.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,300
I'm sure uncle and grandmother can see

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,166
how sincere our Leng family is to this marriage.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,133
Yes,

10
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:34,600
but recently I've been hearing that

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,133
Ouyang and a girl named Su Shengnan,

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,766
Looking for the Heart of Stallone,

13
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,800
do you know what it is?

14
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,700
As far as I know, it seems to have something to do with Uncle Ouyang.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,500
Nephew, what are you talking about?

16
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:51,200
Our families are family friends.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,933
I've never heard of the Dragon Heart that my nephew said.

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,833
But with Yuchuan's ridiculous behavior,

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,166
he must be the one who gets hurt in the end.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
My nephew, don't worry about Leng Yan and Yuchuan's marriage,

21
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,366
your father and I have already decided it.

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,833
It must be a perfect relationship,

23
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,466
Feng'er.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,533
Don't worry.

25
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,433
Isn't it just Su Shengnan?

26
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,766
Just give her to Grandmother.

27
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,233
Thank you, Grandmother. Thank you, Uncle.

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Go back first.

29
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,300
school board

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,333
Although my job

31
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:42,800
is excellent,

32
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,900
But you don't have to pay so much.

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,366
I have to trouble you to deliver it yourself.

34
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,066
Leave my grandson.

35
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,066
I'll give you all the money.

36
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:52,900
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,533
Ouyang Yuchuan and I

38
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,133
are just colleagues.

39
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,900
That's good.

40
00:01:57,466 --> 00:01:58,333
With this money,

41
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,733
you can go as far as you want.

42
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,133
Bunny,

43
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,233
you can't leave.

44
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,433
Mr. Ouyang,

45
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,533
the school board gave me so much money,

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,733
I can't refuse.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,433
I have to go.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
Ouyang Yuchuan's money was also given by us,

49
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,033
and we can take it back at any time.

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,633
What you said makes sense.

51
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,866
I'd like to thank the school board for giving me a chance to get rich.

52
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:29,733
Grandma,

53
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,200
do you have to break us up?

54
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,600
I can't live without Miss Su,

55
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,866
she doesn't like me because of money,

56
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,933
I don't know what happened between us.

57
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,800
But I'm sure she can't live without me.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,300
Miss Su,

59
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:51,733
is that so?

60
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,300
Of course not.

61
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:58,733
Me,

62
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:01,866
Ouyang Yuchuan,

63
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,800
you were wrong about me before.

64
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,300
School manager,

65
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,066
look at the money behind this,

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,100
Don't worry,

67
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,500
I won't lose you a penny.

68
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,400
Thank you.

69
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,833
Yuchuan, did you see it clearly?

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,533
Why does she want to be with you?

71
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:47,933
Grandma,

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,500
you insisted on her leaving,

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,066
Then I'll leave, too

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,800
You.

75
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,266
Ouyang Yuchuan,

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
isn't your face almost healed?

77
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,466
Let's go together.

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,766
Brother, don't laugh at Ouyang.

79
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,066
You're not married yet.

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,333
Turn your elbow out,

81
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,500
dance, dance, dance,

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,633
Shengnan,

83
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,100
Shengnan, come here.

84
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:23,633
You're back.

85
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:24,900
Come on, let's play together.

86
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,066
Come on,

87
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:28,400
Brother Feng,

88
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,366
Miss Su,

89
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,833
May I have a dance with you?

90
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:32,766
No, right?

91
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,500
What about Ouyang Yuchuan?

92
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,400
Upstairs.

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,866
Leave him alone.

94
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,133
Let's celebrate together.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,133
Celebrate what?

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:43,833
Bag,

97
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,466
I got only ten bags

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,500
in the country.

99
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,166
Bao Bao,

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,833
congratulations,

101
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,433
Shengnan,

102
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,733
are you still mad at me?

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,700
I'll feel very guilty if you do this.

104
00:04:59,233 --> 00:04:59,833
No.

105
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:00,800
Come on.

106
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:02,666
Let's play together. Come on,

107
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:03,866
let's play together.

108
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,100
Ouyang Yuchuan,

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,266
you were wrong about me before.
