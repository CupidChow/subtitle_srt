1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,666
Ouyang Yuchuan,

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,633
how can you compete with me?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,400
Only you deserve my exclusive love.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,066
Darn your exclusive pet bunny.

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,533
No matter what you say,

7
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,633
It's just a little trick in my eyes.

8
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,266
Do you have to break us up?

9
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:08,866
I can't live without Miss Su,

10
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:12,233
she doesn't like me because of money,

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,466
I don't know what happened between us.

12
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:18,366
But I'm sure she can't live without me.

13
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:45,800
Manager Wang,

14
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,033
why are you here?

15
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,800
Did you see Ouyang?

16
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,833
He said he was in a bad mood,

17
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,766
so he bought a flight ticket to Switzerland early in the morning.

18
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:00,066
Did he say when he would come back?

19
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
He said

20
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,833
he wanted to leave this place.

21
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,400
Miss Su,

22
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,033
Mr. Su left alone.

23
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
He wouldn't let me follow him.

24
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:19,100
You should also know about Stallone's heart.

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Old Master suffered

26
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:23,833
the same pain back then.

27
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,066
Actually, your choice is the best.

28
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,233
At the very least,

29
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,666
nothing happened.

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
I got it, Manager Wang.

31
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll make it clear to him when he comes back.

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,166
I won't let him suffer.

33
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,233
Don't worry.

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Shengnan,

35
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,533
bad news.

36
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Ouyang's dog got stuck in the branch.

37
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,366
Help me!

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,233
It's coming out.

39
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,733
He's out.

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,866
Shengnan, thank you.

41
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:03,900
Let's go back to the room.

42
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,533
Let's go.

43
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,033
Shengnan,

44
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,100
thank you so much just now.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,333
Come with me to save the dog.

46
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:12,466
I'm fine.

47
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,833
This is Ouyang Yuchuan's dog,

48
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:14,933
so I have to take care of him.

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,033
Later,

50
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:19,000
when he lands, we'll call him together.

51
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay,

52
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,300
I have a message for you,

53
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,066
At 8: 00 this morning, TH9966 flight from this city to

54
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:27,633
Geneva suddenly lost control and skated off the runway about one

55
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:31,233
minute after taking off and taxiing at Dongshe

56
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,166
Airport.

57
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,600
Some passengers in the cabin were injured.

58
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,733
Some flights at the airport are delayed.

59
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,366
The cause of the accident is under further investigation.

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,600
Shengnan,

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,966
what's wrong with you?

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Are you okay?

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,333
Miss Su.

64
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,966
-Fang Ye, drive faster. -Okay, Miss

65
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,366
Su.

66
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:26,666
What's wrong?

67
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,033
The road ahead seems to be closed.

68
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,200
What?

69
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,666
Miss Su. Miss Su.

70
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,233
Ouyang Yuchuan

71
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,066
hugged me too tightly.

72
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:34,766
I can hardly breathe.

73
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,333
I thought I would never see you again.

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
I was already at the airport.

75
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,166
When I got my boarding pass, I found out that

76
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,166
I didn't know where I had put my ID.

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,166
How dare you say that?

78
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:48,800
As long as you're fine.

79
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
I told you to run around.

80
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,000
I used to think,

81
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,633
your love for me was all set.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,700
So I can't accept it.

83
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:05,766
But later,

84
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,633
I found out,

85
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,633
Actually, a set love

86
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,200
counts as love, doesn't it?

87
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,766
My love for Bunny

88
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:16,866
will never change.

89
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,133
Like sunrise and sunset.

90
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,733
The tide rises

91
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:22,600
and falls. Roar!

92
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,033
By the way,

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
I've already returned your grandma's money.

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Little Rabbit, it's good that you didn't mention it,

95
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,633
but I get angry when you mention it.

96
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,600
Why did you take my grandma's money back then?

97
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:37,800
I can't believe you're still mad at me.

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Of course I'm angry.

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,100
However,

100
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:43,066
I won't be angry if you can correct your mistakes.

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
I can't punish you less.

102
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:48,966
What punishment?

103
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,400
What's your name?

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,166
White rabbit,

105
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:07,266
roar!

106
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,000
What's your name?

107
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Ouyang Chuan Chuan,

108
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,400
Ouyang Chuan Chuan,

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,333
Yes,
