1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,900
Sir, Miss Su's father is here to see you with fruit.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,000
Please come in.

4
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,066
Mr. Leng,

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,533
Uncle,

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,533
No respect, no respect.

7
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,100
You're welcome.

8
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:29,900
Have a seat.

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,566
Mr. Leng,

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,166
since we last met,

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,033
I've been thinking about it,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,700
so I came to recognize you.

13
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,200
Uncle,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
looking at your sad face,

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,200
Did something happen to you?

16
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:55,866
Look.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,366
What is it?

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,266
I can't hide it from Mr. Leng.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,433
I'm really sorry.

20
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,233
Uncle is really in trouble.

21
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:06,966
That's why I came to you.

22
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:09,866
Uncle, if you need anything, just tell me.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,066
I will help you.

24
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,233
Uncle knows,

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,733
the money you gave me last time,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For Su Li's sake,

27
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:19,633
what about me?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,233
But,

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,633
Uncle,

30
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:24,966
I'm sorry, Su Li.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,533
I want to pay back all my gambling debts.

32
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,266
With the money you gave me?

33
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,633
Gambling again.

34
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,833
I just want to

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,100
put this money,

36
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,600
Get them all back.

37
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,300
But I didn't expect

38
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,100
to lose all of them.

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,133
Uncle, there's really nothing I can do.

40
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:48,800
That's why I came to you.

41
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,700
Uncle,

42
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,133
I know everything.

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,266
You don't have to say anything.

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,800
As long as it's something that can be solved with money,

45
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,033
it's not a problem.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,400
Take the money first.

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
Well

48
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,733
Uncle, yes.

49
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:25,466
May I ask you,

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
how are you going to repay me?

51
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,933
Mr. Leng,

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,700
tell me. I'll do it.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Anything will do.

54
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes.

55
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,100
I asked you to get something

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,933
from Miss Su for me.

57
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,366
I don't like forcing others.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,800
It's all up to you,

59
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,900
uncle.

60
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:54,300
No, I won't.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,533
What do you want me to take, Mr. Leng?

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,300
Look,

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,966
Look,

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,766
Uncle,

65
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,133
there's 1 million here.

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,233
500thousand, you take it to pay off your debts first.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
All you need to do is to bring the Heart of Stallone,

68
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,100
and agree to our marriage.

69
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,200
Not to mention the Heart of Stallone,

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
you just want the stars in the sky.

71
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,433
I'll pick it for you, too.

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,033
Don't worry,

73
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,166
about what you've told me,

74
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,366
Uncle, I will never refuse.

75
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,200
Yes, yes, yes.

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,800
Don't worry. It's my pleasure

77
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,500
to work with Mr. Leng.

78
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,233
Since you've admired my daughter

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,333
for a long time.

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,333
Then I'll decide for Su Li.

81
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,666
I'll marry Su Li to you.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll take the money first.

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Think of it as ordering money.

84
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:55,833
Uncle,

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,500
keep your word,

86
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:58,566
It's a deal.

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,700
It's a deal.

88
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:00,966
One family,

89
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:01,833
one family,

90
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,066
one family, come here,

91
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,133
Uncle's family.

92
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:05,866
Come on.

93
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:06,466
Have some tea.

94
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,633
Su Shengnan,

95
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
don't leave such low-grade shower gel

96
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,333
at home from now on.

97
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:17,000
Got it?

98
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,666
Miss Leng,

99
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,166
there are some things that can clean your body.

100
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,400
There's no distinction between high and low, Brother,

101
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,400
why are you here?

102
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,300
Brother Feng,

103
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,700
Shengnan,

104
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:30,200
Yes.

105
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,366
Look, I brought someone here

106
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,300
to see your daughter,

107
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,466
If Mr. Leng hadn't led me,

108
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,566
I wouldn't have found you.

109
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,266
You live such a good life.

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,500
As a father,

111
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm satisfied.

112
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,166
This guy,

113
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,966
why are you two together?

114
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Shengnan,

115
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:56,766
don't be angry.

116
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:57,266
Listen to me.

117
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,433
It was uncle who found me.

118
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,633
Then he proposed

119
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,300
to me,
