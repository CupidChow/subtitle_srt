1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,666
I dare to use all my personal assets,

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,933
in exchange for the Heart of Stallone,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:12,666
Sir,

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,733
you'll ruin Ouyang Group.

6
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:15,500
Shut up.

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,266
Okay Ouyang Yuchuan,

8
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,533
you're ruthless.

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,033
The heart of Stallone is yours,

10
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,666
after staying in this smoky place for a long time,

11
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,466
It's not good for my skin.

12
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:27,866
Congratulations.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,100
Mr. Ouyang,

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,633
you gave me an offer that I can't refuse.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,133
Let's start now.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,766
I don't want to have a long night or dream too much.

17
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:40,900
Come on, come on. Mr. Ouyang,

18
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,100
please sign here.

19
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:50,366
Hold on.

20
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:52,266
Bunny,

21
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,566
where did you get the garlic seedlings?

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,300
Sir,

23
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,533
you don't like it, do you?

24
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,333
Come on, come on,

25
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,566
come on. Little garlic, believe it or not, I'll pick it for you.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,466
Stop!

27
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,533
If you dare to touch my woman,

28
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,566
you don't want to stay in this city anymore, do you?

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,400
Get lost!

30
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,133
Get lost!

31
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,066
The auspicious time has passed.

32
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,333
Cancel the deal.

33
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:52,566
Are you okay?

34
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm fine.

35
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:58,633
This is also the unique love that Bunny has for me.

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,500
You don't even know this stupid rock?

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,000
My husband doesn't eat human foods,

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
so it's normal that he doesn't know this stone.

39
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:10,966
For my little rabbit,

40
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,366
I'm willing to do anything.

41
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,733
Why don't you ask me why I want the Heart of Stallone?

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,933
As long as you like it,

43
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:20,466
anything will do.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,533
The Heart of Stallone helped me to leave this world.

45
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,066
Silly girl.

46
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:35,866
Manager Wang, right?

47
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,766
Do you know the secret of the legend of the Heart of Stallone?

48
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,900
Tell us about it.

49
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:50,533
Let's go.

50
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,000
Legend has it that hundreds of years ago,

51
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,466
the king of a country,

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,833
With the most valiant warrior in this country,

53
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,566
and falling in love with a girl,

54
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,866
Although the king can give this girl a rich life,

55
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,366
but,

56
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,466
In the end, the girl was moved by the true heart of the warrior.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,300
He chose to live with the warriors,

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,333
and the king was very angry when he found out,

59
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,666
He hunted down warriors and girls.

60
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,400
In order to protect the warriors,

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,700
the girl chose to

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,466
end her life.

63
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:36,666
Wait.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,300
This is indeed a tragic story.

65
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,100
But what does it have to do with the Heart of Stallone?

66
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:49,000
The heart of Stallone is also called the heart of true love.

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,733
Do you understand the heart of true love?

68
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,833
It doesn't matter at all.

69
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:56,800
Do you not believe in true love?

70
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,000
True love can overcome everything.

71
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:58,866
All right, Manager Wang,

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,933
I have work to do at work.

73
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:00,833
Take your time.

74
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:01,766
I'll go first. Bye,

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,533
Bunny. Wait.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

77
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,866
This is the story of the Heart of Stallone.

78
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,066
Did you hear anything from this story?

79
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,833
It's a tragic love story.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,700
That's not the point.

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,733
The important thing is.

82
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,700
Manager Wang

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,333
seems to know a lot.

84
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,266
Mr. Leng,

85
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,633
are you trying to drive Manager Wang away from Ouyang Yuchuan?

86
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,066
Let him join us.

87
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,433
In this way,

88
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
we can get the Heart of Stallone earlier.

89
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,533
That Su Shengnan,

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,500
what's so good about that?

91
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,533
What's so good about it?

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,300
You have to ask Ouyang Yuchuan about that.

93
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,200
As long as he has it,

94
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,800
I will have

95
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,533
a good Mr. Leng.

96
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:16,233
I'll do it now.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,933
We work together

98
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:32,833
often. See you off.
