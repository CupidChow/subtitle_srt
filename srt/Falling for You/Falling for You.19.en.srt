1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:06,433
By the way,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,400
I'm now,

4
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,633
I got promoted again.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,300
Now I'm the Teaching Assistant.

6
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,200
Congratulations.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,633
Shengnan is so outstanding,

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
I happen to have a job here,

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,000
It's tailor-made for you.

10
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:22,233
Do you want to think about it?

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,066
Stop messing around,

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:25,766
Feng. I can't do it.

13
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,466
By the way,

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,366
it's lunch time again.

15
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:32,266
How about

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,533
we go to the usual place and talk over dinner.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,033
This time, it's on me.

18
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,533
No problem. Let's go.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,233
Brother Feng,

20
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,666
what kind of position do you think it is?

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,766
Let me see if I can do it.

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Here's the thing Shengnan,

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,800
where's Leng Group?

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,400
Now I'm making a new beauty product,

25
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:01,266
Yes

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,133
I asked you to be my spokesperson,

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,333
Me,

28
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,500
I'll be your spokesperson.

29
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:09,266
No,

30
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,466
with my figure and appearance,

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,033
You let go of your superstar

32
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,233
instead of using me as your spokesperson,

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,233
Aren't you afraid that none of your products can be sold?

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,900
I think we should

35
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,166
put this matter on hold.

36
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:19,966
And then?

37
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:20,700
Let's eat now.

38
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,866
Go home after eating.

39
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,233
Don't reject me in a hurry.

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,100
Listen to me first.

41
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,333
This product is mainly for the elite in the workplace,

42
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,000
and you can stay in school after graduation with the first place.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,333
Yes.

44
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,033
Strong ability,

45
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,066
beautiful, kind and generous.

46
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,900
He's the perfect spokesperson for us.

47
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:38,666
And contemporary speakers have a lot of income.

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,100
How about this? Brother Feng,

49
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,233
I promise you first.

50
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,033
As for the money,

51
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:44,866
I don't want any more.

52
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,666
Why?

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,033
Because I told you before,

54
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,633
before I paid off your rent,

55
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,466
Everything you want me to do,

56
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:55,700
if I have the ability,

57
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,266
I'll do it for you.

58
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,633
Why are you laughing?

59
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:00,933
Okay,

60
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,266
In that case,

61
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:03,833
the endorsement fee,

62
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,900
Just take it as you pay me back first.

63
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,700
If this product sells well,

64
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,166
there will be an extra commission.

65
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,133
What do you think?

66
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,433
I think

67
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:14,866
that's a good idea.

68
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,200
Thank you first.

69
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,233
For what?

70
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,633
I'm really happy

71
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:20,300
to be able to do something for you.

72
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,266
After you finish this bowl,

73
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,133
I'll treat you to another one.

74
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,033
You're treating me like a pig.

75
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,433
How could it be?

76
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,566
Eat first.

77
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,000
Have a try.

78
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,266
Okay. Let's have a hand

79
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,733
first. -Yes. -Okay.

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,633
Relax. Relax.

81
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,366
OK

82
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,833
Let's change the position,

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,466
Okay,

84
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,500
Take a big step forward.

85
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:48,566
Then your shoulders sink.

86
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,033
-Look at me. -Yes.

87
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:50,933
Nice.

88
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,300
Okay, let's go to the next one.

89
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,266
Okay, look here. Yeah.

90
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,966
-Look here. -Okay.

91
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,166
Very pretty.

92
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,066
Okay,

93
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,366
Brother Feng, come here.

94
00:02:59,366 --> 00:02:59,833
Perfect.

95
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,666
Let's take two photos,

96
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay.

97
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,466
The food there is really delicious.

98
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,233
Ouyang,

99
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:32,833
I'm really sorry.

100
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,200
I apologize to you on behalf of my sister.

101
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,766
It's all my fault that I neglected to discipline that girl,

102
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,333
which caused you to be stung by wasps.

103
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,433
Ouyang,

104
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,100
you're back.

105
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,600
Brother,

106
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,200
Why are you here?

107
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,000
Shengnan and I

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,033
just went to our favorite restaurant.

109
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,366
I just sent her back.

110
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,066
By the way, visit Ouyang.

111
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,733
As for my disobedient sister,

112
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,933
I have a piece of good news for you,

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,666
Shengnan has decided to be the spokesperson

114
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,133
of our new product.

115
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Really?

116
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,066
Congratulations, brother.

117
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,966
I think with Shengnan's endorsement,

118
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,033
this product will be very popular.

119
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,966
That's another story.

120
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,700
I've never shot a poster like this before,

121
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,933
why don't you take a look at it for me?

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,666
Okay. Did you

123
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,366
take a good picture?

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Look how beautiful it is.

125
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:31,933
Ouyang,

126
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,566
look at

127
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,033
this photo. It's so beautiful.

128
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,000
Look.

129
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:43,300
Brother Ouyang.

130
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,533
Brother Ouyang.

131
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,800
Ouyang, remember that plaster.

132
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,733
Shengnan,

133
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:58,766
it's so unfair.

134
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,900
I didn't even take a picture with you.

135
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,966
You're too partial.

136
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,433
I'll take a group photo again when I have a chance.

137
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,233
Well, I'm thanking your brother

138
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,066
for finding me a job.

139
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,333
I won't delay you two from catching up.

140
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,233
I'll go back now.

141
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:09,900
Wait,

142
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,066
what's going on?

143
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,800
The situation is Su Shengnan and Stallone's heart,

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm determined to win it.

145
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:18,633
It's impossible.

146
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,066
A few days ago, they were so close.

147
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,900
Brother,

148
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,566
I think something good is about to happen to you.

149
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,566
Leave it to me.

150
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:31,500
Don't worry,
