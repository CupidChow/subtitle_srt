1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,666
Every time it comes to a critical moment, it turns off the engine.

3
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,466
There's something wrong with the soup.

4
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,266
Dog.

5
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,300
A puppy?

6
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,000
Come here.

7
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:05,733
A puppy?

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
That's great.

9
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,866
Why is it raining?

10
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,033
What if

11
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,300
it rains?

12
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,700
Little rabbit,

13
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:32,766
don't be afraid.

14
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:38,966
We have this.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,033
Are you ready?

16
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:42,533
Let's go.

17
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,800
Let's take shelter from the rain.

18
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,333
It's still raining,

19
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,266
Yes.

20
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,766
The water is rising.

21
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,666
Come up! Come up! Come up!

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,466
Not yet.

23
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,433
I can't drown it.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,466
My shoes.

25
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's

26
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:24,900
go boating.

27
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:25,566
Yes.

28
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:27,533
Let's go.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,033
Go, go, go, go!

30
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,466
Hurry up.

31
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm rowing.

32
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,800
What are you doing?

33
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,866
A giant panda.

34
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,100
Is there really a panda?

35
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:57,266
What should I do?

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,466
It's too dangerous! Let's run!

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,333
Let's go!

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,933
It's snowing.

39
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,066
It's so beautiful.

40
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:30,666
It's so cold.

41
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,466
Bunny, are you cold?

42
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:08,933
There are meteors,

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,066
Yes.

44
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:10,666
Make a wish!

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,133
Little rabbit,

46
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,866
what wish did you make?

47
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,166
How can you say your wish?

48
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,900
All my wishes are about you.

49
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:52,566
Little rabbit,

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,366
you'll catch a cold in such heavy snow.

51
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,166
Come closer to me.

52
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:04,766
Then come closer to me.

53
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,266
Su Shengnan,
