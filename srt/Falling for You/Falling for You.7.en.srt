1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,200
Mr. Leng,

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,366
it's not because of the money.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,633
To be a perfect manager,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,566
you can't do it without the boss's permission,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,433
Leaving without permission,

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,533
sir,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,800
Tell me,

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,233
how should I punish you this time?

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,100
Sir,

11
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:22,733
I'm old,

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,300
I didn't do a lot of things well enough.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,966
You should find someone more suitable to take care of you.

14
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,599
It's time for me

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
to retire and make way for young people.

16
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:38,533
That's not what you said before.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,433
You said

18
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,799
you would always be with me.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,366
Until you get old,

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
I'll take care of you.

21
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:50,933
You also said,

22
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,733
no matter how the people around me set me up,

23
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,299
You won't leave me.

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,400
He won't lie to me.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,166
how

26
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,133
Now you're going to lie to me, aren't you?

27
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,266
Sir, I was wrong.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
I shouldn't have left you.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,466
Let's go home.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,466
Let me do it, sir.

31
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,399
Let's go.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,633
Let's go home.

33
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,066
Bunny,

34
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,133
Today,

35
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,933
Uncle Wang is my exclusive favorite today,

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,366
so I'll just give you a hand.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,666
Let's go.

38
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,700
Let's go.

39
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,499
I didn't expect you to be so loyal.

40
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,866
Loyalty is also one of my many outstanding qualities.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,433
Ouch,

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,500
Ouyang Yuchuan,

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,233
To tell you the truth,

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,233
your behavior is very greasy,

45
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,999
Girls don't like it at all.

46
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,166
It's so annoying.

47
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,099
Bunny,

48
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,166
no matter what you think of me,

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,333
I won't give up pursuing you.

50
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,833
You have to be rigorous and rigorous.

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,933
Okay, Sis Su Su.

52
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,733
Okay, go ahead.

53
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,099
Miss Su,

54
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,199
I've reflected on what you just said,

55
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,399
So I prepared afternoon tea for you.

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,233
Remove grease.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
So that you can have

58
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,333
a moment of leisure after work,

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,933
How about this

60
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:01,066
So that you can finish the next heavy work with more energy.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes, I'll leave it here.

62
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:03,933
Thank you, Manager Wang.

63
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:08,699
Wait.

64
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,366
How could I fail

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,533
Mr. Ouyang's sincerity?

66
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,033
You don't have to be so moved.

67
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,166
Chen, get all the people

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,233
in the library here.

69
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,100
What?

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,866
Bunny,

71
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,199
do you want to announce the good news between us

72
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,266
in front of everyone?

73
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,799
Just leave it to me.

74
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,366
I'll tell everyone.

75
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,766
Su Shengnan is Ouyang Yuchuan's exclusive favorite.

76
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,166
In Ouyang Business School,

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,466
every teaching assistant works hard,

78
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
It's been hard for everyone.

79
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,133
Then you're welcome.

80
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,033
Let's enjoy this

81
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,466
wonderful afternoon tea time with Mr. Ouyang.

82
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:58,766
I see.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
What Miss Su said makes sense.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Everyone worked hard,

85
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,766
including our cleaning lady,

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,600
Without your efforts,

87
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,433
there would be no neat Ouyang Business School,
