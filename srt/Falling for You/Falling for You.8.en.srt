1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:08,966
Sir,

3
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,233
is there something wrong with the coffee?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,333
Nothing.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,966
Have I never said thank you to anyone?

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,566
Sir, you don't have to,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,833
Should I thank you all for your hard work?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I think what Miss Su said makes some sense,

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,366
but you don't have to be too harsh on yourself.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,900
Is that why Bunny doesn't want to get close to me?

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,866
Maybe she just doesn't like living in a spacious house.

12
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,666
Do you have a warm house in our house?

13
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:43,466
Yes.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,166
It seems that there's an old house

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,933
in Ouyang's house that's vacant.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,500
By the way, sir,

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,733
you can use improving the teaching assistant's working environment as an excuse,

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,600
Let Miss Su move in.

19
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,566
And we can look for clues

20
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,899
to the Heart of Stallone in the old mansion,

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,566
You can also use this to get close to Miss Su,

22
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,333
so like this,

23
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,066
That is to say,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
after finding the Heart of Stallone,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,300
The rabbit will take the initiative to throw itself into my arms.

26
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:13,766
Maybe it is.

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:17,766
Okay.

28
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,500
Hey,

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Miss Su,

30
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:43,433
have you finished your work?

31
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,733
I've prepared a lavish dinner feast for you.

32
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,166
We'll pick you up now.

33
00:01:47,966 --> 00:01:48,799
Ouyang Yuchuan,

34
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,233
I'm telling you, no one likes your dinner.

35
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,099
I'm going to eat something I like.

36
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:56,299
Besides, before you find the Heart of Stallone,

37
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,599
don't bother me.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,900
Sir,

39
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,333
it seems that Miss Su doesn't like lavish dinners.

40
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,833
Boss, it's the same.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,866
Okay.

42
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,399
Mr. Leng, why are you here?

43
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:30,366
Sit down

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,866
The restaurant I eat is just a small fly restaurant.

45
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,866
It's not suitable for a neat freak like you.

46
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,399
I'm not the kind of person who's obsessed with cleanliness when it comes to food.

47
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,366
All I know is,

48
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:43,899
I like it here.

49
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:45,233
Really?

50
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,499
I'm telling you,

51
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,433
I like this place the most, too.

52
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,899
I think the food here is the best.

53
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:51,166
Right?

54
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,033
I also think the food here is delicious.

55
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:55,966
Miss Su,

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,633
if you

57
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,133
have time,

58
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,333
We can come together more often.

59
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:02,466
Okay.

60
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,699
That would be great.

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,500
That's great.

62
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,166
Oh, by the way,

63
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,266
the rent,

64
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:10,599
Keep it

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
It's just right.

66
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,066
Okay. Where's the rent?

67
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,133
I'll keep it for now.

68
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,899
But let me make it clear,

69
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,199
for this meal,

70
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:31,899
I'll treat you.

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,366
Thank you, Mr. Leng, for paying the bill.

72
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:35,533
You're welcome.

73
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:36,633
Coming.

74
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,066
Come on.

75
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,800
-Enjoy. -Let me know if you need anything. -Okay. Thank

76
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,199
you, Madam.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,933
Thank you, boss. You're welcome. Wait,

78
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:43,799
wait, wait, wait,

79
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,633
Wipe it.

80
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Miss Su,

81
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:55,166
I heard that you're looking for something called the Heart of Stallone,

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,133
What is that?

83
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:58,866
Is it important?

84
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,133
I don't know what it is.

85
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,200
But it's important.

86
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,899
How important is it?

87
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,566
It's as important as life.

88
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:13,366
Hurry up and eat.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,466
Brother,

90
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,299
you're so unsympathetic.

91
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,533
Ouyang Yuchuan,

92
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:47,866
what are you doing here?

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,633
To take Miss Su back to her residence, of course.

94
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,166
Residence.

95
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,700
What place?

96
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,166
I heard that Miss Su has been promoted

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,833
to administrative assistant professor.

98
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:02,899
I even got a raise.

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,433
As the best teaching assistants of Ouyang University,

100
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,466
outstanding staff representatives should enjoy a better and better

101
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:09,866
living environment,

102
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:11,899
Me,

103
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,699
No need.

104
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,133
I have a clue.

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,833
It's about the Heart of Stallone,

106
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:18,899
Let's go.

107
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:21,266
Let's go.

108
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:36,866
Let's go.

109
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,800
Bunny,

110
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,533
this is the dorm specially prepared by the business school

111
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,799
for teaching assistants with excellent working ability.

112
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,666
Although the environment looks simple,

113
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,466
here,

114
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,866
But it represents the glorious history of Ouyang's family.

115
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,133
There have been so many years of ups and downs.
