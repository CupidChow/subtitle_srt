1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:06,400
Where's Heavenly Star?

3
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:07,866
Always chasing Haichuan Star,

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,866
when Heavenly Saint Star gets closer?

5
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,266
Haichuaxing will stay away from us.

6
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,266
But as long as Heavenly Saint Star approaches faster than Haichuan Star,

7
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,633
they will be together.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,566
Like,

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,866
you and me.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,933
I don't think so.

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,800
These two stars collided.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,833
That's a disaster.

13
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,266
Ouyang Yuchuan,

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:41,966
Yes.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Tell me about your mother.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,100
They love each other,

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,500
Because my grandpa didn't agree.

18
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,366
So we split up.

19
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,233
Don't you want to know the truth?

20
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,100
Come here.

21
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,066
Auntie probably doesn't want to leave your father.

22
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:00,800
Like me,

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,533
she will leave one day.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,266
If I disappear,

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,466
what will you do?

26
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,666
I don't know what's going on

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,300
between you and my biological mother?

28
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't think you'll leave me like her.

29
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,300
You always said that I was set up,

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,900
that I exist because of you.

31
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:37,766
Silly girl,

32
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,566
forget it.

33
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:40,600
Go back to sleep.

34
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,266
Aunt Ouyang should have gotten Stallone's heart,

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,466
so she had no choice but to go back to her own world,

36
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,266
I think I already know what Stallone's heart is.

37
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,966
Should I keep looking?

38
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:59,800
Only you deserve my exclusive love.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,500
Su Shengnan,

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,100
what are you thinking?

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,300
You and Ouyang Yuchuan are from two different worlds,

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,766
not to mention,

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,800
You're about to leave this world.

44
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,800
When it is broken, it will be broken,

45
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:48,800
leaving no future trouble.

46
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,266
I can't give Ouyang Yuchuan any more hope.

47
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:02,700
Knock,

48
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,800
knock, bunny,

49
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:05,966
Good morning.

50
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,333
Get up. If you don't get up,

51
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,366
I'm coming in.

52
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,700
I'm coming in.

53
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:17,900
Bunny,

54
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,700
didn't we agree to go to work together?

55
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:26,900
Bunny,

56
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,466
you left in a hurry this morning,

57
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:29,500
I didn't eat breakfast.

58
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,400
This is a bento I made

59
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,266
especially for you.

60
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:34,533
No, thanks.

61
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,600
I made it myself.

62
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,400
I've been studying for a long time.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,400
Have a taste.

64
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:45,766
Ouyang Yuchuan,

65
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,566
I have other things to do.

66
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,466
It's delicious.

67
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,100
Brother Feng,

68
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:28,466
why are you here?

69
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:31,100
Whenever I'm in a bad mood,

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,033
I come here

71
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,766
to see the sea,

72
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,000
And then shout a few times,

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,300
why is Shengnan in a bad mood?

74
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:42,266
Yes.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,400
You're right.

76
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,566
Sometimes,

77
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,100
I think we are quite alike.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,700
By the way,

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I can take this opportunity,

80
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:54,766
I apologize to you on behalf of my sister.

81
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,366
It's all in the past.

82
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,133
No need to apologize.

83
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,866
Leng Yan's current personality and temper,

84
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,100
in fact, are all my fault.

85
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,266
When we were little,

86
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,066
our parents passed away.

87
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,766
As the eldest brother of the family,

88
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,100
I have to take care of her.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,200
It was because of my love,

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,633
that she became unreasonable.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,100
You almost got stung by wasps.

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,866
And Ouyang Yuchuan's face

93
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:20,466
got swollen.

94
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,500
Mr. Ouyang,

95
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,766
he doesn't know if I'm in the room,

96
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,066
So he rushed inside with his life.

97
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,466
Do you think he's stupid?

98
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,200
Isn't he worried about you?

99
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,200
I don't need him to worry.

100
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,300
I have nothing to do with him.

101
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,200
I just want to

102
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,100
get a part-time job in this business school,

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,000
That's why I got close to him.

104
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,433
Sir,

105
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,600
what Miss Su said may not be what she meant.

106
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,633
Uncle Wang,

107
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:51,733
you don't have to say any more.

108
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,100
Maybe I'm the image Miss Su said,

109
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,766
so let's go back.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,933
Go back and pack up.

111
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,066
Moving out of the old house,

112
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,300
I was thinking,

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Maybe my father

114
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:09,166
was right.

115
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,666
Sir,

116
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,833
there must be a misunderstanding.
