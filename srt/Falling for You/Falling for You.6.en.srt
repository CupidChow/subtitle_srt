1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:35,700
Your Ladyship.

3
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,533
Manager Wang,

4
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,366
maybe you're getting old too,

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,233
Why have you been making mistakes lately?

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,533
Thank you for your dedication to Ouyang Family over the past 40 years.

7
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,133
It's time

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,300
to retire.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
I see, Your Ladyship.

10
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,400
Sir,

11
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,633
I might have to leave Ouyang's house.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,533
But the secret of Stallone's heart,

13
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,266
I will protect it.

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,700
Leng Feng,

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,566
Ouyang Yuchuan,

16
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,466
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm here to pick up Miss Su, of course.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,433
Do you have the ability?

19
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,166
What kind of strength is that?

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,033
I'm just not prepared.

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,166
You came to see my face?

22
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:46,666
What is it?

23
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:47,533
Look carefully.

24
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:48,833
I don't see anything.

25
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,766
Yeah, nothing.

26
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,400
I can't even see my pores.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,633
Immaculate,

28
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,233
not like you.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
It's shiny and dirty.

30
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:58,133
Shut up!

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,666
I wash my face with a constant temperature of 35 degrees every day,

32
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:01,566
how can it be dirty?

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,300
It's not like you whining like a sissy.

34
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:04,366
You don't even have a hair.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,966
You're all here.

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,200
Bunny Miss Su,

37
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,833
Brother Feng Ouyang Yuchuan,

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,066
Let me talk to you.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,566
Don't be annoying.

40
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,133
Just wait and see.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,133
I don't deserve you to do this for me.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,533
For my little rabbit,

43
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:27,633
I'm willing to do anything.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,100
No, you still have a lot of time and energy.

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,900
To do a lot of meaningful things.

46
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:33,966
You should know,

47
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,666
the fact that you like me is just a setup.

48
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,133
Let's put aside the settings.

49
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,033
I don't like people like you at all.

50
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:41,800
Just give up.

51
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:42,633
Really?

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,833
Bunny,

53
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,233
this is the hundredth time you've rejected me.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,633
But it doesn't matter. I'll wait

55
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,033
until the day when this number ends.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,200
After all, only a good man like me

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,833
can do such a thing.

58
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,333
I just don't get it.

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,966
You are a narcissist who lives in your own world every day.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,733
Bunny, no matter what you say,

61
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,133
it's just a little trick in my eyes.

62
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,933
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Bunny,

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,900
are you ready?

65
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm going to start my 501st pursuit.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,900
Little rabbit, I'm coming.

67
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,100
Manager Wang is leaving like this,

68
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,033
you'd better inform Mr. Wang first.

69
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,833
For the last time,

70
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:00,833
the person you like is Su Li.

71
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,766
My name is Su Shengnan,

72
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,466
do you understand this time?

73
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,933
Su Li is my exclusive favorite,

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,600
Su Shengnan is also my exclusive favorite.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,800
So Su Li and Su Shengnan

76
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,300
are the same person,

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Excuse me,

78
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,233
pick up the phone,

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,400
Hi, Uncle Wang.

80
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,100
What's wrong?

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,100
Okay,

82
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,433
Okay, I'll be right there.

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,733
Are you okay?

84
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm not okay at all.

85
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,433
Uncle Wang, happy birthday!

86
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,300
Thank you.

87
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,666
Open it. Do you like it?

88
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,000
like

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,433
It's expensive, isn't it?

90
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,133
Manager Wang,

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Mr. Leng,

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,400
Manager Wang,

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,533
I've heard about you.

94
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Ouyang Yuchuan doesn't want a talent like you.

95
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,866
I won't miss it.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
Follow me to Leng's house.

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,133
For the price Ouyang Yuchuan gave you,

98
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,866
I won't lose a penny.

99
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,300
Mr. Leng,

100
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:54,600
it's not because of the money.

101
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,833
To be a perfect manager,

102
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,633
you can't do it without the boss's permission,

103
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,633
Leaving without permission,

104
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:00,833
sir,
