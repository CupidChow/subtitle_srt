1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:07,433
Little rabbit,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,733
I heard that you don't have a place to live,

4
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,233
I don't have a place to stay.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,433
Ouyang Yuchuan,

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,733
it's you again.

7
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,633
Come down.

8
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,866
I admit that I had prejudice against Ouyang Yuchuan at first,

9
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,766
when I first met him, he was pompous and arrogant,

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,233
But as I got along with him,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
I found that he was a simple and kind person.

12
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,033
I fell in love with the person I used to hate.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,300
Sir,

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,300
I have a stomachache all of a sudden,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,866
I need to go to the bathroom first.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Go ahead.

17
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,600
Did you lose your life just now?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,500
You don't want to die, do you?

19
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,033
I'm your brother.

20
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,766
If you help them,

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
my brother won't do such a crazy thing.

22
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,033
They really love each other,

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,233
they really love each other.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,533
I'm just a joke.

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,233
All these years,

26
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,400
I've been living in his shadow, not as good as him.

27
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,266
So you went after Miss Su on purpose.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,000
You even did such a ridiculous thing?

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,133
Are you still my old brother?

30
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,233
What else can I use to defeat Ouyang Yuchuan?

31
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,633
Can you stop doing stupid things?

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,233
Brother, you're the only family I have left.

33
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,566
I'm begging you, please stop doing stupid things.

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,966
She hasn't been in this world for a few days.

35
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:33,966
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,133
Let me tell you the truth,

38
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,666
she's not from this world at all.

39
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,900
A few days ago, I was molested by barbaric fans,

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
I got hurt and she saved me.

41
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,566
I saw with my own eyes that her arms were disappearing bit by bit.

42
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,266
She told me that herself.

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,900
-Crazy. -Crazy. You're all crazy.

44
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,566
You lied to your brother

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,400
to help them make up such a story.

46
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,033
Believe it or not,

47
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,266
sir, are you all right?

48
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,733
I'm fine.

49
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,233
Mr. Leng is so hateful.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,766
I can't believe he did such a thing.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,933
Hold on.

52
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:41,100
Fang Ye,

53
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
you weren't there just now.

54
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,300
How do you know?

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
It's Mr. Leng.

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
Forget it. It's over.

57
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:57,866
We're hungry.

58
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
I'm going home for lunch.

59
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't want anything

60
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,733
to get in the way of Bunny and me.

61
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Yes.

63
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,500
Thank you, sir.

64
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:10,866
Thank you, Miss Su.

65
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:11,666
Let's go.

66
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,266
Understand each other, appreciate each other,

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,633
discover each other's strengths,

68
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,700
To tolerate each other's shortcomings,

69
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,900
it's all because of love.

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
It never occurred to me

71
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,300
that a set-up relationship,

72
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,233
It's so sweet.

73
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:52,833
Little rabbit,

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,766
just accept this setting.

75
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,533
Not really.

76
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,766
Exactly

77
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,033
Your sincerity touched me.

78
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,500
The bunny is praising me.

79
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,333
You've changed.

80
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:23,733
If,

81
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,366
if time stays here,

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,733
How good would that be?

83
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:52,400
Ouyang Yuchuan,

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
let me see you smile again.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Goodbye,

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,733
Ouyang Yuchuan,

87
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,200
Goodbye.

88
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,866
Little rabbit. Little rabbit.

89
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,166
Little rabbit.

90
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:08,500
Mr. Su,

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Mr. Su,

92
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,166
What changes do you have to make to this show?

93
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,466
Show me the ending.

94
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,700
Okay. Let's put down the last episode.
