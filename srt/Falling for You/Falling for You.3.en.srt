1
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,200
I want to take an ugly photo of you.

2
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:08,433
Send it to Yuchuan,

3
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,366
I'll ruin your reputation,

4
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,133
Fine, fine. Draw it.

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,566
Unload it for me after you finish it.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,300
-Thank you. -Come on, Su

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,666
Shengnan.

8
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:18,966
Don't think I don't dare to do that.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,033
How dare you? How dare you.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm in a hurry,

11
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,466
too. Hurry up and come.

12
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,033
I don't understand.

13
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,300
How can I compare with you in my family?

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,800
Why does he like you?

15
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,233
I don't understand.

16
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,300
What do you think is better than me?

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,833
Come here.

18
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:41,333
You do it.

19
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:45,933
I don't understand.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,233
What's better about your body and appearance than mine?

21
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,433
Why does he like me

22
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,300
instead of you?

23
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,033
I think this setting,

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,733
from beginning to end, is always a problem.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,033
In principle, you two should be a couple.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Am I right?

27
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:00,100
That's right.

28
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:01,766
That makes sense.

29
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,000
Of course.

30
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,033
No,

31
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:10,866
Su Shengnan, let me tell you,

32
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,400
We're rivals in love now,

33
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:13,333
so don't try to fool me.

34
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:14,600
Me

35
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,666
Miss, Mr. Leng is here.

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,100
Wait and see!

37
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,233
I'll come back to clean you up.

38
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:22,566
I'll wait. I'll wait.

39
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:31,733
Brother, why are you here?

40
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:35,500
Who told you to do that?

41
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,100
If she bullies me,

42
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,466
I'll give it back.

43
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,100
Not only will I ruin her face,

44
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,633
but I'll also let her clean the toilet.

45
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:46,400
Yan'er,

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,066
Miss Su is not as miserable as you said.

47
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,300
If that's okay,

48
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,800
I'd like her

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,433
to be your sister-in-law,

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,333
Brother, are you crazy?

51
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,066
She's my rival in love.

52
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,000
As the saying goes,

53
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:06,600
Should a rival in love be resolved rather than married?

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,133
She married me.

55
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,200
Ouyang Yuchuan,

56
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,166
it's yours now.

57
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,100
You're right.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,466
All right,

59
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,666
that witch is yours now.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,466
I'm leaving.

61
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:32,300
Untie it now.

62
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,133
Thank you.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,866
My name is Leng Feng.

64
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:43,400
I often hear Miss Su's name at school.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,400
I didn't expect that the first time we met was on such an occasion,

66
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:48,633
and I also knew you.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
Are you the number 2 male student?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,333
It's really my pleasure.

69
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:58,633
Miss Su,

70
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,300
are you looking for a place to live?

71
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,300
I was kicked out.

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Since Miss Su offended the Ouyang family,

73
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,533
no one would dare to

74
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,066
rent the house to Miss Su.

75
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,266
In that case,

76
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:16,333
I do have a place,

77
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:17,366
Of course.

78
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,733
Not as luxurious as Ouyang's.

79
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,833
But,

80
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,133
to shield Miss Su from the wind and rain,

81
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:23,600
A place to sleep peacefully.

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,533
That's great.

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
And Leng Yan did this to you,

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,666
as a brother,

85
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,266
I'm here.

86
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,700
-Apologize to you. -It's okay. You're

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,466
welcome.

88
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,666
This is the key to that place.

89
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,466
Thank you, Brother Feng.

90
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,333
then

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,733
I'll pay you back the rent then.

92
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:44,166
Bye.

93
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,133
Do you know where it is?

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,033
I really don't know where it is.

95
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,066
Why don't you give me a ride?

96
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,833
My bunny is leaving me.

97
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:03,766
Sir,

98
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,300
you are the only son of Ouyang Family.

99
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,233
In this world,

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
she can't leave the person you want to keep.

101
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,033
Oh, I see.

102
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:18,366
Don't worry, sir.

103
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,233
As long as we can find the Heart of Stallone,

104
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,400
Miss Su,

105
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,333
I'm sure I'll adore you for thanking you.

106
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,033
No matter what it takes.

107
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,566
We must find the Heart of Stallone.

108
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,566
Sir,

109
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,233
what's wrong with you?

110
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,700
It's really shining.

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,200
Sir,

112
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,000
everything is arranged.

113
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:19,366
Let's go.

114
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,700
Sir, where are we going?

115
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,466
I'm going to have lunch with my bunny.

116
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,433
The Heart of Stallone,

117
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:51,766
what is this?

118
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:55,466
Ouyang Yuchuan, why are you looking for it?

119
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,666
I only know that it's a very important thing.

120
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,900
It seems to have something to do with Miss Su.

121
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,666
If it's for Miss Su,

122
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,966
I have to find it before Ouyang Yuchuan does.
