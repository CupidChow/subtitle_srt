1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,566
Sir,

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
don't come to the kitchen anymore.

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,266
Just leave these things to me.

5
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,766
Miss Su likes to be independent,

6
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:26,233
and do her own thing.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,600
So I'm going to start by making breakfast.

8
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,266
Uncle Wang,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
I may have to ask you to hide for a while.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,700
When Bunny and I finish dinner and go to the college together,

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,533
can you come out again?

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Sure,

13
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:51,666
go ahead.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,833
Little rabbit,

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,366
how does it taste?

16
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,333
It's pretty good.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,666
What about the clue

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,500
to the Heart of Stallone?

19
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,733
I'm going to be angry.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,733
I'll put up with you till tonight,

21
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,066
of course,

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,600
We have the key information.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,533
There's nothing I, Ouyang Yuchuan, can't do.

24
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,366
Excuse me.

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Don't you know breaking into a house is illegal?

26
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:32,800
Mr. Ouyang,

27
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,233
we're doing measurement work

28
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,333
for the owner of this new house,

29
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,200
Please cooperate with me.

30
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:37,833
What?

31
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,500
When did I invite you to do the measurement?

32
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,333
Don't you know?

33
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,566
The house has been sold.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,866
You are no longer the owner of this place.

35
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,700
Please move out immediately.

36
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,266
Who are you?

37
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,400
Get the hell out of here!

38
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,133
Old man, you're the ones who should get out of here, right?

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,333
Uncle Wang,

40
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,333
don't argue with these workers yet,

41
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:55,700
When I get back,

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,133
I'll ask my father about it,

43
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:01,266
You'd better ask your dad what's going on.

44
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:05,266
Manager Wang,

45
00:02:07,466 --> 00:02:08,400
you're here

46
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:10,200
to help with the kitchen,

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,666
-Yes. -Help the

48
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,433
kitchen.

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,533
It's quite delicious.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:22,900
Father,

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,100
a group of people came to the old house today

52
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:26,733
and said that our old house was sold,

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,366
That's true.

54
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,233
Why?

55
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:30,800
Is our family short of money?

56
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,333
The most important thing our family needs is money.

57
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,000
But the amount offered by the buyer

58
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:39,000
is really hard for me to refuse.

59
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:41,866
Sir,

60
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:43,566
Master,

61
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,600
This ancient mansion is a witness to Ouyang's family's business.

62
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,533
It symbolizes the glory of the family. You

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,833
can't sell it.

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,833
I'm a businessman.

65
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,300
As long as I can make more money,

66
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,033
is to give the family the greatest glory.

67
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,366
In half an hour,

68
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,833
the buyer will check in.

69
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,500
Take them to pack up.

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,066
Tell that silly girl to move out right now!

71
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:09,933
Yes

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Su Shengnan, I'm talking to you.

73
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll give you one minute to move out of here.

74
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,733
You didn't help me clean it up and you asked me to move it?

75
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,566
My goodness,

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,433
Miss Leng,

77
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,400
What are you doing in my house?

78
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,166
Ouyang, what are you talking about?

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,433
This is our wedding room.

80
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,000
Have you lost your mind to me?

81
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,266
Ouyang's brother and uncle haven't told you yet?

82
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,900
What?

83
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,700
My brother has bought this place.

84
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:51,300
This will be our wedding room from now on.

85
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,000
Brother,

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,366
How can you spend so much money

87
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,533
on an old mansion again?

88
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,033
I bought it for you.

89
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,733
I have enough houses.

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,566
I don't want that old mansion, do I?

91
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,266
You must have been cheated.

92
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,000
Silly girl,

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
that's the wedding room

94
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:13,933
I bought for you,

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,466
Yes.

96
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,366
That old mansion.

97
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,133
Symbolizing the glory of Ouyang's family,

98
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,266
I bought it at a high price,

99
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,666
Then I'll send it to Ouyang's family.

100
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,933
To prove my approval of this marriage.

101
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,400
So you've been caring about me.

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,266
Silly. So, as the hostess,

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,433
you should move in.

104
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:41,866
Am I right?

105
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,033
I'm not going.

106
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,933
Because Su Shengnan is there,

107
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:46,866
I don't want to see her.

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,600
That's why I'm not going.

109
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:49,966
It's fine if you don't go.

110
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,266
Anyway, that house

111
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:57,866
will be Su Shengnan and Ouyang Yuchuan's wedding room.

112
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,966
No way.

113
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,233
I'll go then.

114
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,633
That's right.

115
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,200
You're indeed my brother's good sister.

116
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,933
Be good. Go ahead.

117
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,800
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

118
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,766
Yes, yes, yes.

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,466
Miss Leng,

120
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,333
what's wrong?

121
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,033
Even if your Leng family buys this old house,

122
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,166
I won't marry you.

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,500
After all, this woman

124
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,200
is my exclusive love.

125
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:44,966
I'm so pissed off.
