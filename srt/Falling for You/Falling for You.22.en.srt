1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:07,366
Little rabbit.

3
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:14,433
What's wrong

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,100
with your left hand?

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,066
It seems that time is running out.

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,066
What time?

7
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,366
It's almost time.

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,533
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:28,400
Yuchuan,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,233
I told you before,

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,666
I'm not from your world.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,766
The key for me to leave this world,

13
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,600
is to find the Heart of Stallone,

14
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,533
The heart of Stallone is the heart of true love,

15
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,000
and when you find true love,

16
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,900
I'm about to leave here.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,600
So you're afraid of affecting me?

18
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,966
What you said to Leng Feng,

19
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,066
you said it to me on purpose.

20
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,833
I'm afraid that after you know the truth,

21
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,266
you'll do something stupid,

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,366
I'm even more scared.

23
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,166
This fruitless love will make you regret for the rest of your life.

24
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:14,566
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
What matters is that we're still together, aren't we?

26
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,900
We're still together.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,600
That's right.

28
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,300
Why is it so dark?

29
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,166
Why didn't you turn on the light?

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Ouyang,

31
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,200
Shengnan,

32
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,566
What's going on?

33
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,933
Ouyang, is that you?

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
What's wrong with you today?

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Goddess,

36
00:01:58,766 --> 00:01:59,766
who are you?

37
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:01,000
Let go of me!

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,233
Don't come over. I'll tell you.

39
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:05,766
Who am I?

40
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,833
I gave up my family for you and separated my wife.

41
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,066
I'll tell you who I am.

42
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:09,900
What does it

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,133
have to do with me?

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
If it weren't for you,

45
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,566
I would be like this.

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
I'll tell you who I am today.

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,000
-Don't come near me. -Listen to me, Yanyan.

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,166
What are

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,633
you doing?

50
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,300
Yanyan, listen to me.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,033
Don't be afraid.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,200
Let go of me!

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,833
Yanyan,

54
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,100
what are you doing?

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,300
Do you know how much I like you?

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,500
What does it have to do with me?

57
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:28,000
You know what?

58
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,000
Every one of your albums,

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,333
let go of me!

60
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,800
I'll buy all the products you endorse.

61
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,766
All the list ones in your live streaming room are me,

62
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,033
I don't need you to buy anything,

63
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,033
I lost everything for you.

64
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,300
I have nothing left.

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,800
Don't come near me. I'm telling you,

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,066
I have nothing left.

67
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,233
I'm telling you not to come over.

68
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,933
You're all I have left.

69
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,600
What are you doing?

70
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,033
Help!

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Brother,

72
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:56,066
misunderstanding, misunderstanding,

73
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:57,400
Brother,

74
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,266
Yanyan, wait for me.

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,633
I will definitely come back.

76
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:03,466
It's okay. It's okay.

77
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,466
It's okay.

78
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,466
It's okay now.

79
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,133
Are you okay?

80
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,566
Shengnan,

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,633
thank you so much today.

82
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,066
If it weren't for you,

83
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,133
I would have been ruined today.

84
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,466
As for what happened before,

85
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,033
I was always jealous of you and Yuchuan,

86
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,700
I even tried to harm you.

87
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,933
It's really my fault.

88
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,033
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,433
It's okay.

90
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,766
It's all in the past.

91
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
What about you?

92
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,666
It's because I care too much about your brother Yuchuan.

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,500
Actually, I also know that he doesn't like me.

94
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,700
But I just don't know why I always want to

95
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,266
get close to him. That's because,

96
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,233
This is Yan Yan

97
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,166
who was set up.

98
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,066
I have one thing I hope you can promise me.

99
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,033
Shengnan, I'll promise you

100
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,366
whatever you say.

101
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,533
In this world,

102
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:18,866
Besides Manager Wang,

103
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,600
only you know your brother Yuchuan the best.

104
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,900
To understand his true nature.

105
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,766
I know how sincere he is to people.

106
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,466
I know how sincere he is to me.

107
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,000
so

108
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,466
I hope that one day, if I leave,

109
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,766
you can still take care of him like before.

110
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,200
Shengnan,

111
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,266
what are you talking about?

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,200
Why did you leave?

113
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
I won't hide it from you.

114
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,433
Actually,

115
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,733
I'm not from your world at all.

116
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,233
In a few days,

117
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,033
I'm going to be in this world,

118
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,133
It has completely disappeared.

119
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,200
Shengnan,

120
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,966
although I don't know why you left,

121
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,266
But I know you must have your reasons.

122
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,366
Well,

123
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,566
I really can't bear to leave you.

124
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,300
After spending so much time with you,

125
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,866
I really admire you.

126
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,200
Look at your courage to love and hate,

127
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,466
your independence and self-improvement,

128
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,766
I don't have any of these.

129
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,466
And I can tell,

130
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,233
Ouyang only has you in his heart,

131
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,466
Even if you leave,

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,300
he will never fall in love with anyone.

133
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,666
All right. Why did you bring him up?

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,833
He's a fool.

135
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,066
Even if all the women in the world

136
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,666
are set to like me.

137
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,033
But the only one I love

138
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,900
in my heart is Bunny.

139
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,033
Shut up!

140
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:52,366
Annoying.

141
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:55,900
So you're afraid of affecting me?

142
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,366
What you said to Leng Feng,

143
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,633
you said it to me on purpose.

144
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:03,300
I'm afraid that after you know the truth,

145
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,500
you'll do something stupid,

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm even more scared.

147
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:11,500
This fruitless love will make you regret for the rest of your life.

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,900
It doesn't matter.

149
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,833
What matters is that we're still together, aren't we?

150
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,033
We're still together.

151
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:19,600
That's right.

152
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,400
It turns out I was the one

153
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,366
who was tricked.

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,733
Mr. Leng,

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,866
it seems that Miss Su

156
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,500
is already with Ouyang Yuchuan.

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,666
So our cooperation

158
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,200
is over, isn't it?

159
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,800
What I can't get,

160
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,566
Ouyang Yuchuan won't get it either.

161
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,600
One last thing for me.

162
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,600
Mr. Leng,

163
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,366
I won't do anything that involves human life.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
You don't need to do it yourself.

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,933
You just need to take them to the place I arranged.

166
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,766
I'll do it myself.

167
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,733
When it's done,

168
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,766
I'll give you double.

169
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:43,066
Since Mr. Leng is so sincere,

170
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
