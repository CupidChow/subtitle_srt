1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:07,600
You live such a good life.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,233
As a father,

4
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:10,500
I'm satisfied.

5
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:11,966
This guy,

6
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,766
why are you two together?

7
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:15,766
Shengnan,

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,466
don't be angry.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,133
Listen to me.

10
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,900
It's uncle.

11
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:21,133
He found me.

12
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,400
Then she mentioned

13
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,133
her own daughter

14
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:27,866
to me. You,

15
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,066
Come home with me now

16
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:30,966
and get married.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,600
No,

18
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,100
you're not my father.

19
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,233
Who are you to meddle in my business?

20
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,633
I don't need you to worry about me.

21
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,200
My daughter,

22
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:39,700
Brother Ouyang,

23
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,333
Because I showed up,

24
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,500
you lost face in front of your colleagues.

25
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:45,833
Are you angry?

26
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,733
I don't care if your name is Su Li,

27
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,866
or if you want to be Su Shengnan?

28
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,766
As long as your surname is Su.

29
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,133
Mr. Leng gave me money

30
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,133
to pay off my gambling debts.

31
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,666
That's like saving my life.

32
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,366
Saving a life is better than building a seven-floor pagoda.

33
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,933
I'll repay you with a spring of water.

34
00:00:59,233 --> 00:00:59,766
Besides,

35
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:00,833
Mr. Leng has always liked you

36
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,300
and treated you well.

37
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,133
It's hard to find a son-in-law like him with a lantern.

38
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:03,733
Am I right, Young Master?

39
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,300
What do you mean by "Young Master"?

40
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,066
Shengnan, listen to me.

41
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,666
Here's the thing,

42
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,600
uncle found me

43
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,133
and you said uncle,

44
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:12,766
You have a lot of face.

45
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,766
He also took the money.

46
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,666
He felt embarrassed,

47
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:16,866
that's why

48
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,366
he agreed

49
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:19,600
to our marriage,

50
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,233
It's okay. It's not your fault.

51
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,600
Let me think about it.

52
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,400
It's my fault for Shengnan,

53
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,433
for not informing you in advance.

54
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,033
Shengnan,

55
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,366
if you don't want to,

56
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,333
I won't force you.

57
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:30,833
But to do something for you,

58
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,166
I'm willing to do anything.

59
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:40,733
Father-in-law,

60
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,066
can you decide my marriage with Bunny?

61
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Ouyang Yuchuan,

62
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,400
shut up. This is

63
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,666
for your brother Ouyang,

64
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,566
I'm your fiancée.

65
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,433
I don't want a bride price.

66
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,600
Okay Let's do this,

67
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,000
Sir Since you've already received the money,

68
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
Go back and live a good life.

69
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:01,033
I'll figure out a way to deal with the money,

70
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,766
so don't gamble anymore, okay?

71
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,333
What's wrong

72
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:07,833
with you?

73
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,466
You still want to stay here,

74
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,466
don't you? I'm better than men.

75
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,933
Let uncle go to my new house first,

76
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,166
and then I'll figure out a way,

77
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,666
I'll take uncle to pick a new room first.

78
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:19,966
This way, this way,

79
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,200
my home has my home,

80
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:22,966
my home has that,

81
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:24,900
Shengnan, I'm leaving.

82
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:26,100
You … You … Listen to me.

83
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,133
I'm impressed.

84
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:36,866
Eat fruits and food.

85
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll mess with anyone.

86
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll do it, guys.

87
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:43,966
White truffle,

88
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,033
white truffle with pure white marbles,

89
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,600
When you smell it,

90
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,633
how can I describe it to you

91
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,166
with a charming fragrance?

92
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:54,166
It's like Yuan Ye's breath.

93
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,833
It smells like fallen leaves,

94
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,700
acorn roots and earth.

95
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,266
This is an award-winning Italian chef.

96
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,166
Martifikni,

97
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:03,666
with grace and romance,

98
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,433
A brand new item

99
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:06,700
for truffle lovers,

100
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,366
It only costs 888, 888

101
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:10,800
per 100 grams,

102
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,166
You must give it to the most important person in your life.

103
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Come on, guys,

104
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,266
isn't this the white truffle

105
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,533
Ouyang has been longing for?

106
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,666
Link on 321,

107
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,300
place an order,

108
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,733
I'm here.

109
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,233
Miss Leng, right?

110
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,000
-Your delivery? -Hey, what's

111
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,233
your attitude?

112
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,200
How dare you throw such a valuable thing on the floor?

113
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:34,700
What's wrong?

114
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,033
Ouyang,

115
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,066
guess what I bought for you?

116
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,400
What?

117
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:39,600
Take a look.

118
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,000
Here. This is truffle soup I made myself.

119
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,066
Your white truffle soup

120
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,133
tastes a bit strange.

121
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,033
Is it wrong?

122
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,766
How could it be?

123
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,400
This is made by Martifikni,

124
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,400
a 10-star chef.

125
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,733
I'm just heating it up.

126
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:13,633
It won't be a problem.

127
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:14,766
I'll get the spoon.

128
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,833
Such top-notch ingredients are delivered by express delivery.

129
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,600
And it's not fresh-keeping.

130
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,633
Why?

131
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,500
Ouyang Yuchuan,

132
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,200
you made it?

133
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:31,800
Me,

134
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,200
Su Shengnan,

135
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,300
I personally prepared truffle soup for Yuchuan.

136
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,366
Why should you drink it?

137
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,233
You are not allowed to drink it.

138
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:42,233
How about I spit it out for you?

139
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,166
You're so disgusting.

140
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,566
Ouyang, don't worry. This truffle soup

141
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,600
has to be served

142
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,700
with Starusta red wine to be strong enough.

143
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:55,833
I'll get it for you.

144
00:04:59,433 --> 00:04:59,933
Tell me,

145
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,500
what's the progress of the Heart of Stallone?

146
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,366
It is said that my biological mother

147
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,966
once found

148
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,900
the Heart of Stallone.

149
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,866
It does taste a little different.

150
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,366
Don't interrupt.

151
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,633
Every time it comes to a critical moment, it turns off the engine.
