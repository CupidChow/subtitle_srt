1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Uncle Wang,

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,166
Bunny

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,566
has been a little cold to me lately,

5
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:14,966
Is there any way

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,200
to get her into my arms?

7
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,000
Sir,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,300
I've prepared it for you.

9
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,100
What?

10
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,166
As an old man,

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,800
it's not appropriate for me to watch such a vulgar film.

12
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:48,733
Sir, compared to elegant art,

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,066
the audio-visual of this kind of film is really too intense.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,633
Didn't you say that?

15
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,000
You can do anything

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,300
for Miss Su.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,200
All right,

18
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,266
for Miss Su's sake,

19
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,200
I accept your offer.

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,366
But, sir,

21
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:07,566
let me remind you,

22
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,200
Be sure to turn off the lights

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,700
in the dead of night,

24
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,600
Close the curtains,

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,733
and invite Miss Su to watch it with you.

26
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,166
Miss Su,

27
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:23,300
she will fall into your arms automatically.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:13,966
Hey,

29
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:15,800
What are you doing?

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,666
Su Shengnan,

31
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,266
he's my fiancé.

32
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,600
Why did you hug him?

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,533
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

34
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,333
Su Shengnan, turn on the light. I'm not going.

35
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,100
You go.

36
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,166
You go.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,033
Go ahead. Go ahead.

38
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:47,500
Go by yourself.

39
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:48,400
Stop arguing.

40
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:50,600
I'll go.

41
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,000
Little rabbit,

42
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,933
don't be afraid.

43
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,233
Nothing. Nothing.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,033
Stop howling.

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,600
Yuchuan,

46
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,133
why do you only care about her?

47
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,400
We are an unmarried couple.

48
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,666
Let's go!

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,866
Its name.

50
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:40,800
And then?

51
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,700
It's Uncle Wang's dog.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,866
Manager Wang. Yes,

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,866
Manager Wang.

54
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,066
Manager Wang, you can give a dog such a weird name.

55
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,200
Except for Mr. Ouyang,

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,066
I don't think anyone has such a name.

57
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:55,200
No.

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,200
No, no,

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,466
no. What a cute puppy.

60
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,300
Ouyang, you're so kind, aren't you?
