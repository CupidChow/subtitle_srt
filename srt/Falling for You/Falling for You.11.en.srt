1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
.

2
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,633
Stallone's heart is hidden in the old mansion.

3
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,600
But it will only appear automatically after a certain period of time.

4
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:21,366
Little rabbit,

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,366
I'm not lying to you.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,033
I sneaked into my family's library,

7
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,733
and found out that in our family,

8
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,366
Someone has seen the Heart of Stallone,

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,400
so we need to be patient enough to wait for it to appear.

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,833
It's not easy being a popular idol.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,500
Only by exercising every day,

12
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,866
can you keep slim.

13
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,966
Yuchuan, help me correct

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,033
my warm-up posture.

15
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:48,266
What do you think?

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,333
Little rabbit,

17
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,966
feed the little rabbit,

18
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:54,900
Yuchuan,

19
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,333
wait for me.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,800
Bunny,

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
you're right.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,933
Self-discipline.

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
It can really bring vitality to the day.

24
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,900
We, Mr. Ouyang, must do our best.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,600
Hang in there for a long time.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,733
When I think about running with Yuchuan in the morning,

27
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:27,066
I'm very happy.

28
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,166
Bunny, wait for me.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,066
Yuchuan, wait for me.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,933
My lady, slow down.

31
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,533
Su Shengnan, pour me a cup of tea,

32
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,766
but you can't pour it yourself.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,833
I should do it for you.

34
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,666
For Ouyang's sake,

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,766
I allowed you to live here.

36
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,133
Yeah And then what?

37
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,133
Ouyang, come here.

38
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,666
This is the love breakfast I prepared for you.

39
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,866
Don't eat her junk food.

40
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:21,966
What do you know?

41
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,400
Although they can't afford

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,300
Alba white truffles and Emma caviar,

43
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,733
But they have carrots, eggs and potatoes

44
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,566
with similar nutritional value, which can be seen everywhere.

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,433
And this simple way, everywhere reveals

46
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:40,766
the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people.

47
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,266
Ouyang Yuchuan,

48
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,133
can't you take care of your fiancée?

49
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't slander me.

50
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,766
I've never admitted my engagement.

51
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:40,300
You are the only one in my heart.

52
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,300
Leng Yan,

53
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm still sleeping if you don't sleep.

54
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,466
Yes, of course people like you have to go to bed early.

55
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,933
Stars like us have to practice hard,

56
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,133
and we can't waste such a quiet night.

57
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,233
Otherwise, how could my career be so brilliant?

58
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,500
With your broken voice,

59
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,000
are you going to end your career?

60
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,266
Leave me alone.

61
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,133
Sleep on your sleep.

62
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:04,933
I'll sing my song,

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,800
Bunny.

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
When will

65
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,733
the Heart of Stallone appear?

66
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,266
Su Shengnan,

67
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,633
don't go too far.

68
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:06,733
What have I done?

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,633
We stupid birds have to get up early.

70
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,133
Then hurry up and study.

71
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,366
Unlike people like you,

72
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,366
what time is it now?

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,666
You're still sleeping here.

74
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,933
Su Shengnan, don't go too far.

75
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:19,966
Is it too much?

76
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,233
Come on. Let's dance together.

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,333
These books are all in the wrong place.

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,466
What if you do things like this?

79
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,333
It's better not to do it.

80
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,233
We must be careful next time.

81
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,200
Okay. Sister Su Su,

82
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,366
you must check it carefully next time.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,866
Yes.

84
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,333
Go ahead. Put it over there.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,533
Sis Susu,

86
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:46,933
your dad is here to see you.

87
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:51,533
Honey,

88
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,633
I've been looking for you so hard.

89
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
You even changed your phone number?

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,433
Why didn't you tell me?

91
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you know how worried I am about you?

92
00:05:59,533 --> 00:05:59,933
No,

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,066
sir, you mistook me for someone else.

94
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,266
I'm not your daughter.

95
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:06,733
Sir,
