1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,100
Give it to me.

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,100
This is mine.

3
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:08,766
Give it to me

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,400
-Mine. -Let go.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,200
It's really you.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,766
How do you explain this?

7
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,433
My boyfriend gave it to me.

8
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,000
Give it back to me.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,133
Go!

10
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,033
Stop it, all of you!

11
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,700
My little rabbit got bullied again.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,600
What can you do without me?

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,033
Manager Wang,

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,433
these people can disappear from the business school.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,500
Yuchuan,

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,533
they didn't do it on purpose.

17
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:52,966
You misunderstood them.

18
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,966
My little rabbit is so kind.

19
00:00:57,466 --> 00:00:58,366
You deserve to be my exclusive favorite.

20
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:08,866
Stop.

21
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:14,466
Look at the photos you took,

22
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,666
spreading some love that depends on the pie in the sky all day,

23
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,200
to save a girl's life.

24
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,733
For those girls whose values have not grown up,

25
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:24,566
what do you think after reading them?

26
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:25,966
What's more,

27
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:30,033
what's there to be attracted to a greasy narcissistic man like him?

28
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,533
President Su, look at this.

29
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:32,933
Based on this data,

30
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:33,466
Shut up!

31
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,300
The evaluation failed.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,733
Do not participate in project investment.

33
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,466
It's really you.

34
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,700
How do you explain this?

35
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,333
Isn't this the drama that was just reviewed?

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,733
You're not talking, are you?

37
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,566
Why are you pretending to be a rabbit?

38
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,433
Go against me if anything happens.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,933
My little rabbit got bullied again.

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,700
What can you do without me?

41
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,266
Sir,

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,666
I don't think that's what you said,

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,033
Behave yourself.

44
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:24,933
Let go of me!

45
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,333
Can a rabbit bite?

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,333
Yes.

47
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,600
I told you to follow me here.

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,266
Are you Ouyang?

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,133
I'm your brother Yuchuan,

50
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,466
don't you recognize me?

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,233
You're crazy.

52
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,566
I have to see it even in my dreams.

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,900
What a bad luck.

54
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:52,500
Me,

55
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,133
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:58,866
Where can I get out of such a big house?

57
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:05,600
Bunny,

58
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,000
are you playing hard to get with me?

59
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,266
But it doesn't matter,

60
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,800
my little rabbit is playing tricks,

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,300
You're still so cute.

62
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,333
Who wrote this line? Disgusting.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,866
Screw your exclusive love.

64
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,366
I told you to pretend.

65
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,733
Do you still think you're handsome?

66
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,966
You still want to

67
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:34,066
kiss me.

68
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:35,800
Get up!

69
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,700
Gosh,

70
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,066
you've had enough fun. I should wake up now.

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,733
The world of Marisu will never be seen again.

72
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,333
What's going on?

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,700
Where are we now?

74
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,933
Producer Su,

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,966
welcome to sweet love comedy.

76
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:06,166
In the world that the president has been relying on,

77
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,300
haven't I run out of this bloody drama yet?

78
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,766
You will replace Su Li in this world

79
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:15,000
and experience the sweet love that Ouyang Yuchuan brings to you,

80
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:15,966
To cure sadomasochism,

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,833
it's him. I hate this kind of person the most.

82
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:19,966
It's impossible.

83
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:21,433
There must be a way out.

84
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,233
Don't fool me.

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,333
Tell me.

86
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,400
If I step on the switch and get struck by lightning or dive into the pit,

87
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,533
how can I get back?

88
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,633
Me.

89
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,800
Before this mark disappears,

90
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,366
you need to find the Heart of Stallone,

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,066
That's why you can leave here.

92
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:40,900
What is this?

93
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,200
Today's morning tea

94
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,500
was two hours ago.

95
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,800
Where's the fruit from the Uwa black tea salad

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,433
we just picked from Sri Lanka by air?

97
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,766
It's strictly monitored in the constant temperature garden of the manor,

98
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,566
every 42 hours,

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Each fruit is watered

100
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,066
with 50 milliliters of New Zealand

101
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,333
goat milk mixed with Snow Mountain water source

102
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,866
for 840 hours. It's too late

103
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,166
to harvest on time.

104
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,200
I really can't hide anything from you, sir.

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,933
I'll fire everyone in the kitchen.

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,300
Forget it.

107
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,733
Today is my first day at work.

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,733
Please spare them.

109
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,333
My little rabbit

110
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,833
can't help but miss me.
