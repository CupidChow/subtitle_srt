1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:07,000
You even changed your phone number.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,033
Why didn't you tell me?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,100
Do you know how worried I am about you?

5
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:10,900
No,

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,100
sir, you mistook me for someone else.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,233
I'm not your daughter.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,633
Sir,

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:19,966
Lili,

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,966
Do you think,

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,900
I came to this unit to embarrass you.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,800
You don't recognize me?

13
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:27,900
My name is Su Shengnan,

14
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:28,900
not Su Li,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,133
You really mistook me for someone else.

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,400
The door is over there. Go by yourself.

17
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,266
Remember to close it for me. Thank you.

18
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,233
Su Sheng,

19
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:36,566
when did you change your name?

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,933
Come and have a look.

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,000
She didn't have a mother since she was a child.

22
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,933
I raised her up with a handful of poop and urine.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,133
Well,

24
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,066
she even changed her name.

25
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,366
You don't recognize me as your father.

26
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Come and have a look.

27
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,366
Oh my god.

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,633
She doesn't even recognize her father.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,600
No, no, no. Her father is a vampire.

30
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:04,000
Every time she comes to school, she comes to ask for money.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,033
Look at her mother,

32
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,300
Get up. Get up.

33
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,033
Tell me. What do you want?

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
You haven't paid me for living expenses for two months

35
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,233
What happened to you, Miss Su?

36
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:19,933
Fang Ye, you're just in time.

37
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:20,800
Do you have any money in your pocket?

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,233
Hurry up!

39
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,700
That's all I have.

40
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,500
Here. Is it enough to take these?

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,266
This … This … This … This … This … This … This is not enough.

42
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:31,000
You're not even paying 1% of the interest.

43
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,066
What interest?

44
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,733
Lili, let me be honest with you.

45
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,400
So I gambled all the money

46
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,233
in our house.

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,733
I just want to make a big profit at a time,

48
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:44,633
but unexpectedly,

49
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,266
I didn't make any big money.

50
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,166
You owe me more and more

51
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:50,333
How much do you owe me?

52
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:50,866
Tell me.

53
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:53,600
Plus interest,

54
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,966
it comes to 300 thousand,

55
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,633
300 thousand,

56
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:57,866
I can't afford to pay it back.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Goodbye. Goodbye.

58
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Girl,

59
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:02,333
for you,

60
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,200
I've done everything for you now.

61
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,433
I have nothing left.

62
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,866
If you don't care about me,

63
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,833
my father will only die.

64
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:10,833
-I'm dead. -No, no,

65
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:11,566
no.

66
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,233
All right, all right.

67
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,066
Take the money first.

68
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,200
I'll figure something else out then, okay?

69
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Go back first.

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,733
All right. Let's go.

71
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,966
Where did such a father come from?

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,033
I'm so impressed.

73
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,733
Thank you, Ziye.

74
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,033
I'll pay you back then.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,700
You're welcome, Miss Su.

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,833
Do you want to tell Mr. Ouyang about this?

77
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,100
Don't stop.

78
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,033
I'll figure out a way

79
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,266
to go home myself.

80
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,000
Mr. Leng,

81
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,200
this time,

82
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,300
I brought you a message worth 50thousand yuan.

83
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,533
Oh,

84
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,200
Does it have anything to do with Stallone's heart?

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
It has something to do with Miss Su.

86
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,666
Her father came to ask her for money again.

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,533
What kind of news is this?

88
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,233
That old beggar has been to the office before,

89
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,566
but this time it's different.

90
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,433
I heard that

91
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,500
Father Su owes a lot of gambling debts.

92
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,500
They can't afford it for now.

93
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,766
So what?

94
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,400
Gamblers

95
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,300
don't have any moral bottom line.

96
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,900
If we use him,

97
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,400
Mr. Leng will be in charge of

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
the secret of the Heart of Stallone and Miss Su.

99
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:48,766
It's good news.

100
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,100
Mr. Leng,

101
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,333
do you think this message is worth 50thousand?

102
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,433
I'll give you 100 thousand.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,133
Thank you, Mr. Leng.

104
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,066
Sir,

105
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,200
this is Miss Su's father.

106
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
Shengnan is such a delicate girl,

107
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,733
how can he have such a sloppy father

108
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,166
to wake him up.

109
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,833
Two brothers,

110
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,133
two brothers, please spare me.

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,466
Can you bear with me for a few more days?

112
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,800
After my daughter marries into a rich family,

113
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,566
I promise I'll pay her back twice.

114
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll pay you back three times, okay?

115
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,533
Three times. Three times.

116
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,600
Uncle,

117
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:55,200
Yes.

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Hello,

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,933
Hello,

120
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm Shengnan's colleague,

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
and you,

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,133
Are you really Su Li's colleague?

123
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, my name is Leng Feng.

124
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,566
As an admirer of her company,

125
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm very happy to see you.

126
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Leng Feng,

127
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,900
don't you know the Leng family?

128
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,300
The Leng family,

129
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,666
who doesn't know?

130
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,033
In this city,

131
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,033
the only one who can compete with Ouyang Family,

132
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,033
The Leng family is the only one left.

133
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:25,133
Could it be

134
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you really Mr. Leng Fengleng?

135
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:29,966
Nice to meet you, Mr. Leng.

136
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,166
Nice to meet you.

137
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,366
Nice to meet you.

138
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:39,800
Just now, you said

139
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,566
that

140
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:43,933
you admire my daughter,

141
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,700
I've finally come to my senses.

142
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,900
Did she ask you to come?

143
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,400
No, no.

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,233
Shengnan is very busy with work and study at work,

145
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,800
but this time it's me,

146
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:57,566
You're so presumptuous

147
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,800
that you're here to visit you.

148
00:05:59,466 --> 00:05:59,966
Look, look,

149
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,133
I'm so sorry.

150
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,633
Look at me now.

151
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,600
Without your education,

152
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,033
Shengnan wouldn't be so good.

153
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,033
Where?

154
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,033
This is our first meeting,

155
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,800
so I brought you a little bit of care.

156
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:15,166
Look at what you said. I'm so sorry.

157
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Well,

158
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,300
it's not respectful to prepare a small gift.

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,866
Look,

160
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,833
Su Li, to have a friend like you,

161
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,933
This is such a great honor.

162
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,366
Lucky for you.

163
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,433
Yes, uncle.

164
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,500
If you have any difficulties, just come to Leng's house.

165
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,300
The door of the Leng family is always open for you.

166
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you in such a hurry? Sit down a little longer.

167
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:35,766
We'll get going.

168
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,700
Mr. Leng,

169
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,166
watch your step.

170
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,300
