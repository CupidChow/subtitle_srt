1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,033
. 。

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:08,900
Good morning.

3
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,500
Ouyang Chuan Chuan.

4
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,066
Good morning.

5
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,366
Why early?

6
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,366
I didn't sleep all night.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,100
Shh.

8
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,800
The rabbit is still sleeping.

9
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,333
What are you doing?

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
What happened to us

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,633
last night?

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,900
Yes.

13
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,400
What happened to you guys last night?

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,233
How would I know?

15
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,966
Ouyang Yuchuan, make it clear.

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,400
The influencer's first sister, Jiaqi,

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,700
sold fakes on live streaming,

18
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,633
He has been arrested by the police.

19
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,400
I just feel that mushroom looks the same as Tricholoma matsutake,

20
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,900
but I never thought it's poisonous.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Su Shengnan,

22
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:21,966
I'll let you sleep.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
I wake

24
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:25,800
you up,

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,833
Wasp Wasp

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,833
The cute little wasp,

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,433
Go inside and sting that dead woman into a pig's head.

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,400
What are you doing?

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,066
Oh no.

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,933
Me

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,933
I … I … I … I stabbed the wasp in.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,900
What?

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Little rabbit,

34
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,800
what should we do?

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,700
Little rabbit, don't be afraid.

36
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:49,733
I'll be right there.

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,600
Ouyang,

38
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,100
don't go in. Wasps are too dangerous.

39
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,733
I'm here.

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,733
What's wrong?

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,133
Why are you yelling

42
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,000
so loudly? Ouyang.

43
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,833
Little rabbit,

44
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:21,066
take it easy. Just bear with it.

45
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,533
Ouyang Yuchuan, are you a fool?

46
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,966
You rushed in when you knew there were wasps in the room,

47
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,166
I was worried about you, wasn't I?

48
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,300
But I'm glad you're fine.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,233
Although there was an oolong,

50
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,800
I still have to thank you.

51
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,200
The first time someone risked his life to save me,

52
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,866
I was quite moved.

53
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,033
I'm touched.

54
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:50,600
Ouyang,

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,933
Shengnan,

56
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,133
It's all my fault.

57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,633
Can you forgive me?

58
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,033
I'm sorry

59
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,600
about yesterday,

60
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,166
I really didn't know I would buy poisonous mushrooms.

61
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,033
This is Guffett left by my father when he was alive.

62
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,533
I hope you can accept it.

63
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,366
Miss Leng,

64
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,133
I was quite angry at first,

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,366
But correcting mistakes

66
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,366
is a rare thing.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,900
I'll take it this time.

68
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,233
I don't want you to feel guilty all the time.

69
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:18,666
Yes.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,866
Tell her to take it back. If you don't want it,

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,533
I'll take it back.

72
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,166
Shut up!

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,566
It's been

75
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
so long,

76
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,200
You didn't give me any clues,

77
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,400
brother,

78
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,333
I'm sorry, Yuchuan.

79
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:08,466
What's wrong?

80
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,000
I just want to put a hornet's nest.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,700
I was just trying to scare Su Shengnan.

82
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,733
I didn't expect Ouyang Yuchuan to enter.

83
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,333
Then his face got stung and swollen.

84
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,433
Miss Su, are you okay?

85
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,900
She's fine.

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm glad you're fine.

87
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,400
But Yuchuan,

88
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,200
wait.

89
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:30,766
Tell me,

90
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,800
Ouyang Yuchuan's face

91
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,000
is swollen.

92
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,533
It's swollen.

93
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,766
That's great.

94
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,733
Then there won't be any dispute between us.

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,100
Brother,

96
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,533
What are you talking about?

97
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,766
Nothing.

98
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,166
You should always think about yourself first.

99
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,166
You put everything about me at the last place.

100
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,566
You're not setting us up at all,

101
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,000
you're using me to break up their good brothers

102
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,300
and make fun of them,

103
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,333
Yanyan

104
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,333
Bunny, come on.

105
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
Tiansheng Star is going after Shanghai Chuanxing.

106
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,166
Let me see.

107
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:19,866
A little to the left.

108
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,033
Did you see that?

109
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,333
Where are you?

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,300
See?

111
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,833
Yes, I saw it. I saw it.

112
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:31,966
I saw it. Hey, hey.

113
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,500
Where's Heavenly Star?

114
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,933
Always chasing Haichuan Star,

115
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,866
when Heavenly Saint Star gets closer?

116
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,400
Haichuaxing will stay away from us.

117
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,500
But as long as Heavenly Saint Star approaches faster than Haichuan Star,

118
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:42,766
they will be together.

119
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,766
Like,

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,433
you and I,
