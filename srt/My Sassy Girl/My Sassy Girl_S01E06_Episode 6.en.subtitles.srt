1
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,309
It is raining.

2
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,810
It is raining! Get me the shades.

3
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,896
It is raining. Hurry!

4
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,564
My goodness.

5
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,068
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

6
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,655
Hurry!

7
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,032
My goodness.

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
-Are you all right?
-Master Gyeon.

9
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,052
Your Highness!

10
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,977
Why can he not come to my residence?

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,274
Lieutenant Gang just asked
for a meeting with him alone.

12
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,109
Lieutenant Gang...

13
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,201
The Princess is being chased?

14
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,870
We are running out of time, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,706
We need to hurry and find the Princess.

16
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,000
Where can we find her?

17
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
I have found their base.

18
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,339
Please give me permission
to investigate the Gentry Village.

19
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,763
Do not let anyone know about this.

20
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,601
I shall take only those
who are trustworthy.

21
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,295
You gave this to me already.
Don't be so cheap.

22
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,474
Be quiet. Master Doggy.

23
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,134
Let me see.

24
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,056
Baby, we shall see each other soon.

25
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,976
Is it not pretty?

26
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,729
Our mother made this for us.

27
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,898
-Mother.
-Take her.

28
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,150
-My baby.
-Mother.

29
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,528
-My baby.
-Mother.

30
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,196
Let go of me.

31
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,157
-Mother.
-My baby.

32
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,077
Mother!

33
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
Mother!

34
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,920
Do not go.

35
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,965
Do not leave me.

36
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,129
Is anyone in there?

37
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,006
Come out.

38
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,008
Open the door.

39
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,343
Open the door.

40
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,060
THE BUTCHER'S

41
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,608
Come out!

42
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,339
What... Who...

43
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,468
What brings you here?

44
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,470
-Search everywhere.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,599
Well...

46
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,061
Gosh!

47
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,147
My lord.

48
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,482
Why...

49
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,029
Nothing.

50
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,617
We have found nothing.

51
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,126
Where is the man
with the scar on his face?

52
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,336
Scar?

53
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,464
What do you mean?

54
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,467
If you do not answer honestly,

55
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,844
I shall cut your throat.

56
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,638
I do not know anything.

57
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,183
Please spare me.

58
00:07:55,558 --> 00:08:00,521
I really do not know anything.

59
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,607
Spare me.

60
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,325
-Arrest him.
-Yes, sir.

61
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,370
-Let us go.
-What is wrong?

62
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,039
Sir!

63
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,167
Why are you taking me?

64
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
Are you okay?

65
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,677
You need to treat your wound first.

66
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,557
-We must find the Princess.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,144
Lieutenant Gang.

68
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,444
Gang Jun-yeong?

69
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,576
How did he find out?

70
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,661
My apologies.

71
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,413
He searched the Gentry Village
with his men.

72
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,542
I think the Princess has not returned
to the palace yet.

73
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,297
She has not returned to the palace yet.

74
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,302
We must find her

75
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,680
before Lieutenant Gang does.

76
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,120
-Are you done?
-Yes, master.

77
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,455
Please keep this from my family.

78
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,540
Sure.

79
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,255
Did you check them all?

80
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,675
I could not meet one of them.

81
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,387
What family is she from?

82
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,765
Well... She is different.

83
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,729
The Princess' name is Hyemyeong as well.

84
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,357
The Princess?

85
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,556
Looking at you smiling,
I guess you are all better now.

86
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,977
What happened to my clothes?

87
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,604
Do not tell me...

88
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,980
Well...

89
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,566
I did not do anything.

90
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,359
Gyeon U.

91
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,361
Why did you lock the door?

92
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,740
-Hide!
-What is going on?

93
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,201
Wake up and open the door.

94
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,538
-This. Put it up there.
-Why would you lock the door?

95
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,789
Open it.

96
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,666
Gyeon U!

97
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,460
-Gyeon U!
-Shoes.

98
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,544
Okay.

99
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,339
-Me? What about me?
-Gyeon U.

100
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,341
Gyeon U!

101
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,598
Why did you lock the door?

102
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,642
What were you doing inside?

103
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,648
Why are you making such a fuss
so early in the morning?

104
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,241
I heard you left Mother behind

105
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,284
after siding with the spoiled Princess.
Is that right?

106
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,410
That is nonsense!

107
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,039
I did not.

108
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,042
There is no point in raising kids.

109
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,419
Send him this message.

110
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,755
I am sorry, Mother.

111
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,465
Please do not be upset.

112
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,052
Your mother is here,
but you are still in your bed.

113
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,638
You are not repenting right.

114
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,641
-Send him this message.
-I am sorry, Mother.

115
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,436
I cannot stand up
because my leg fell asleep.

116
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,647
I will visit you later.

117
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,691
Why would you?

118
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,277
Gyeon U.

119
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,821
Whose shoes are they?

120
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,080
They are yours.

121
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,082
Really?

122
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,001
What is gotten into you?

123
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,545
This is why I like my brother.

124
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,088
You are the best.

125
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,009
What? It is not my size.

126
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,435
You will grow into those eventually.

127
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,811
They will fit then.

128
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,570
Are they

129
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,697
really mine?

130
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,825
Sure. It looks good on you.

131
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,957
-I do not think so.
-Yes, it is right.

132
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,967
-I do not think so.
-What?

133
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,762
-What is in there?
-Nothing.

134
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,347
-What?
-Nothing.

135
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,681
What?

136
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,525
Hello.

137
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,114
-Gyeon U...
-Mother, it is not like that.

138
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,034
Are you that sassy girl?

139
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:57,081
What? What are you talking about?
Who is that girl?

140
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,875
Mother, can you not know
after seeing all this?

141
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,210
You are mistaken.

142
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,754
She was in your bed.
What is there to misunderstand?

143
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,839
What a load of crap!

144
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,549
Watch your mouth!

145
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,218
Am I wrong?

146
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,469
What is all the noise?

147
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,513
-Hide!
-My gosh.

148
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,474
Hurry!

149
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,852
What is going on here?

150
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,605
-Father.
-My lord.

151
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,924
Could you keep this from His Majesty?

152
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,010
Please.

153
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,014
Take good care of the Princess.

154
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,976
Then I shall go with you.

155
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,871
Mother wants to see you.

156
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,568
Well...

157
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,446
What does your father do?

158
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,619
He

159
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,121
cares for the country.

160
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,166
My goodness.

161
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,879
Who does not care for this country?

162
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,839
His status.

163
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,967
Is he an official?

164
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,015
He is not exactly an official.

165
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,018
Then he must be jobless.

166
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,104
Okay.

167
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,981
Then

168
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,609
how many rooms are there in your house?

169
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,327
Do I have to count all the rooms?

170
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,665
I thought so. It is one room.

171
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,127
Do not tell me

172
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,796
it is a thatched house.

173
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,928
Why are you asking me these?

174
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,727
My goodness!

175
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,896
This is driving me crazy.

176
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,821
Mother, I am so sleepy.

177
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,158
Prince, you told me
that you miss your sister.

178
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,119
Yes, I do.

179
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,581
The Princess is outside the palace.

180
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,668
Do whatever it takes
to let people know of it.

181
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,316
Where is my sister?

182
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,695
Where is the Princess?

183
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,659
Well... That is...

184
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,876
Chief Scholar Gyeon.

185
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,795
What brings you here with your son?

186
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,841
I have something to tell you.

187
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,178
Yes?

188
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,978
Tell him I am here.

189
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,232
Your Majesty,
the Queen is here to see you.

190
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,320
What is the matter?

191
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,822
My apologies, Your Majesty.

192
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:45,118
I barged in in the middle of
your conversation as it is urgent.

193
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,330
What is it that you are in a hurry?

194
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,295
It is about the Princess.

195
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,132
Princess?

196
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,094
The Princess is not in her residence.

197
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,428
You

198
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,015
ended up going into her room
when I told you not to?

199
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,271
The Prince cried,
saying he missed his sister.

200
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,815
I could not just turn a blind eye to it.

201
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,860
My apologies.

202
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,322
However, I had to tell you
as I found out she disappeared--

203
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,949
She did not disappear.

204
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,411
I sent her away.

205
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,830
What do you mean?

206
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,875
The Princess is in my house,
Your Highness.

207
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,932
She is in your house?

208
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,392
The Princess

209
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,312
seems to be caught in a trap.

210
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,898
I heard some people are after her.

211
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,901
I do not know what they really want,

212
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,195
but I am sure

213
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,489
they will try to harm her again.

214
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,074
Your Majesty.

215
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,285
You should plan ahead.

216
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,309
Sending her away
to Chief Scholar Gyeon's house?

217
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,935
It is still so obvious.

218
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,313
It does not make sense
to send her away while in probation.

219
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,065
As he is cornered,

220
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,192
the King is making decisions
that are very risky.

221
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,612
Are you planning
to let things slide like this?

222
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
This is the best I can do.

223
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,455
I believe this is good enough.

224
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,083
What is this?

225
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,377
Well...

226
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,172
Are you saying this is not enough?

227
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,137
Gosh.

228
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,989
Here.

229
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,077
Do not try to ruin my son
with this incident.

230
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,205
Get off from my brother.

231
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,548
I do not need things like this.

232
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,924
Gosh.

233
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,884
How brazen!

234
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,470
So you cannot give up on my son?

235
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,306
I told you she is something.

236
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,100
Goodness.

237
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,646
What should we do?
Should we sell our house or something?

238
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,276
I think you are mistaken.

239
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,361
Mistaken, my foot.

240
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:09,990
Master Gyeon and I
are not in what you think we are.

241
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,324
Then what?

242
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,288
I owe him a debt.

243
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,456
Do not be deceived.

244
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,419
That girl seems to be normal now,
but she is crazy.

245
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,256
Gosh.

246
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,010
My lady, please come out for a second.

247
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,541
Princess!

248
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,711
Princess!

249
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,338
Why are they looking for
the Princess here?

250
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,505
Your...

251
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,559
What happened to you?

252
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,271
Your Highness, have you been well?

253
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
What?

254
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,069
That girl...

255
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,695
She is...

256
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,575
What brings you here?

257
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,707
Princess?

258
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,293
No way.

259
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,795
Really?

260
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,214
Are you being serious?

261
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,302
You must serve Her Highness
with all your heart.

262
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,138
Why did he not tell us?

263
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,392
She is the Princess, so what?
Why would she drag my son?

264
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,435
What if rumors go out
that he is her future husband?

265
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,187
Stop it.

266
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,691
Why? Is it not good to be her husband?

267
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,276
Not at all.

268
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,444
It will be the end of his career.

269
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,406
End of... Watch what you say.

270
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,285
Whoever she may be, I do not like her.

271
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,338
It is a message from the King.

272
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,467
I am sure you already know
what you have done.

273
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,388
I am not forgiving you
and letting this slide.

274
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,769
Thus, listen to Master Gyeon
while staying in his house

275
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,271
and reflect upon yourself.

276
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,378
I have

277
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,631
finally found out who that sassy girl is.

278
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,132
And?

279
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,594
Whose family is she from
that she did such lowly things?

280
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,554
It is the Princess.

281
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,693
Why are you laughing?

282
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,862
That sassy girl is the Princess?

283
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
That is funny.

284
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,535
So you are saying she came to the festival

285
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,286
and did that to us?

286
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,625
The jirashi did say
that the princess came to the festival.

287
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,172
Why can you not trust me?

288
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,925
I am telling you the truth.
She is staying at our house.

289
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,761
What should we do?

290
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:45,640
We bullied her last time at the festival.

291
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,226
Will she remember our faces?

292
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,940
Why is she staying at your house?

293
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,694
She is not feeling well,
so she came to rest.

294
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:03,158
She says she has a lot to learn
from my father and brother.

295
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,212
Sending her away
to Chief Scholar Gyeon's house?

296
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,758
Are you planning
to let things slide like this?

297
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,807
Father.

298
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,355
I have something to tell you.

299
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,610
-Is there something you want?
-No.

300
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,863
There is something I want to destroy.

301
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,574
What?

302
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,704
You...

303
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,958
did so many things for me.

304
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,629
You saved my life too.

305
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,674
I am

306
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,010
really

307
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,305
grateful...

308
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,017
Thank you.

309
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,449
Well...

310
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,868
What are you doing in someone else's room?

311
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,037
Well... That is...

312
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,417
Right, books.

313
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,420
I came to borrow you some books.

314
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,551
Do not mind me
and take care of your business.

315
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,720
Aren't you telling me to mind you?

316
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,430
You are so sensitive.

317
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,454
What?

318
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,377
Well...

319
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,432
It is upside down.

320
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,062
Let me borrow this.

321
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,606
Sure.

322
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,495
Well...

323
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,416
This book will not do.

324
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,841
Then how about...

325
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,428
BOYS OVER THE FLOWERS

326
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,514
This book will do.

327
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,017
It is a novel,
so you will like reading it.

328
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,400
Is there anything you need?

329
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,568
No!

330
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,645
Thank you.

331
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,982
I am really grateful.

332
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:09,195
Your Highness, just hit me
if there is anything I did wrong.

333
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,701
Just kill me instead.

334
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,544
Thank you

335
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,462
so much.

336
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,507
Your Highness,
I have committed a mortal sin.

337
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,219
Good.

338
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,937
Master Gyeon, I will take this book.

339
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,522
Sure.

340
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,530
What...

341
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,925
Is Her Highness inside?

342
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,220
She is inside, but she is very upset.

343
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,556
I think she needs some rest.

344
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,641
I see.

345
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,811
I was thinking of drinking with her
as the moonlight is nice.

346
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,063
I see.

347
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,274
But she promised not to drink--

348
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,693
Just one shot is fine.

349
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,747
The way he looked at me was not usual.

350
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,960
I believed in Councilor Jeong
and went into the Princess' room

351
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,005
and ended up losing his favor.

352
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,673
Please calm down, Your Highness.

353
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,675
Do you think I can calm down now?

354
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,719
The King even covered
for her running away.

355
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,181
I just made him upset for no reason.

356
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,810
Your Highness.

357
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,980
Call the shaman.

358
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,858
-Now!
-Yes, Your Highness.

359
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,791
Trap?

360
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,130
It was someone's plan to make
the Princess come out of the palace.

361
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,716
Will it be them?

362
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,014
I do not know how they moved the Princess.

363
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,184
What was so important
that she disobeyed her father?

364
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,939
I guess it was because of Master Min.

365
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,944
Do you mean Min Yu-hwan?

366
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:58,865
They were very close to each other.

367
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,085
Your Majesty, Second State Councilor Jeong
is here to see you.

368
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,758
Hello.

369
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,094
Councilor Jeong.

370
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,931
What brings you here at this late night?

371
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,601
I came to talk to His Majesty.

372
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,469
I thought you said
you would drink only one shot.

373
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,929
You might get drunk at this rate.

374
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,723
You drink to get drunk.

375
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,900
Do you have something to say
by any chance?

376
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,820
Say what?

377
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,698
If you do,
please feel free to say anything.

378
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,038
Master Gyeon.

379
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,804
What is it that you want to say?

380
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,977
Thank you.

381
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,273
-What?
-Never mind if you did not hear it.

382
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,195
I am getting drunk.

383
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,906
I am drunk...

384
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,288
Gosh.

385
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,519
Your Highness.

386
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,444
Why is your face so red?

387
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,823
Did you catch a cold?

388
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,992
It is because I drank.

389
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,036
You may not recognize His Majesty

390
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,788
when you get drunk,
but your face never changes.

391
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,249
Don't talk back to me.

392
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,138
What are you looking at? Stop looking.

393
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,098
Look over there.

394
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,812
What? Why?

395
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,050
Master Gyeon.

396
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,888
Thank you.

397
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,058
Master Gyeon.

398
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,560
Thank you.

399
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,605
Master Gyeon.

400
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,440
Thank you.

401
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,141
What is it that you want to say?

402
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,309
It is about the Princess.

403
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,357
What about her?

404
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,027
My daughter saw the Princess
at the lantern festival.

405
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:53,951
I have already punished her
for the incident.

406
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,537
Just going outside the palace
is not the problem.

407
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,958
She drank with other men and shouted.

408
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,960
She showed immoral behaviors too.

409
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,212
Also, she cursed
at the noble families' children

410
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,089
and even committed violence.

411
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:13,929
What the jirashi said was true.

412
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,390
What do you intend to say?

413
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,185
Send her in

414
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,312
and bring her marriage forward.

415
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,024
That will be the only way to protect her.

416
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,072
Protect the Princess?

417
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,493
The anger and distrust
against the Princess are soaring.

418
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,163
If you continue to cover for her,
people will start blaming you.

419
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,756
I keep thinking back
of what happened ten years ago these days.

420
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,383
I...

421
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,763
truly hope you will not make...

422
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,099
the same mistake again.

423
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,761
The body was harmed badly
due to wild animals.

424
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,515
This is the only remaining...

425
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,772
You...

426
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,110
may leave now.

427
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,717
Now do you realize

428
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,387
who the real owner of this country is?

429
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,591
You do not look so good.

430
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,344
-I think you need more rest--
-Is she all right?

431
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,305
Yes.

432
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,891
That is good.

433
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,936
Will you not see her?

434
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,649
Do not tell her that I was here.

435
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,911
Let us go. Master Doggy.

436
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,592
How are you?

437
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,707
My goodness!

438
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,709
What? Why are you here?

439
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,878
-Yesterday...
-Yesterday what?

440
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,588
What happened yesterday?

441
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,882
I do not remember anything as I was drunk.

442
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,511
I just wondered if you had a good night.

443
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,056
Of course, I did.

444
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,309
I did not have a good night.

445
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,482
Hello, doggy.

446
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,945
-This is Master Doggy.
-Master Doggy?

447
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,947
Master does not suit him right.

448
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,325
It was the gift
from the emperor of the Qing Dynasty.

449
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,244
Please be polite.

450
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,745
But it is still a dog.

451
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,624
Master Doggy is not just a dog.

452
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,882
Let me explain in detail.

453
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,304
It was given a royal title
right after it was born.

454
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,974
It was served by 4,000 eunuchs

455
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,394
and it enjoys eating
a stormy petrel and shark's fin.

456
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,021
It read The Analects of Confucius
and The Chinese Classics too.

457
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,940
So far, it is the best dog ever.

458
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,406
Really?

459
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,748
Master Doggy, my apologies
for not recognizing you.

460
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,418
Did you expect me to be like this?

461
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,838
It read what? What a load of crap.

462
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,513
All right, Master Puppy.
Shall we go for a walk?

463
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,557
It is Master Doggy.

464
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,891
All right, Master Doggy.

465
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,893
Did you call me Master Doggy?

466
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,646
Oh, sorry. I got confused.

467
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,444
-Master Doggy.
-Gosh.

468
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,408
It is my friend's house.

469
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,410
He will recognize us when we go in.

470
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,329
-Get lost.
-Hey!

471
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,955
-I am Jang Se-ho!
-I am his friend.

472
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,707
Gyeon U!

473
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,960
What are you doing here?

474
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,004
My friend. Look!

475
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,589
We are friends.

476
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,550
-Why are you here in this morning?
-We came to see the Princess.

477
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,595
My life's dream is to see the Princess.

478
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,057
But you did not invite us,
so we came ourselves.

479
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,809
-Let us go in.
-Where is she?

480
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,144
Go back.

481
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,563
-The Princess is...
-Hey.

482
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,357
Hey, Lady Hyemyeong!

483
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,858
Lady Hyemyeong!

484
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,865
It has been a while.

485
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:17,746
But why are you here in his house?

486
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,377
Tell us what is going on!

487
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,797
Do not be mistaken. It is not like that.

488
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,006
Your Highness!

489
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,054
Your Highness!

490
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,058
"Your Highness"?

491
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,143
"Your Highness?

492
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,895
Your Highness"?

493
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,107
She is the Princess?

494
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,819
Just call me Lady Hyemyeong.

495
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,660
What is...

496
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,843
My goodness.

497
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,595
I haven't seen that in a while.

498
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,640
You enjoyed using that bag last year.

499
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,269
You used it so often that I thought
you got it from the Royal Family.

500
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:31,194
This looks so pretty.

501
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,780
Right. The craftsman
from the Qing Dynasty--

502
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,825
It would be perfect for grocery shopping.

503
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
I bought one of it for my servant.

504
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,252
Where did you buy it?

505
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,881
I guess it was made a long time ago.

506
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,216
Right.

507
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,844
They say it belonged to a queen of Goryeo.

508
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,847
Vintage is trendy, you know.

509
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,808
This rare item was quite expensive.

510
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:08,148
But my son cares a lot
for his mother, you know.

511
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,612
The Princess must have

512
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,323
liked his gentle personality as well.

513
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,616
What do you mean?

514
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,994
There are rumors your son will soon become
the King's son-in-law.

515
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,747
Was that why
the King sent her to your house?

516
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,208
Congratulations.

517
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,796
You cannot believe in those fake rumors.

518
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,674
A young man and woman
are staying in the same house.

519
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,718
They must grow to like each other.

520
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,678
I said it is not true!

521
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,180
Shut your mouth.

522
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,894
Be careful what you say.

523
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,670
Here.

524
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,340
No, thanks. I might gain weight.

525
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,259
Never mind then.

526
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,721
Shall I have just a bite?

527
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,265
This will not make you fat.

528
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:29,062
Sure. I skip dinners these days,
so it will not be a problem.

529
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,873
You are going to empty
our food storage at this rate.

530
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,378
I did not eat them all.

531
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,297
Where is the Princess?

532
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,924
She went out with Master Gyeon.

533
00:52:58,758 --> 00:52:59,843
With my son?

534
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,304
Where to?

535
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,599
Go and find them!

536
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,726
Stop eating those sweet potatoes!

537
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,811
I am going crazy here.

538
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,105
My goodness!

539
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,984
-Find them!
-I did not eat them!

540
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,320
My Love from the Star

541
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,405
is here.

542
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,326
Boys over the Flowers is here.

543
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,788
Descendants of the Sun is here.

544
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,123
Welcome.

545
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,417
50 SHADES OF THE YOUNG LADY

546
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,338
It will be one yang.

547
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,215
-What?
-Your late fee.

548
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,302
Why are you returning this now?

549
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,428
Gosh!

550
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,097
It has not even been that long.
Why are you taking the late fee?

551
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,849
It is not my concern.

552
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:51,269
It is one of our newest books.

553
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:03,657
Is the handsome writer in the room?

554
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,325
The handsome writer?

555
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,702
Whom are you talking about?

556
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,872
Writer Jang.

557
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,958
Oh, Master Se-ho?

558
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,250
Se-ho?

559
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,336
He is handsome?

560
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,338
Come this way.

561
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,757
You are here, masters.

562
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,094
-Here is our...
-It is

563
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,762
our workroom.

564
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,098
By the way,

565
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,393
who is this beautiful woman?

566
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:34,104
She looks very familiar.

567
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,147
She is the...

568
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,821
She is Lady Hyemyeong whom I looked for.

569
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,114
I see!

570
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,368
Like I heard, you look beautiful.

571
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,912
-I would like to draw--
-Excuse me.

572
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,498
-Please make us ssanghwa tea.
-Okay.

573
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,501
Put an egg yolk in it, okay?

574
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,546
All right, please come in.

575
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,047
Here.

576
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,767
Master Gyeon was with the Princess?

577
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,853
She was pretending to be ill.

578
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,730
She was not sick at all.

579
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,942
She was having fun with Master Gyeon.

580
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,539
Here is a small gift in return.

581
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,919
It is beautiful.

582
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,310
My lady, please forget about him.

583
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,982
There are rumors that he will be
the Princess' husband soon.

584
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,861
Her husband? Who says?

585
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:10,075
I always got what I wanted.

586
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,591
50 SHADES OF THE YOUNG LADY

587
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,402
You are amazing.

588
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,115
What is your secret
to writing so many books?

589
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,536
I get inspiration
when I look at beautiful women.

590
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,082
And tonight, I might be able to finish
a book thanks to you, Your Highness.

591
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,085
Your Highness.

592
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,384
SECRETS OF
THE FEMALE TRANSVESTITE OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

593
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,262
THE PRINCESS' PRIVATE LIFE

594
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,185
What is this?

595
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,439
"The Princess' Private Life"?

596
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,234
I never had you in mind
when I wrote that book.

597
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:30,029
It is just a novel.
Please do not take it the wrong way.

598
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,489
It is all right.

599
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,033
-No!
-No!

600
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,994
Please... No...

601
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,413
I said it is all right.

602
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,124
I am not that narrow-minded.

603
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,674
You may not be all right if you read it.

604
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,135
What is the matter?
It is making me curious.

605
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,263
It is not fun to read at all.

606
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,265
It is a piece of garbage.

607
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,144
Gwang-su wrote it. Please kill him.

608
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,146
Gosh.

609
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,899
I cannot sleep
when I am curious about something.

610
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,235
It might be harder to fall asleep
if you read it.

611
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,029
You must have read it.

612
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,157
No way. I do not read things like that.

613
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,202
You did. That must be why
you are being like this.

614
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,001
What is the matter?

615
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,662
Master Min!

616
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,164
No.

617
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,145
Are you saying
you could not change His Majesty's mind?

618
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,232
It is not over yet.
It is just the beginning.

619
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,110
I do not know
why they are after Master Min.

620
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,988
Eliminate both the Princess
and Master Min.

621
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,614
I cannot put Master Min in danger.

622
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,032
It may be another trap.

623
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,993
I do not care
even if it is a trap, so let go!

624
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:43,288
The Qing Dynasty has suggested
a royal marriage with the Princess.

625
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,707
-The Princess has disappeared.
-What?

626
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,167
Let me go, Master Gyeon.

627
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,335
Please.

628
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,840
