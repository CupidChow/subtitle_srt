1
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,727
You...

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,605
Do you recognize me?

3
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,107
Prince Eunseong.

4
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,657
Ghost Mask is the younger
brother of Prince Chuseong.

5
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,119
I thought you died ten years ago.

6
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,580
You survived like a rat.

7
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,124
You are the rat, not me.

8
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,794
That was quite a scene

9
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,880
when you ran away,
framing an innocent person.

10
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,100
It was nice meeting you in a while.

11
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,230
Goodbye.

12
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,323
What are you waiting for?

13
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,951
Kill everyone!

14
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,907
Drop your sword if you wish to live.

15
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,242
Do you...

16
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,662
Do you really think you can kill me?

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,331
Move aside.

18
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,958
I will kill

19
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,003
anyone who blocks my way.

20
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,424
I said to step aside!

21
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,761
Is that why you killed them?

22
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,893
Whom are you talking about?

23
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,811
Prince Chuseong?

24
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,983
Min Yu-hwan? The Queen?

25
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,199
Yes, I killed them. I killed them all.

26
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,993
So what are you going to do?

27
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,830
Even the King himself cannot stop me!

28
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,791
Says who?

29
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,959
What?

30
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,185
How...

31
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,062
Stop.

32
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,244
Drop your sword, Jeong Gi-jun.

33
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,957
It is over, Councilor Jeong.

34
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,544
-I said to drop it.
-Stop now.

35
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,046
Stop what?

36
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,133
What did I do so wrong?

37
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,261
I did it for the sake of this country.

38
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,722
To protect this country

39
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,935
which my father's father's father built
with great effort.

40
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,478
To set it this nation,

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,231
which you are ruining by

42
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,943
trying to care for
those ignorant peasants, right.

43
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,154
I sacrificed myself

44
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,407
and volunteered to be the evil.

45
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,369
Did you say those ignorant peasants?

46
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,748
They make up this country.

47
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,834
Not me nor you.
They make up Joseon Dynasty.

48
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,129
Everyone here makes up Joseon.

49
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,924
Sure.

50
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,012
This is why we can never

51
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,140
be on the same side.

52
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,566
Your Highness.

53
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,490
-Move.
-Let go.

54
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,033
Lieutenant Gang.

55
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,085
-Move.
-Let go.

56
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,341
Are you okay?

57
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,554
What happened?

58
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,599
Councilor Jeong confessed
everything and died.

59
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,270
It is all thanks to Master Gyeon.

60
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,064
Master Gyeon?

61
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,653
What do you mean you will be a bait?

62
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,490
I will wear a Ghost Mask
and make him confess.

63
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,326
-It is too dangerous.
-That is why I am volunteering.

64
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,957
I want to pay for

65
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,127
what I did to the King and the Princess.

66
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,047
I want to clear my father
and friends' names.

67
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,676
If it were not for him,

68
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,554
we would have been fooled
by Councilor Jeong's tricks again.

69
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,974
Where is he now?

70
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,104
He's probably with the King.

71
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,501
You are more handsome than him.

72
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,422
You are beautiful.

73
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,119
Jeong Gi-jun,
Park Sun-jae, and Hwang Gu-sun

74
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,622
slandered Prince Chuseong and Lady Han.

75
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,584
They made the jirashis to
denounce the Royal Family

76
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,544
and faked the voice of the subjects.

77
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,338
They committed countless evil deeds.

78
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,717
Thus, the sinners will be
deprived from their positions

79
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
and put to death.

80
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,622
Also, all their family members
will be demoted

81
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,416
from their status to slaves.

82
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,460
They will also be deprived

83
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,296
and be exiled to a remote area
far away from the capital.

84
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,725
The weather is so nice.

85
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,394
Hey, I am back!

86
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,730
-Hello.
-Look.

87
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,691
Look. What do you think
about this drawing?

88
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,486
It looks beautiful.

89
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,531
It is such a nice day for a new start.

90
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,826
Those who needed to leave left, and
those who needed to stay stayed.

91
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,579
-You went through a lot.
-You too.

92
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,831
Let us display the books.

93
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,209
We need to sort them out in colors.

94
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,212
-This one is famous, so...
-Se-ho.

95
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,884
Se-ho.

96
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,182
Mal-geum.

97
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,477
Goodness.

98
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,233
Mal-geum. I missed you so much.

99
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,612
You smell so nice.

100
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,952
How are you feeling?

101
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,662
I feel much better now.

102
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,957
Thank you.

103
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,793
Thank you for being alive.

104
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,670
Thank you

105
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,841
for helping us punish Jeong Gi-jun.

106
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,429
I thank you for everything...

107
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,723
and I am sorry.

108
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,352
It was something that I had to do.

109
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,440
I will discuss you and
your brother's reinstatement soon.

110
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,275
Thank you, your majesty.

111
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,943
Now,

112
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,363
my brother will finally be in peace.

113
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,412
You want me to go volunteer?

114
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,540
You have not visited there for a while.

115
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,959
It is your promise with the
subjects, so you should keep it.

116
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,711
We will accompany you.

117
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,591
Shall we?

118
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,818
What took you so long?

119
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,863
Yeong-sin, come and put these in.

120
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,577
What are you doing?

121
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,322
Mother.

122
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,990
Hyemyeong.

123
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,660
Mother.

124
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,046
Are you...

125
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,925
really my mother?

126
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,969
I am sorry.

127
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,389
I am sorry...

128
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,645
Mother.

129
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,838
It still feels like a dream to me.

130
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,760
Where have you been all these years?

131
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,848
Prince Eunseong helped me.

132
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,561
Your Highness.

133
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,105
Your Highness.

134
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,400
Where are you? Your Highness.

135
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,987
Your Highness.

136
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,364
Your Highness.

137
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,950
Prince Eunseong.

138
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,078
My brother asked me to help you.

139
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,415
Your Highness, you need to hurry.

140
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,484
Let us go back now.

141
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,701
Mother.

142
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,461
Keep this with you.

143
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,135
I will not return to the palace.

144
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,724
I do not belong there.

145
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,145
Why do you say so?

146
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,648
The Prince...

147
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,944
Do you not miss him?

148
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,824
It is too late...

149
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,203
to show myself and
tell him I am his mother.

150
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,211
That will only hurt and confuse him more.

151
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,754
Mother...

152
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,173
What do you mean?

153
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,635
I do not know

154
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,887
what you are saying now.

155
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,849
-Hyemyeong.
-No.

156
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
No, Mother.

157
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,105
Please come with me.

158
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,116
Please take good care of the Prince.

159
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,162
Mother.

160
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,716
The Princess met her mother?

161
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,847
She does not wish to come back.

162
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,896
She must have been hurt a lot.

163
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,274
She is being

164
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,736
considerate for her son.

165
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,227
Your Highness, something bad happened.

166
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,608
The Prince went to central palace.

167
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,005
Prince.

168
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,092
Hyemyeong.

169
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,973
Where is Mother?

170
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,433
Did you not say she was ill?

171
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,852
Did you not say

172
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,188
it was why she could not see me?

173
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,193
Is she staying outside the palace?

174
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,281
Where is Mother? Tell me, Hyemyeong.

175
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,777
I thought about it

176
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,321
over and over last night.

177
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,283
I think

178
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,830
I understand how you feel
at least vaguely.

179
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,085
Thank you.

180
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,172
Can I...

181
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,136
visit you from time to time like this?

182
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,868
He seemed very nice.

183
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,456
Master Gyeon, you know.

184
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,009
-Your Highness.
-Do not call me like that.

185
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,846
The Princess misses you a lot.

186
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,056
She thinks I am dead anyway.

187
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,144
It will be better for her if I stay dead.

188
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,604
It all started from my mistake.

189
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,607
Blame me

190
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,778
and do not forsake the Princess.

191
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,162
He seems to care a lot for you.

192
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,507
I decided not to dwell on the past.

193
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,347
So I hope

194
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,268
you do not suffer
because of the incident anymore.

195
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,870
I will leave for Jeonju.

196
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,126
It will be uncomfortable for
the King and the Princess

197
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,796
if I continue to stay at the capital.

198
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,008
I will order them to prepare
for your move.

199
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,594
I am sorry, Father.

200
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,556
Gyeon U, can I talk to you for a second?

201
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,143
Sure, come in.

202
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,159
Is something the matter?

203
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,078
Are you okay?

204
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,580
What?

205
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,040
I mean,

206
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,251
if you leave for Jeonju,

207
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,005
you might not be able to
see the Princess again.

208
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,882
I wonder if you will be all right.

209
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,677
Cheer up.

210
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,558
It is the dried persimmons
I took from you last time.

211
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,731
Why did you not eat it?

212
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,525
I am okay. You enjoy it.

213
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,486
Eating sweets is best when you feel down.

214
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,657
Thank you.

215
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,493
Cheer up, Gyeon U.

216
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,577
Dried persimmon helps you
fall asleep easily.

217
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,330
Do not forget to eat it
before you go to sleep.

218
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,680
So I hope

219
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,226
you do not suffer
because of the incident anymore.

220
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,001
Master Gyeon.

221
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,010
Lieutenant Gang.

222
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,806
Are you here to see the Princess?

223
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,183
No,

224
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,770
I just came by for one last time.

225
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,733
What do you mean?

226
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,487
I'm leaving for Jeonju tomorrow.

227
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,284
Please take good care of her.

228
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,121
You should see her in person...

229
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,624
How could I dare see her?

230
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,377
It will be too hard for her

231
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,047
to see me.

232
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,799
-Mater Gyeon.
-Please

233
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,344
take good care of her.

234
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,222
I will get going now.

235
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,781
So you are leaving.

236
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,205
Are you not coming back
to the capital at all?

237
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,708
You guys can visit me in Jeonju.

238
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,631
It is just that I feel bad
that we will not be able to see

239
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,925
each other as often as before.

240
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,134
Me too.

241
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,350
Goodness.

242
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,356
Master Gyeon.

243
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,860
Please do not leave.

244
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,158
-Do not go.
-Do not leave.

245
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,468
Master Gyeon.

246
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,264
Thank you.

247
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,560
-What?
-Never mind if you did not hear it.

248
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,277
I am getting drunk. I am drunk...

249
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,907
How could I dare see her?

250
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,786
It will be too hard for her to see me.

251
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,776
Are you inside?

252
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,028
Yes.

253
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,793
It feels strange, right?

254
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,837
Yes.

255
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,631
I did not know my room was so big.

256
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,983
What is the matter, Lieutenant Gang?

257
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,903
I have thought long and hard about

258
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
if I should tell you this

259
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,533
or not.

260
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,787
Lieutenant Gang.

261
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,039
When my mother passed away,

262
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,626
you said this to me.

263
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,006
You need to keep smiling for
happy occasions to come.

264
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,553
I want to bring you back your smile.

265
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,680
But

266
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,808
I don't think...

267
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,061
it is something I can do.

268
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,778
Master Gyeon is leaving for Jeonju today.

269
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,796
Get off already!

270
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,757
-Stop it!
-Get off!

271
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,029
You are a slow runner.

272
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,115
Do you think this is funny?

273
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,766
Let go!

274
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,852
Let me go!

275
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,275
Now, explain to me.

276
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,779
Can you just pretend that

277
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,866
you haven't seen me just this once?

278
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,119
Just once.

279
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,958
Please, Master Gyeon.

280
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,863
Master Gyeon is leaving for Jeonju today.

281
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,885
I found it on my way here.

282
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,057
Are you here to see me?

283
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,644
I just happened to pass by.

284
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,814
I know you came to see me with flowers.

285
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,794
Why are you staring at me?

286
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,338
Because you are so lovely.

287
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,032
Do not go.

288
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,994
Do not go, Master Gyeon.

289
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,955
Your Highness.

290
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,292
I have not forgiven you yet.

291
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,336
I hate you.

292
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,755
I resent you.

293
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,050
But...

294
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,764
I need you.

295
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,183
I am not happy...

296
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,936
without you.

297
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,708
Stop right there.

298
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,886
Oh, no.

299
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,222
What is going on?

300
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,808
What is wrong?

301
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,292
-Arrest him.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,919
Make way.

303
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,379
You sinner.

304
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,173
He deserves punishment.

305
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,800
-Goodness.
-He deserves it.

306
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,435
What is the matter?

307
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,022
Someone just stole something from me.

308
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,942
Where was he headed?
I shall run after him immediately.

309
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,427
It is you.

310
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:52,306
You stole

311
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,100
my heart

312
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,560
just now.

313
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,361
-You look so beautiful.
-Gosh.

314
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,489
-You look amazing.
-Do not say that.

315
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,493
It is deer antlers.

316
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,121
I thought it would be great for your son.

317
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,084
You did not have to prepare this.

318
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,171
My son is taking the state exam this time.

319
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,135
No, thanks. My son is healthy.

320
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,888
This is the latest edition
imported from Japan.

321
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,016
I bought this for you thinking
it would look great on you.

322
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,354
Oh, dear.

323
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,523
My goodness.

324
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,992
I do not have any other intentions.
Please take it.

325
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,496
I feel uncomfortable whenever
I receive gifts.

326
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,708
If you do not like this, shall
I prepare something else?

327
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,503
It is not a big deal that my son is
becoming the Princess' husband.

328
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,589
Why are you doing this?

329
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,341
It is making me so uncomfortable.

330
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,012
What is wrong with all of you?

331
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,432
If he becomes her husband,
he can never be an official.

332
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,020
You are right.

333
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,105
They say

334
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,526
the Princess has the
most influence in Joseon.

335
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,652
They say

336
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,323
the Prince cares dearly for his sister.

337
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:36,577
But it is not like she would grant
a position if I ask.

338
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,705
She is not someone who would do that.

339
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,709
I hope you are not mistaken
from what I said earlier.

340
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,922
I never thought
the Princess' husband is nothing.

341
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,050
It is nothing indeed.
He will be only her husband.

342
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,510
He cannot become an official.

343
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,094
My gosh.

344
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,223
When will the wedding be by the way?

345
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,229
I guess it will be soon.

346
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,940
"The ruler must act like a ruler.

347
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,608
The child must act like a child."

348
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,109
"The ruler must act like a ruler.

349
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,402
The child must act like a child."

350
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:15,366
This is the teaching of Confucius
in ruling over a country.

351
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,036
I hope you become a right king

352
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,663
and lead a country to be where

353
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,582
the subjects, parents, and children

354
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,626
behave accordingly.

355
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,127
Yes, master.

356
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,675
By the way, are you going somewhere?

357
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,761
You're saying it like
it is your last advice.

358
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,016
Today will be your last lesson from me.

359
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,769
Are you going somewhere far away again?

360
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,274
Will I not be able to see you again?

361
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,526
That is not the case.

362
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,280
We will see each other often.

363
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,122
Do you not smell something burning?

364
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,421
See, my heart is burning.

365
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,257
Will you marry me?

366
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,552
It is so cool.

367
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,554
-It is amazing.
-Right.

368
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,642
Do you want me to propose like that?

369
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,688
No, I do not think that will work.

370
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,524
Then how about this?

371
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,080
If you drink this
it means you will marry me.

372
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,834
Was I not so cool just now?

373
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,713
No?

374
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,342
How about this?

375
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,811
Do I want to marry you?

376
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,648
-Gosh, seriously.
-Why? What?

377
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,817
-Is it really necessary?
-Of course.

378
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,613
You have no idea how women feel.

379
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:21,241
How you put it is the most
important part in a proposal.

380
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,452
You have to choose the right
words to impress her.

381
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,329
He does not know anything.

382
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:29,375
Actually, how you put it
does not really matter.

383
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,463
Even if it is not something cool,

384
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,549
even if it does not make sense,

385
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,594
it is fine as long as it is sincere.

386
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,138
-That is it.
-She is right.

387
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,891
-I guess I was not sincere.
-Mal-geum, good.

388
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,936
That was cool.

389
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,203
Master Gyeon.

390
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,443
I'm not going to walk you

391
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,862
to your residence from now on.

392
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,782
Why? Is something wrong?

393
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,247
-Yes.
-What is it?

394
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,835
I feel so bad

395
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,880
whenever I have to say goodbye like now.

396
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,717
I want to

397
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,303
wake up with you,

398
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,889
eat with you,

399
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,349
and laugh with you.

400
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,480
I want to live with you.

401
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,287
Will you

402
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,956
marry me?

403
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,886
Sorry.

404
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,597
Pardon?

405
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,891
I am sorry,

406
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,521
but I cannot take this right now.

407
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,940
Your Highness.

408
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,615
You want to become a physician?

409
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,995
I have seen a lot of ill subjects
while volunteering.

410
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,624
I wondered how I could help them

411
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,877
and treat their illness.

412
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,965
I came to a conclusion that just
volunteering was not the answer.

413
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,426
I do not intend to stop your dream.

414
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:29,846
-We will get married first--
-I plan to go to Qing.

415
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,853
I heard they have more
various ways to treat patients.

416
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,440
I can learn about the Western
medical practices as well.

417
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,943
Your Highness, there is no need to--

418
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,821
I really want to do this.

419
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,617
You understand, right?

420
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:59,543
I was wondering how
to tell you this anyway.

421
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,336
I feel much better now.

422
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:22,316
Goodness. Stop laughing.

423
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,611
This is so frustrating for me.
Is it that funny?

424
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,572
You proposed and got rejected.

425
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,699
Of course, it is funny.

426
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,708
She never lets us down.

427
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,085
That is so cool of her.

428
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,964
This is driving me crazy.
It is not like I can stop her from going.

429
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,552
If you cannot stop her,

430
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,139
-you should let her go.
-Whose side are you...

431
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,642
Goodness.

432
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,739
Look at those stars.

433
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,825
They look so pretty, right?

434
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,959
Well... Why are you all outside?

435
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,508
We are talking a walk.

436
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,053
At this hour?

437
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,014
How did it go?

438
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,725
What do you mean?

439
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,063
You proposed to her today.

440
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,900
Did it go well? Shall we set the date?

441
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,656
Gosh, no. I did not.

442
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,909
What do you mean you did not?
We saw you buy the rings.

443
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,663
Why? Did she reject your proposal?

444
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,709
Not at all.

445
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,798
You went to propose and came back drunk.

446
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,593
-Gosh, he got dumped.
-That is not it.

447
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,515
Mother, Father,

448
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,601
I am too tired. I will go in first.

449
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,860
No way. That will not be the case.

450
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,113
Is it right to let her go?

451
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,202
It is not right.
What about me if she goes?

452
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,622
Master Doggy.

453
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,208
What should I do?

454
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,093
Do not lay your eyes on others.

455
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:43,809
Master Gyeon.

456
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,941
Promise me that you will
never lay your eyes on others.

457
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,360
What are you saying so randomly?

458
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,321
I am saying

459
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,866
not to lay your eyes
on other guys in Qing.

460
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,624
Focus only on your studies and come back.

461
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,751
I will wait for you.

462
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,006
Thank you very much.

463
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,718
Are you not going to promise me?

464
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,804
Yes, I promise.

465
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:25,058
How can I like another guy when
my boyfriend is so handsome?

466
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,068
You will go to the Qing to study
medical techniques?

467
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,362
I wish to help sick subjects.

468
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,239
I understand your point,

469
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,825
but I cannot send you off
to somewhere far away like Qing.

470
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,036
I will train competent people
to help the subjects instead.

471
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,707
I want to do it, Father.

472
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,834
You cannot do it yourself.

473
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,169
You need to get married soon.

474
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,424
Must I get married and raise children

475
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,926
just because I am a woman?

476
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,680
I do not want to live like that.

477
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,807
Right.

478
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,811
You should not give up on your dream
just because you are a woman.

479
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,858
Mother.

480
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,201
Gosh, it is so heavy.

481
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,710
I have a very picky taste.

482
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,129
I am not sure if the food would suit me.

483
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,383
-What is that smile?
-Nothing.

484
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,888
Can you speak in their language? I cannot.

485
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,768
Did you just swear at me?

486
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,646
It means "Have you eaten?"

487
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,982
I know you made it up since
I do not understand their language.

488
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,318
-No.
-Whatever.

489
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,946
-Gosh, just focus on packing.
-Okay.

490
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,909
What are all these?

491
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,747
This book will help you the most
in learning their language.

492
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,257
This map lists famous restaurants
around the area.

493
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,971
-Restaurants?
-When I studied abroad there,

494
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,430
I enjoyed going to these restaurants.

495
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,474
I marked the location,

496
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,393
so it would be easy for you to find them.

497
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,813
Thank you for your concern.

498
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,982
The most important thing is left.

499
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,917
This... Can I have it?

500
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,294
I have mine as well.

501
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,257
I took the original drawing
and made a copy.

502
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,804
Look at it whenever you miss me.

503
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,864
Make it obvious that you are taken.

504
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,829
Be healthy and safe.

505
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,975
ONE YEAR LATER

506
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,902
There are many interesting
treatments here.

507
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,238
They also have unfamiliar medicinal
herbs that do not exist in Joseon.

508
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,575
I plan to talk to Father
and import some of them.

509
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,413
There are many guys who like me
thanks to my beautiful looks.

510
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:19,334
But I am focusing only on my
studies, so do not worry.

511
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,588
Oh, right. There is also sad news.

512
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,300
I gained weight recently

513
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,011
because the dumpling restaurant
you recommended is so delicious.

514
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,222
So Yeong-sin keeps teasing me.

515
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,516
This is all your fault.

516
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,060
I hope you are doing all right.

517
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,481
I will go back as a great
physician soon. Wait for me.

518
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,025
I miss you.

519
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,946
I miss you too,

520
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,198
Your Highness.

521
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,078
Master Gyeon!

522
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,291
Master Gyeon!

523
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,424
I am hearing things now.

524
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,929
Master Gyeon!

525
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,127
Your Highness.

526
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,103
Master Gyeon.

527
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,481
Let us

528
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,275
get married!

529
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,030
Master Gyeon.

530
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,121
Gosh.

531
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,124
You must have eaten a lot of dumplings.

532
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,376
You became heavy.

533
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,300
We met after a long time,
and is that what you have to say?

534
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,093
You are dead meat. Come over here.

535
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,596
-Gosh, Your Highness.
-Stop right there.

536
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,432
-Goodness, calm down.
-You...

537
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,226
Do not be like this again.

538
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,686
You did not miss me, did you?

539
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,191
I missed you.

540
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,195
What are you waiting for?

541
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,655
Gosh, come on!

542
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,241
Me too.

543
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,788
