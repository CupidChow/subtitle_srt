1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,862
Master Gyeon!

2
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,671
Wake up, Master Gyeon!

3
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,812
Master Gyeon!

4
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,859
Wake up, Master Gyeon!

5
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,779
Master Gyeon!

6
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,210
"Open your heart.

7
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,172
Understand correctly and practice."

8
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,425
I think the conversation becomes
meaningful

9
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,886
only when we understand

10
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,974
the intention of the writer
and practice what we learn.

11
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,270
You are the treasure of Joseon, indeed.

12
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,188
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

13
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,197
You must be very proud

14
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,283
of your clever son.

15
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,368
I am very grateful, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,249
What? Adultery?

17
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,335
Yes. The Queen had an affair
with Prince Chuseong.

18
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,088
Even the father of the baby
she is carrying is Prince Chuseong's.

19
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,339
Unbelievable.

20
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,133
The King does not know about it?

21
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,176
They would certainly hide it from him.

22
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,387
Or they will be beheaded.

23
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,432
Those are groundless rumors...

24
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,767
Groundless rumors

25
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,854
stop at the mouth of wise men.

26
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,106
They are so pathetic.

27
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,162
You are back, Master Gyeon.

28
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,123
I came to buy brushes.

29
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,500
You must be studying really hard.

30
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,502
Your brush does not last even a month.

31
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,964
I must study hard as a noble man.

32
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,263
What is this baby's name?

33
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,224
We have not named him yet.

34
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,979
Would you give him a name?

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,315
Are you asking me?

36
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,526
You are the treasure of Joseon.

37
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,580
GA-ON

38
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,417
Ga-on.

39
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,338
Be a beautiful and warm-hearted person.

40
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,132
Ga-on.

41
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,510
Yun Ga-on.

42
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,098
Yun, are you in?

43
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:48,162
I cannot help loving you, Prince.

44
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:53,042
I am willing to give up
being the Mother of the country.

45
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,462
Mother of the country? Prince?

46
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,452
Please...

47
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,079
let...

48
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,457
Let people know of this.

49
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,546
Run!

50
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,512
Wait. The brush store is...

51
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,348
I know it is on fire. Can't you see that
we are on our way there?

52
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,516
Darn it.

53
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,438
Even the father of the baby she is
carrying is Prince Chuseong.

54
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,650
Unbelievable.
The King does not know about it?

55
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,366
They murdered someone
to cover up their adultery

56
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,285
and set fire to the store
to get rid of the evidence.

57
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,539
I should let people know this.

58
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,541
I should make it public

59
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,585
so that they cannot hurt people anymore.

60
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,047
The blind mother ruins everything.

61
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,383
A foolish mother ruins

62
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,469
the King, the people, and the government.

63
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,431
The mother of nation

64
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,059
is ill-behaved and shameless.

65
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,651
Who should the poor people look up to?

66
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,114
The truth must be disclosed to the world,

67
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,992
and the sinners must be punished.

68
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,042
How obnoxious!

69
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,212
The Queen committed adultery
and abetted murder?

70
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,173
The country is in shambles.

71
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,382
There is more.

72
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,594
She even plotted treason
with Prince Chuseong.

73
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,015
People will gather at Royal Court
to demand the Queen's deposition.

74
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,017
We also should file a petition.

75
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,074
"The blind mother

76
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,245
ruins everything"?

77
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,014
It's not here.

78
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,319
What happened?

79
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,489
Who tampered with my writing?

80
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,140
Please...

81
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,434
let people know of this.

82
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,792
WRITE A LOVE LETTER AS IF THE QUEEN
SENT IT TO PRINCE CHUSEONG

83
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,513
Things have gone wrong.

84
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,392
The Queen is innocent. I have to stop it.

85
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,858
I said head back.

86
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,901
I have to meet my father.

87
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,654
I cannot let anyone in now.

88
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,367
The Queen is dethroned today.

89
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,965
Your Highness.

90
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,593
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness?

91
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,970
Where are you, Your Highness?

92
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,910
Please wait for me, Your Highness.

93
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,456
Do not call me that way.
I am not the Princess.

94
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,958
Do not follow me.

95
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,502
You are on your way
to meet the Queen, right?

96
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,923
Who are you?

97
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,092
Why do you...

98
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,768
I need to meet the Queen too.

99
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,108
I will go and check for you.

100
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,859
Fortunately, it seems like she has
managed to escape.

101
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,406
-Mother.
-Your Highness.

102
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,991
Mother.

103
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,661
-Your Highness.
-Mother.

104
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,830
-Your Highness.
-Mother.

105
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:56,794
-Your Highness.
-Mother.

106
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,505
-Mother.
-Your Highness.

107
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,173
Mother.

108
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,726
Are you okay, Your Highness?

109
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,439
You should go back to the palace.

110
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,110
No. I will not go back
until I find my mother.

111
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,028
You can go back if you want.

112
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,490
Then

113
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,661
-ride on my back.
-No thanks.

114
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,223
You cannot walk anymore.

115
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,061
Please wait here.
I will go find someone to help.

116
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,689
Do not. They will take me
to the palace again.

117
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,775
You are about to fall sick.

118
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,695
I will go see if there is
a place to stay nearby.

119
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,199
I will be right back.

120
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,727
Master Gyeon.

121
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108
Are you okay?

122
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,654
Master Gyeon.

123
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,039
Byeol, will Master Gyeon be okay?

124
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,165
Of course.

125
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,127
Why am I so anxious and nervous?

126
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,254
Gyeon U!

127
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,799
Gyeon U! Where is he?

128
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,134
-Where is he?
-Please calm down.

129
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,887
Where is my Gyeon U?

130
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,980
My dear Gyeon U...

131
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,276
I think the Princess is also inside.

132
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,945
What?

133
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,751
What happened?

134
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,296
Does it hurt?

135
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,969
Master Gyeon.

136
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,140
Gyeon U.

137
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,726
-Gyeon U.
-You are here, Gyeon U.

138
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,066
Are you okay?

139
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,862
Why are you here, Your Highness?

140
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,743
It is too late.
Please head back to the palace.

141
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,125
What did the physician say?

142
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,177
I heard that Wol-myeong is captured.

143
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,138
Wol-myeong is captured?

144
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,059
Your Highness.

145
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,978
Mother, who is Wol-myeong?

146
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,898
It is nothing.

147
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,275
Prince, keep reading the book.

148
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,960
It has been a long time.

149
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,379
What is your name?

150
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,135
I guess you decided
to keep your mouth shut.

151
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,306
There is no need to hurry.

152
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,810
We have plenty of time.

153
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,855
Remove him.

154
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,362
Wol-myeong knows too much about us.

155
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,782
Before they tighten the security--

156
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,200
Be cautious.

157
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,411
It might

158
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,873
put yourself in danger too.

159
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,168
Then what is your plan?

160
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,761
If necessary,

161
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,432
we will use someone else's sword.

162
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,769
"Someone else's sword"?

163
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,321
I thought

164
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,201
I would be able to meet Mother this time.

165
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,289
I will clear her name.

166
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,083
And

167
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,461
those who framed my mother

168
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,632
will pay the price for
what they have done.

169
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,393
It was all my fault.

170
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,412
How rude.

171
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,373
The Princess is here.
Why do they not open the gate?

172
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,376
I cannot stand it.

173
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,464
Hey! Open the door!

174
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,342
-Hello!
-Yeong-sin.

175
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,264
Hey! Open it! Hey--

176
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,142
Who is making a ruckus?

177
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,277
What brings you here, Your Highness?

178
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,946
I came to look in on Master Gyeon.

179
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,574
You just met him yesterday.

180
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,164
I got medicine from the Royal Infirmary.

181
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,630
Your Highness.

182
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,507
Yes, Mother.

183
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,635
Please do not get close
to Gyeon U anymore.

184
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,224
I am begging you.

185
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,192
Close the door.

186
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,509
Lady Hyemyeong.

187
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,226
Are you on your way to Gyeon U?

188
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,644
Pardon?

189
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,230
You already got the medicine.

190
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,357
You really care about him.

191
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:27,114
We are also on our way to visit him.
Please join us.

192
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,955
The Princess did?

193
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,291
We asked her to join us,
but she refused and asked us

194
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,293
to bring this to you.

195
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,049
Did you have a fight?

196
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,345
The Princess looked sad too.

197
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,393
Love cannot always be happy.

198
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,272
It contains both sorrow and joy.

199
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,107
How amazing.

200
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,526
You sound like a love expert.

201
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,652
Maeng Gwang-su,

202
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,947
that is not what matters here.

203
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,326
What matters the most is to love
someone sincerely.

204
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:16,329
What do you think, Gyeon U?

205
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,219
Please do not get close
to Gyeon U anymore.

206
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,142
Hello!

207
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,478
Hello.

208
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,693
Are you still on bad terms
with your lover?

209
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,153
No.

210
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,782
Then why are you so depressed?

211
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,457
Are you sick?

212
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,084
No.

213
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,587
Then

214
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,340
is your lover sick?

215
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,389
Is it really bad?

216
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,477
I do not know well.

217
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,892
Do you remember why you went there?

218
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,607
What should we do?

219
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,277
He does not remember
anything that happened this year.

220
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,155
I want you to stay

221
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,949
in your grandfather's house
in Jeonju until you get better.

222
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,446
Are you in, Gyeon U?

223
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,417
I asked the King to approve
our resignation requests.

224
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,755
Let us go to Jeonju together.

225
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,924
Please.

226
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,930
Father.

227
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,353
Have you heard of
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

228
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,358
Do you know

229
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,029
that it was me who wrote it then?

230
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,241
-Gyeon U...
-Is that why...

231
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,953
you told me not to get along
with the Princess?

232
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,915
Did your memory return?

233
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,511
Among the posters around the market,

234
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,473
that is the only hand-written one.

235
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,683
THE BLIND MOTHER RUINS EVERYTHING

236
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,356
Do you recognize it?

237
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,870
How could I

238
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,500
not recognize your handwriting
as your father?

239
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,754
I wanted to know

240
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,548
what really happened more than anyone.

241
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
But,

242
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,430
you lost your memory,

243
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,975
so I had no choice but
to put the past behind.

244
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,728
I could not

245
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,856
ruin my own son's life.

246
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,487
Still, you cannot be with the Princess.

247
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,657
That can never be allowed.

248
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,709
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

249
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,179
What brings you all the way here?

250
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,558
Wol-myeong has been arrested.

251
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,727
Is that true?

252
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,980
You seem very calm.

253
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,440
Then how should I be?

254
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,026
There is nothing I can do about it.

255
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,653
You told me

256
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,573
to just stay quiet and wait.

257
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,953
I need your help.

258
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,789
My help?

259
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,208
Da-yeon.

260
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,171
I heard that Master Gyeon is not well.

261
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,929
-I brought red ginseng.
-Gosh.

262
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,100
How kind of you.

263
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,187
I heard that you did not feel
well recently.

264
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,024
The Princess made you upset, right?

265
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,860
Mother, I said it is a secret.

266
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,738
It is all right. It is just between us.

267
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,531
Are you okay now?

268
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,575
Of course, Mother.

269
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,289
Please come in.

270
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,042
Where is he?

271
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,134
Isn't this what the Princess
brought earlier today?

272
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
The Princess came to visit him,

273
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,687
but Mother turned her away.

274
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,068
Do not let it bother you.

275
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,946
The Princess and Gyeon U will never
be together.

276
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,115
What makes you so sure?

277
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,707
This is

278
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,586
strictly between you and me.

279
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,706
Lieutenant Gang.

280
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,331
Are you okay?

281
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,086
Did Councilor Jeong send you here?

282
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,797
I came to see if you are all right.

283
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,426
Please go back.

284
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,345
This is not a place for you to be.

285
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,140
I will let you out by all means.

286
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,101
It is me...

287
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,478
who put you in this situation.

288
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,856
-If it were not for me--
-This is...

289
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,068
what I chose.

290
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,829
I am sorry.

291
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,083
I mean it.

292
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,801
I made it myself, thinking
about the time we had together.

293
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,720
You like bean porridge, right?

294
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,264
Eat it before it goes cold.

295
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,079
You must die...

296
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,959
for me to live.

297
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,339
I will repay...

298
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,012
what I owe you when I go to hell.

299
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,603
Hyemyeong.

300
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,984
Prince.

301
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,528
I have a favor to ask.

302
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,530
A favor?

303
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,327
I heard that Master Gyeon is really ill.

304
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,288
I wrote a letter to cheer him up.

305
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,463
Please give it to Master Gyeon

306
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,174
on your way to the Bureau
of Medical Services tomorrow.

307
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,661
Where have you been? You are not well.

308
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,082
Did you drink?

309
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,209
Yes, I drank a little.

310
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,087
Gyeon U.

311
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,381
I am fine.

312
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,092
I am all right.

313
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,719
Master Gyeon.

314
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,437
Do you feel better?

315
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,605
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,610
Please spare me your time.

317
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,079
It is chrysanthemum tea.
It helps relax your mind and body.

318
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,167
I think you need that more than I do.

319
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,711
I am really okay.

320
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,299
Please drink the tea before it gets cold.

321
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,611
These are dried chrysanthemum.

322
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,655
Please make tea with them
when you need peace of mind.

323
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,663
I brought something for you too.

324
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,046
The Prince is really worried about you.

325
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,809
Master, I hope you feel better soon.

326
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,730
Hyemyeong cannot stop sighing
all day long.

327
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,483
I thought about it,

328
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,319
and it must be because of you.

329
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,446
Please come back.

330
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,699
I also miss you a lot too.

331
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,079
What did he write?

332
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,875
It is a secret between us guys.

333
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,294
Come on.

334
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,312
Come to think of it,
we ran into each other here before.

335
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,734
It is you.

336
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,696
You returned here on your own.

337
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,489
I was wondering where you were.

338
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,492
Why? Are you trying to be a pervert again?

339
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,494
A pervert?

340
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,747
He must be a pervert.

341
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,500
-What? He looks so normal.
-That is gross.

342
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,586
Don't start with me
when you're the one who's done wrong!

343
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,713
I saved you
when you were completely drunk.

344
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:14,341
Stop lying.
When I was drunk and unconscious,

345
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,510
you tried to rape me at a motel.

346
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,096
-What?
-Rape her?

347
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,599
-But he is so handsome.
-What an awful man.

348
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,607
You looked so funny.

349
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:31,734
Did I?

350
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,363
You looked very bewildered.

351
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,721
As both of you are good looking,
the picture will be amazing.

352
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,311
-Please make us two.
-Okay.

353
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,606
We just need one.

354
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,276
Why? Each of us will take one home.

355
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,529
We need only one.

356
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,742
All right. Please look at me.

357
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,394
You look much more handsome
in the painting.

358
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,022
I look less pretty though.

359
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,442
You are right.
You look much more beautiful.

360
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,572
I was just joking around.
I didn't expect you to be all so romantic.

361
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,907
I feel embarrassed.

362
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,334
You asked him to draw just one.
Why are you taking it with you?

363
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,711
Are you not hungry?

364
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,256
Do not change the subject. Give it to me.

365
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,007
But I paid for this.

366
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,844
This is why I asked him to paint two.

367
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,639
Did you decide to listen to me?

368
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,934
I have something to tell you.

369
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,604
It is about Master Gyeon.

370
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,022
Again?

371
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,567
You will like it

372
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,611
this time.

373
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,831
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

374
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,752
"The blind mother ruins everything."

375
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,845
What is going on?

376
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,764
Stop the palanquin.

377
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,606
Get out. Get out of the way.

378
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,696
THE BLIND MOTHER RUINS EVERYTHING

379
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,790
Make copies of it
and post up all around the capital.

380
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,876
Yes, my lord.

381
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,849
So it was Master Gyeon who wrote it?

382
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,649
Gosh.

383
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,152
Do you think I only eat fermented
skate and spicy chicken feet?

384
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,072
But you like them.

385
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,335
Please help yourself.

386
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,879
Okay.

387
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,061
No way. You did not fully recover yet.

388
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,079
What are you doing?

389
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,918
This is for you, Your Highness.

390
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,007
This is for the one
sitting in front of you.

391
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:10,512
And this is to make a toast.

392
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,729
Please do not drink more than
three shots from today.

393
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,152
As the one to make a toast is not well

394
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,696
and worries about me too much,

395
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,157
I will drink just one shot

396
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,076
for the one sitting in front of me.

397
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,229
I can stay with you a little longer.

398
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,194
Your Highness.

399
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,032
Yes?

400
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,453
It is nothing.

401
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,872
That is not funny.

402
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,543
Let us eat sliced raw octopus tomorrow.

403
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,214
I will dip the alive octopus
into sesame oil and put in my mouth.

404
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,591
It's going to be awesome.

405
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,178
But

406
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,639
without drinks.

407
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,951
Have you heard of "The blind mother
ruins everything"?

408
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:01,123
Is that why you told me not to get
along with the Princess?

409
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,796
Father, you have a visitor.

410
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,973
What brings you all the way here?

411
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:22,060
I just came to drink and chat with you.

412
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,606
What is it you want to say?

413
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,655
I have an interesting story from the past.

414
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,867
Someone put up a poster

415
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,162
that said,
"The blind mother ruins everything".

416
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,920
It stated all the shameful deeds
of the Queen,

417
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,505
and scholars and people raised
their voices

418
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,383
and demanded to dethrone her.

419
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,388
So the shameless Queen was
deposed very easily.

420
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,142
Do you

421
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,811
remember that?

422
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,567
Right.

423
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,361
You must remember it.

424
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,242
Since it was your son who wrote it.

425
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,704
What do you want from me?

426
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,956
I suggest you become my in-law.

427
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,628
Let my daughter marry Master Gyeon.

428
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,842
We need to build a pillar

429
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,386
on each end to support a bridge.

430
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,014
Just one pillar

431
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,184
cannot support the bridge.

432
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,153
Chief Scholar Gyeon turned down
the marriage offer

433
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,197
without hesitation.

434
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,199
You no longer have a choice

435
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,994
but to give up on him as you promised me.

436
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,776
I apologize,

437
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,696
Your Highness.

438
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,461
So what is it you want to tell me?

439
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,027
Please read this first.

440
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:32,328
Write a love letter as if the Queen
sent it to Prince Chuseong.

441
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:36,624
Write as if she is head over heels for
Prince Chuseong.

442
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,376
Refer the letter

443
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,296
I enclosed when copying
the Queen's handwriting.

444
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,382
Where...

445
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,636
Where did you get this?

446
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,222
I apologize, Your Majesty.

447
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,224
Everything

448
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,644
started from my negligence.

449
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,402
There is something you must know.

450
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,406
I can hardly trust you though.

451
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,160
Please listen first and decide
whether to trust me or not.

452
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,306
Master Gyeon.

453
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:49,572
Master Gyeon.

454
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,618
I just heard something ridiculous.

455
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,288
What is it?

456
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,291
It just does not make sense,

457
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,586
so I think it is a lie.

458
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,674
I really think it is not true.

459
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,467
Your Highness.

460
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,138
I heard that...

461
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,018
you caused the dethronement of my mother.

462
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,688
It is not true, is it?

463
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,448
I know it is not.

464
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,326
But

465
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,246
can you tell me that
it is not true yourself?

466
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,957
Please say

467
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,544
it is not true and it is a made-up lie.

468
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,143
Why are you silent?

469
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,063
Say it is not true.

470
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,072
Why?

471
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,743
Why are you not saying it is not true?

472
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,627
It cannot be true. It is not, is it?

473
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,046
Say it is not true!

474
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,725
I apologize,

475
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,311
Your Highness.

476
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,158
My apologies.

477
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,398
How could Master Gyeon have
the evidence from ten years ago?

478
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,400
We must tip the scale.

479
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,069
I will never die alone.

480
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,698
Investigation is unavoidable
as the evidence was found.

481
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,785
There must be a sacrifice
to protect something precious.

482
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,413
The truth will be revealed no matter what.

483
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,708
I came to say that I cannot forgive you.

484
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,465
