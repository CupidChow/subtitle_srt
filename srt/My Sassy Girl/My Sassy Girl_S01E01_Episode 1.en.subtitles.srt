1
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:42,292
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.

2
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:48,089
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,261
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.

4
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:00,268
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.
-Your Majesty. Please dethrone the Queen.

5
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,314
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,816
Do not worry, my Queen.

7
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,236
I will protect you.

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,410
Commander Jeong.

9
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,788
Remove those troops immediately.

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,123
The Queen is not pregnant
with the King's baby.

11
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,291
How dare you?

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,961
Are you trying to become a traitor?

13
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,342
The Queen has been in league with
Prince Chuseong for a long time.

14
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,844
Shut your mouth.

15
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,346
I have evidence.

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,816
You must hurry.
You must stop their evil plan.

17
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,028
Your Majesty!

18
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,449
What is this treacherous act?

19
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,743
We are not being treacherous.
We are being loyal, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,912
-Arrest the traitor right away!
-Yes.

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,914
Stand back!

22
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,295
I will not be dragged out by you rebels.

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,382
There are posters like these
posted on the streets.

24
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,474
"The blind mother ruins everything."

25
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,476
The blind Queen ruined

26
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,188
the King, the people and the government.

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,024
That is the will of the people

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,776
and their voices.

29
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,906
This is a conspiracy.

30
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,786
Your Majesty, do not let your
personal feelings get in the way.

31
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,789
Even the Queen Dowager gave us permission.

32
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,274
Are you not afraid of the gods?

33
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,944
Soon, the world will fear me

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,824
more than they fear the gods.

35
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,832
Take her.

36
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,963
Mother.

37
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,134
Mother.

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,224
Mother.

39
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,395
Mother. Do not go.

40
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,066
You must take care of

41
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,320
your father and grandmother

42
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,447
for me.

43
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,075
All right?

44
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,706
-Mother.
-Take her.

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,500
-My baby.
-Mother.

46
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,337
-My baby.
-Mother.

47
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,090
Let go of me.

48
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,175
Let go of me.

49
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,928
My baby.

50
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,429
-Mother.
-My baby.

51
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,555
Let me go!

52
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,892
Mother.

53
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,894
Mother.

54
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,313
Mother.

55
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,570
Mother.

56
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,533
Mother.

57
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,329
Mother.

58
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,375
Mother.

59
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,506
Mother, do not go.

60
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,802
Mother.

61
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,594
-Get them!
-Get them!

62
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,438
Wol-myeong. How could you do this?

63
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,233
Everything is over. Goodbye.

64
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,991
Why did you

65
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,286
give them permission to dethrone her?

66
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,583
Why?

67
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,763
Mother!

68
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,201
Suk-won.

69
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,997
If it weren't for you, I could not
have convinced the Queen Dowager.

70
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,295
You promised that
you will make me the Queen.

71
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,256
I hope you haven't forgotten.

72
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,388
How could I ever be sure that

73
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,101
you will not betray me
even after you become the Queen?

74
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,376
Do you believe me now?

75
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,812
When her palanquin leaves the city,

76
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,398
kill the dethroned queen.

77
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,255
PRINCE CHUSEONG'S RESIDENCE

78
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,633
"There cannot be

79
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,928
two suns under the sky"?

80
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,806
He almost got caught
fornicating with the Queen.

81
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,641
That is why he rebelled against you.

82
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,823
Stop right there.

83
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,706
Your Majesty. It is too dangerous.

84
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,041
Move aside.

85
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,044
There is something I must ask my uncle.

86
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,926
Move aside.

87
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,570
Uncle.

88
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,492
Is everything I have seen and heard true?

89
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,744
Have you been...

90
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,415
-with the Queen--
-Your Majesty.

91
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,459
Is it true

92
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,963
that you tried to take my throne
to cover up your dirty crime?

93
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,756
Has your insight gone dull

94
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,843
because of your wicked subjects?

95
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,809
Tell me.

96
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
Tell me the truth.

97
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,814
Tell me right now.

98
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,107
I have

99
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,818
lost your trust

100
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,113
and could not stop their evil plan.

101
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,490
I will pay for that sin

102
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,034
with my death.

103
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,041
However,

104
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,419
please open up your heart

105
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,508
and listen to the sincerity of the Queen.

106
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,570
He is your son.

107
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,160
The Queen risked her life
to give birth to this baby.

108
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,745
He is

109
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,582
the Royal Line of the Royal Family.

110
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,150
Arrest the rebel.

111
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,760
I will haunt you down

112
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,346
even after my death

113
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,975
to punish you for your sins.

114
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,581
Isn't this pretty?

115
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,125
Our mother made this for us.

116
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,212
Baby, do not cry.

117
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,882
She will be back soon.

118
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,787
Have you made a decision?

119
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,667
Prince Chuseong plotted a rebellion.

120
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,546
Since you all stopped the rebellion,
you will become merit subjects.

121
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,759
What will you do with the child?

122
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,932
I will report to the Great Shrine
and appoint him as the Prince.

123
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,729
Once he grows up, he will
look into the dethroned Queen's--

124
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,481
I will put a gag order.

125
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,857
If anyone dares to discuss

126
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,569
the dethroned Queen for the next
100 years, I will punish them severely.

127
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,696
Your Majesty.

128
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,740
Commander Jeong...

129
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,619
If you try to stop me,

130
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,288
I will fight against you

131
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,125
at the risk of this throne.

132
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,963
I am

133
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,174
just one of your loyal subjects.

134
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,221
I will do as you wish.

135
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:16,035
10 YEARS LATER

136
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,022
Studying three years in the Qing Dynasty
helped me learn who I am

137
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,276
and it helped me learn
what I am capable of.

138
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,293
Power to predict the future
comes from knowing the history.

139
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,296
If you want to know one's future,

140
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,674
you must know about his past

141
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,676
and his history.

142
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,224
This is the only way to find the solution.

143
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,728
You are amazing.

144
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,107
The depth of your studies
in literature is astonishing.

145
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,365
-Great!
-Good work!

146
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,672
-This is mine.
-No, I had it first.

147
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,258
-It is mine.
-No, it's not.

148
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,969
Stop taking it away from her.

149
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,764
-Young noble from Joseon.
-Goodness.

150
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,600
I am going to take it first.

151
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,777
-Wow, he looks amazing.
-I adore you.

152
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,903
Do not go back.

153
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,989
Do not go back to Joseon please.

154
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,802
It saddens me to hear you have to go back.

155
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,390
When drinking with a good friend a
thousand glasses of drinks is not enough.

156
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,060
Cheers.

157
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,688
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

158
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,406
I gave it my best
among excellent scholars.

159
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,577
I always managed to be the best
despite the attention I had.

160
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,331
The Qing Dynasty, me, a success.

161
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,972
With great ambitions, I--

162
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,486
With great ambitions, I am--

163
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,457
With great ambitions, I am

164
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,585
returning to Joseon.

165
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,595
Master Doggy.

166
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,723
This is Joseon.

167
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,642
Gyeon U?

168
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,693
Hey, long time no see.

169
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,612
What? You are in Joseon now.

170
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,283
I knew you would boast about everything.

171
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,830
What is this ugly thing?

172
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,626
Come on. This is a friend of mine
which the Emperor gave me.

173
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,295
Be nice.

174
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,595
Master Doggy, stay here.

175
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,391
Wait, what? I hope this is not my present.

176
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,227
My son.

177
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,357
I have returned safely.

178
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,946
I have been waiting for you to come.

179
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
Let me take a look at you.

180
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,660
Goodness, your time in Yanjing
made you even handsomer.

181
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,662
My looks will never fade away.

182
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,623
You must be tired from the trip.

183
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,250
Let us hurry. His Majesty is waiting.

184
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,088
Why are your hands so rough?

185
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,382
Your Majesty.

186
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,095
Chief Scholar Gyeon Pil-hyeong
and his son at your service.

187
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,061
Do you remember?

188
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,564
When you were ten, you read
Conversations of Master Chu

189
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,400
and shocked me and my subjects.

190
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,403
You have named me the treasure of Joseon.

191
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,072
How could I forget?

192
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,076
I heard the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty
insisted on you staying,

193
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,994
yet you still left. Is that true?

194
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,621
I still lack knowledge

195
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,291
but I wanted to make use of it
for Your Majesty and your people.

196
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,674
Chief Scholar Gyeon,
you have such an excellent son.

197
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,552
I am ever grateful, Your Majesty.

198
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,770
What should I do now?

199
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,439
I cannot waste away our treasure.

200
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,651
No matter what my position is,
I will do my best.

201
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,158
I heard it has been three years
since you have been gone.

202
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,035
I will reward you with a royal coffer.

203
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,579
Until I call you back,

204
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,541
enjoy your motherland and
take a rest from your journey.

205
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,043
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

206
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,427
You have learned something so awesome.

207
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,179
This is pretty cool.

208
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,972
You can each take a cup.

209
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,557
My goodness.

210
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,149
"Do" means dishes, "mi" means falling,
and "no" means waves.

211
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,651
They fall down like a wave,

212
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,570
so it is called a domino cocktail.

213
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,657
This is the hottest way of
mixing liquor in Yanjing now.

214
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,035
It sounds like
you have not studied at all.

215
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,162
Did you just drink
and sleep with the ladies there?

216
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,246
Come on.

217
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,124
Nerds who are always reading their books

218
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,709
cannot become a worthy man.

219
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,296
I partied from time to time
and sometimes gambled.

220
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,590
I caught two birds with one stone.

221
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,468
People say heroes love the ladies.

222
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,971
Please keep us in your mind.

223
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,723
His Majesty has his eyes on you.

224
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,142
You are on a road to success.

225
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,394
Every tide has its ebb.

226
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,481
Power may look grand

227
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,525
but it is all vanity
like a fistful of flower petals

228
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,402
blown away with the wind.

229
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,154
Stop whining.

230
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,576
All right. This is on the King,
so enjoy yourselves.

231
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,411
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

232
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,376
Gyeon U?

233
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,889
It has been a while.
When did you get back?

234
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,144
The entire nation of Joseon knows.
But I guess you did not.

235
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,191
Right, have a glass.
This is from His Majesty.

236
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,193
Let's just say I did.

237
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,736
Come on.

238
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:16,449
Chang-hwi is now in a position
where he shouldn't take

239
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,159
a glass from just anyone.

240
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,495
I guess the news
did not reach the Qing Dynasty.

241
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,415
He got a job at
the Ministry of Supervision.

242
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,084
I knew it.

243
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,588
Your father prepared
a position just for you.

244
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,720
I heard you did not pass the exam
even after hiring a scholar...

245
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,222
and a teacher to teach you.

246
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,266
Twice, was it?

247
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,610
Sure, the King has his eyes on you.

248
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,404
You must be holding your head up high.

249
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,906
However, you should be careful.

250
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,452
A nail that sticks out
calls out for a hammer.

251
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,665
The prettier a flower is,
the more envious weeds get.

252
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,626
You do not have to worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

253
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,546
You did not get that job
with your talents.

254
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,423
If you slip and fall,

255
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,301
it would be too sad.

256
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,641
Let us wait and see

257
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,144
who slips and falls first.

258
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,612
He always boasted about
the success he got through connections.

259
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,656
It feels so good
to watch him get humiliated.

260
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,493
Why do they always walk with a swagger?

261
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,746
Now, the uninvited guests are gone.

262
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,956
-Let us get this party started.
-Let us get it started.

263
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,959
Do you know about twister cocktail?

264
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,586
It is the second hottest

265
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,506
cocktail in Yanjing right now.

266
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,841
"Twister cocktail"? What is that?

267
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,810
-Wow.
-How amazing.

268
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,633
Joseon surely changed a lot.

269
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,580
Who is going to Namdaemun?

270
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,915
Anyone for Namdaemun?

271
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,625
Excuse me, my lady.

272
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,086
This way. Have a great journey.

273
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,380
Take her back safely.

274
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,965
Next, anyone for...

275
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,717
-Let us go.
-Leaving.

276
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,011
All right, next up.

277
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,763
Next, Pimatgol.

278
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,682
Anyone going to Pimatgol?

279
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,394
I have been waiting for Namsangol.
Why are you taking others?

280
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,355
Old man, you are unbelievable.
I told you that we do not go there.

281
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:01,651
Not many people come here from Namsangol
so we will have to return empty. Darn it.

282
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,446
-Or give us twice the fare.
-Twice?

283
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,575
How can you do this?

284
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,076
Move. Next customer.

285
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,661
Hey.

286
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,502
You asshole.

287
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,630
Hey, are you okay?

288
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,215
You.

289
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,093
Where are your manners for the elderly?

290
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,430
How dare you try to rip-off and
refuse to take that old man?

291
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,558
Why do you care if I refuse
to take him or rip him off?

292
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,647
You think it's good manners for
a lady to beat people up while drunk?

293
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
You little...

294
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,694
Not a chance.

295
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,863
I will find a way.

296
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,782
-Are you okay?
-Hey.

297
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,743
What are you doing? Get her.

298
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,037
Get her. Get her!

299
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,790
Let go of me. Let go.

300
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,585
If you are drunk,
you should just go home quietly.

301
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,670
You shouldn't stick your nose in
other people's business.

302
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,839
Let go. You assholes!

303
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,382
Do you not want to go home?

304
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,928
Then grab another drink with me.

305
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,055
Let go of her.

306
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,478
Who are you?

307
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,523
Oh, her lover?

308
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,027
Let us just say I am a noble man
who can't tolerate injustice.

309
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,153
Goodness.

310
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,907
Unbelievable.

311
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,533
Mind your own business.

312
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,411
You will get in trouble
for meddling with others' business.

313
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,622
Harassing a woman will get you
ten beatings with the paddle.

314
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,082
Refusal and ripping off passengers

315
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,626
will get you a fine of 30 yang and
business suspension for a month.

316
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,836
Wait, was it two months?

317
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,047
There are many eyewitnesses here.

318
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,175
Should we proceed to the Police Bureau?

319
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,472
Darn it. What an asshole...

320
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,808
Be careful. Both of you.

321
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,644
Hey, move the palanquin. Move it out.

322
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,728
Okay.

323
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,481
Are you all right?

324
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,952
-Oh my goodness.
-Wait.

325
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,955
-Gross.
-Oh, no.

326
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,584
My goodness, that lady is
completely drunk.

327
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,960
Completely.

328
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,838
Why did you get her so drunk?

329
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,174
Please do not misunderstand.

330
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,052
I brought her because I was worried
something might happen to her

331
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,095
since she is drunk.

332
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,475
I will lie her down and come right out.

333
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,603
Yes, of course. That will be ten yang.

334
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,938
SHORT-TERM USE, TWO YANG

335
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,607
OVERNIGHT STAY, FIVE YANG

336
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,109
What are those prices?

337
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,989
Those are the prices for the small rooms.

338
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,284
We only have the big room left.

339
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,537
If you do not want it,
you can go somewhere else.

340
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,206
Where is the room?

341
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,338
The third room on the second floor.

342
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,256
The second floor?

343
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,961
Darn it.

344
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,389
This is disgusting.

345
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,857
Damn it!

346
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,659
I do not believe this.

347
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,740
Damn...

348
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,692
-What do you think you are doing?
-Pardon?

349
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,905
Are you up?

350
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,241
How much did you drink--

351
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,245
What are you doing?

352
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,122
I think there has been a misunderstanding.

353
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,540
There hasn't been a misunderstanding.

354
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,793
Stop hitting me.

355
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,755
Will you hear me out? Wait.

356
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,299
-Wait.
-You crazy pervert.

357
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,385
You jerk.

358
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,180
Will you please stop?

359
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,391
Calm down.

360
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,770
You got drunk and threw up on me. Get it?

361
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,438
You jerk.

362
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,482
Listen.

363
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,443
-Come here.
-Stop, please.

364
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,112
-Come here.
-What?

365
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,239
"I will come right out"?

366
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,907
I knew it.

367
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,159
I have never seen a guy

368
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,162
who came right out
over the 20 years of my business.

369
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,876
Wait, stop.

370
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,339
Calm down and hear me out, please.

371
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,299
Come here.

372
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,925
I said, come here.

373
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,136
Goodness, woman.

374
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,473
You must be insane.

375
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,357
Please. Please stop.

376
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,443
I am under a false accusation.

377
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,245
Hey.

378
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,958
Hey.

379
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,174
That was scary.

380
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,282
My goodness.

381
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,205
Who are you?

382
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,420
What is...

383
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,568
-Where am I?
-Here?

384
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,154
A prison of the office of justice.

385
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,447
A prison?

386
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,409
You look so neat.

387
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,953
-How can you rape someone?
-Are you talking to me?

388
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,246
My goodness.

389
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,500
No matter how noble or low,
this is the problem with sinners.

390
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,003
They all say they did nothing wrong
and they are falsely accused.

391
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:08,132
You will come to your senses
after you get beaten with a paddle.

392
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,010
Unbelievable.

393
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,140
An attempted rapist
or a blackmailing con man,

394
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,558
you are all the same.

395
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,025
These are infamous con artists.

396
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,235
Giving out high-interest loans,
selling stolen goods,

397
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,529
threatening people with self-injury

398
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,324
to bleed people dry of their money.

399
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,034
Come on.

400
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,119
But we are

401
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,456
better than an attempted rapist.

402
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,583
Are you calling me a rapist?

403
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,507
What is it?

404
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,345
What are you doing?

405
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,641
The attempted rapist, come out.

406
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,022
They're calling you. The attempted rapist.

407
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,407
How can she call her savior
an attempted rapist?

408
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,743
Where is the woman who reported me?

409
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,120
Bring her immediately.
I must have a talk with her.

410
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,708
Let's not make this any harder.

411
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,545
I said I did not do anything wrong.

412
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:32,174
I haven't done a single thing wrong.

413
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,677
Give me your identity tag.

414
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,182
If you continue to treat me like
a sinner after only listening

415
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,810
to her testimony,
you'll never see my identity tag.

416
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,190
You really do not understand, do you, boy?

417
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,234
"Boy"? Did you call me a "boy"?

418
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,405
Should I call an attempted rapist
mister so-and-so?

419
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,824
You even look like a pretty boy.

420
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,618
Wait,

421
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,830
your face is covered with white powder.

422
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,749
-Did you put makeup on?
-What?

423
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,085
That is Monghon powder.

424
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,838
MONGHON POWDER: A POWDER
THAT MAKES ONE LOSE CONCIOUSNESS

425
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,761
Hanyang is not what it used to be.

426
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,638
There are gold diggers everywhere

427
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,434
who put you to sleep with anesthetic
powder to take all of your belongings.

428
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,689
Just pretend you stepped in some shit
Wash it off and forget about it.

429
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,691
It is not easy to catch them.

430
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,654
A man never gives up
just because something is not easy.

431
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,284
It looks like you are
a man with a bright future.

432
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:43,329
If you rub someone the wrong way,
ill-willed rumors will spread.

433
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,789
You will not get to take up an office.

434
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,876
Your life will be over.

435
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,340
It is probably better for you
to call it an end here.

436
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,217
I will take care of myself.

437
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,679
Oh, sure. Do what you want.

438
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,142
Thank you for your help.
If you tell me your name...

439
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,435
Me?

440
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:11,273
I am the spring wind
that blows away with flowers.

441
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,069
-Lord Chun-pung.
-Lord Chun-pung.

442
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,327
Why did you eat without paying again?

443
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:28,332
I told you to come to Hongruwon
whenever you want a drink.

444
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,000
I was too ashamed.

445
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,211
I felt too sorry to go again.

446
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,089
Come on. Do not say that.

447
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,757
You can just give us a message.

448
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,886
We will fill up the liquor jug
and wait for you to come.

449
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,348
You guys are the best.

450
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,308
Let us go.

451
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,453
Are you returning just now?

452
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,629
Are you going to work?

453
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,758
You must have had fun last night.

454
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,637
He just returned home after three years.

455
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,432
He is still young. He can do that.

456
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:33,272
To do great work,
make sure to avoid any rumors

457
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,566
and be prudent in your ways.

458
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,526
Yes, Father.

459
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,447
He will manage himself.

460
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,491
You will be late. You should go.

461
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,201
Goodbye.

462
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,467
Hey, Ugly, be quiet.

463
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,760
What are you doing?

464
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,310
Did you sleep out
as soon as you came home?

465
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,981
I thought you were a neat-freak.
Why are you in such a mess?

466
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,858
Are you not going to leave?

467
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,446
Anyway, where is my present?

468
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,240
Goodness, you and your presents.

469
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,575
Do you not get tired?

470
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,585
How can you bring
a picture book of yourself

471
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,379
as a present for your family
after being away for three years?

472
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,841
You cannot even get this
with a premium in Qing Dynasty.

473
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,595
You can enjoy reading this picture book.

474
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,556
So where is my real present?

475
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,936
Gosh, I am so tired.

476
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,570
Goodness.

477
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,260
No.

478
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,929
I have to forget about it.

479
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,017
Will you hear me out? Wait.

480
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,853
-Wait.
-You crazy pervert.

481
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,814
You jerk.

482
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,775
How can I forget the humiliation?

483
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,281
Princess. You must wake up now.

484
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,324
Princess!

485
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,542
Why did you drink so much?

486
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,669
Here. Have some honey water.

487
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,512
Even honey water
does not cure my hangover anymore.

488
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,764
Look at how dry your skin is.

489
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,310
Do you know your skin looks
older than the Queen Dowager's?

490
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,395
You little...
Are you asking for a beating?

491
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,702
Right, what happened to that guy?

492
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,163
That guy? Which guy?

493
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,789
The justice office took care of him.

494
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,708
A pervert like him

495
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,461
should be hacked into pieces.

496
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,546
A pervert?

497
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,340
Who dared to violate you?

498
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:50,594
I will gather all of the eunuchs,
hunt him down and cut him apart.

499
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,057
-Why?
-Do you not get it?

500
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,603
Right, people cannot know
that you sneaked out.

501
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,689
What did you say you will do
with the eunuchs? Do what?

502
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,067
You are the one who should behave.
You are my biggest problem.

503
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,746
THE PRINCESS SNEAKS OUT

504
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:20,749
AND DOES WEIRD THINGS EVERY NIGHT

505
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,020
The Princess sneaks out
and does weird things every night.

506
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,022
That is the Princess.

507
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,525
She does that while we work hard.

508
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,653
-Unbelievable.
-Sneaking out?

509
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,081
"The King has closed his ears.

510
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,209
The country is out of money due to
the Royal Family's spending

511
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,880
and the Princess sneaks out
every night doing strange things.

512
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:55,010
But the foolish King ignores everything."

513
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,804
These rumors have gone overboard

514
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,265
and are ruining
the Royal Family's authority.

515
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:04,728
It is right to capture the leader
to punish him for a rebellion.

516
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,190
If we punish someone for spreading rumors,

517
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,944
the people will end up
believing those rumors to be true.

518
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,196
That is correct.

519
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,282
You will only stir up the people.

520
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:21,077
Please be cautious when you deal
with these rumors, Your Majesty.

521
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:25,040
-Please be cautious, Your Majesty.
-Please be cautious, Your Majesty.

522
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,708
Your Majesty.

523
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,629
The rumor about your finances are
not true, so please do not mind it.

524
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,590
And what do you think about

525
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,343
marrying off the Princess
to calm the rumor down?

526
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,181
I believe that is the perfect way
to quiet the absurd rumor.

527
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,726
We are here to discuss those rumors.

528
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,941
What do you think, Your Majesty?

529
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,906
The Princess's marriage is
a serious matter.

530
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,326
It is not to be easily decided.

531
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,288
Let us think about it
and discuss this later.

532
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,844
Second State Councilor does have a point.

533
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,889
The Princess is of age.

534
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,936
She will soon be old enough
to be called an old maid.

535
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:35,110
What about the son of Chief Scholar Gyeon
who came back from the Qing Dynasty?

536
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,778
As the Princess's husband.

537
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,781
I do not think it is right to
take in such a talented man

538
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,076
and leave him only
as the Princess's husband.

539
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,079
What do you think about
the son of Minister of Military Affairs?

540
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,247
My Queen.

541
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,835
Can we discuss this later on?

542
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,880
I apologize.

543
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,230
Prince.

544
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,692
I did not sleep.

545
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,030
Prince.

546
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,742
Don't you want to play?

547
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,706
Hyemyeong.

548
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,374
Wait.

549
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,752
Run.

550
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,420
You are doing so well.

551
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,672
That is it.

552
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,968
Move.

553
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,720
Hey, you.

554
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,890
Go over there.

555
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,772
Here, shoot.

556
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,489
Prince.

557
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,951
Are you okay?

558
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,205
Prince, are you all right?

559
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,874
Call the doctor immediately.

560
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,126
I am fine, Mother.

561
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,170
I just fell, that is all.

562
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,421
Prince.

563
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,176
If you get hurt,
my heart will be torn apart.

564
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,971
How can you be so inconsiderate?

565
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,764
I apologize.

566
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,809
-Take him back to his room.
-Yes, Your Highness.

567
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,812
Let us go, Prince.

568
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,904
Have you interfered with his study again?

569
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:47,742
I believe a boy should
get some time to play outside.

570
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,328
There is a proper time for everything.

571
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,831
He is the Royal Line of this country.

572
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,125
He is not like any boys out there.

573
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:59,254
I understand how dearly you love him.

574
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,090
But if you continue to just dote on him,

575
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,926
how can he become a strong successor?

576
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,471
Are you trying to teach me?

577
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,391
-It is not like that.
-Did you know that

578
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,394
your behavior was discussed
in the Royal Court today?

579
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,525
How can you only cause troubles
to His Majesty as the Princess?

580
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,278
You should be ashamed.

581
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:46,259
Whenever the Queen puts on that
scary face, it scares me to death.

582
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,013
She is usually so gentle and nice,
but she is only mean to you.

583
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,223
-Quiet.
-But I am right.

584
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,392
She only dotes on the Prince and--

585
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,477
You little...

586
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,357
Are you smiling? Come here.

587
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,197
Lieutenant Gang.

588
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,525
Stop acting so cool.

589
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,610
That is your problem, Lieutenant Gang.

590
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,320
You are too serious.

591
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,574
I heard you sneaked out again last night.

592
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,625
Then you two should have a talk.

593
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,554
I think you are mistaken.

594
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,390
I was in my room, quietly--

595
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,850
It has been three years.

596
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,146
It is time to stop.

597
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,666
Lieutenant Gang is
worried about you, that is all.

598
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,878
Think about yesterday. You met a pervert

599
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,130
and Byeol lost you.

600
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,381
This is not right.

601
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,438
Princess, what is wrong?

602
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,326
Where could it be?

603
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,009
Have you two not seen it?

604
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,011
Where did you lose it?

605
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,596
Try to think.

606
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,439
Have you seen this woman?

607
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,401
I do not know. I am not sure.

608
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,530
-Okay.
-All right.

609
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,327
Have you seen this woman?

610
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,412
I am not sure.

611
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,541
I have not seen her.

612
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,420
It is him.

613
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,673
The crazy pervert.

614
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,656
I appoint you as a special teacher

615
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,992
to teach the Prince.

616
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,243
I am Gyeon U.

617
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:41,578
-The crazy...
-The gold...

618
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,121
Don't start with me!

619
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,581
You tried to rape me at a motel.

620
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,249
If you do not find my jade ring,

621
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,168
I will write "rapist" on your face
and send you on an exile.

622
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,628
If I find your jade ring,

623
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,464
will you stop calling me
"the crazy pervert"?

624
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,925
-Is my ring there?
-They are rough.

625
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,677
-Get them.
-Hey.

626
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,095
Run!

627
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,811
