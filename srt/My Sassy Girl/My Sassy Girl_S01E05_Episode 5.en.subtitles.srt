1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,119
Who is there?

2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,913
-Get him!
-Yes, sir!

3
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,751
-Stop!
-Stop there.

4
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,012
Over there!

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,855
-Get him!
-Stop.

6
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,152
Stop there.

7
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,126
-Arrest them all.
-Yes, sir!

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,786
From here is the Gentry Village.

9
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,331
You cannot enter without
the King's orders.

10
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,760
That night,

11
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,097
you took something
that means more than life to me.

12
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,688
Then she must have gotten...

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,108
that jade ring from her lover.

14
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,403
Whatever.

15
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,905
I cannot trust what the jirashi says.

16
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,464
Lieutenant Gang.

17
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,466
What is wrong?

18
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,353
I just left for like a minute.

19
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,897
My apologies.

20
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,953
You are incredible as expected.

21
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,790
You took me out of that prison.

22
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,044
-Did you say anything?
-I told you already.

23
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,213
I told you I do my money's worth.

24
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,799
They hung me upside down

25
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,220
submerged me underwater repeatedly.

26
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,431
But I remained silent.

27
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,935
-Good job.
-Then

28
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,980
call me when you need help next time.

29
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,482
That

30
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,943
will not happen.

31
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,819
Pardon?

32
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,473
Great work.

33
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:37,860
LIEUTENANT GANG, PRINCESS HYEMYEONG
AND DO-CHI ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,331
Do you understand?

35
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,464
Did anyone follow you?

36
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,549
-No, my lady.
-No, my lady.

37
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,812
You must not let others know of this.

38
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,448
Princess Hyemyeong

39
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,203
is in a love triangle with
Lieutenant Gang and some guy?

40
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,580
-Who did this?
-But...

41
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
How did they find out
she went to the festival?

42
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,531
Let me see that.

43
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,544
LIEUTENANT GANG, PRINCESS HYEMYEONG
AND DO-CHI ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

44
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:17,103
I see Princess Hyemyeong
likes various types of men.

45
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,523
She's with Do-chi,
the leader of the loan sharks?

46
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,236
Is this true?

47
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,283
Tell me this instant if
you are hiding anything from me.

48
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,452
My apologies, Your Majesty.

49
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,508
What should we do?

50
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,677
It is all over the palace now.

51
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,054
If His Majesty finds this out...

52
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,557
-Do not make a fuss.
-I am not just saying this.

53
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,976
I am worried.

54
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,565
His Majesty is here.

55
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,075
Why did you go outside?

56
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,538
For what reason?

57
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,336
Why can you not answer?

58
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,256
I cannot tell you.

59
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,011
-What?
-My apologies.

60
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,682
You disobeyed your father's orders.

61
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,185
You deceived the King and broke the rules.

62
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,397
I cannot let you loose anymore.

63
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,618
She's grounded in her residence?

64
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,411
Yes, Your Highness.

65
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,125
Finally, I get to breathe with ease.

66
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,462
Congratulations, Your Highness.

67
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,257
You did a great job.

68
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,467
I did nothing.

69
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,721
It was all your doing.

70
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,016
This day did come at last.

71
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,629
Mother, why do you always
wear the same ring?

72
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,925
Do you see a mandarin duck
engraved on this ring?

73
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,765
They say mandarin ducks love
only one until the end

74
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,393
once they find their mate.

75
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,521
Your father gave this to me

76
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,858
when we got married, saying
we should be like those mandarin ducks.

77
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,194
-Really?
-Yes.

78
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,391
Is this your mother's ring?

79
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,979
She is alive.

80
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,736
Where is she?

81
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,279
I shall bring her.

82
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,284
Please keep this safe with you.

83
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,538
I shall return no matter what.

84
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,382
I will see you here

85
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,551
on the day when the full moon is up.

86
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,706
The Princess's lover, Min Yu-hwan.

87
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,626
I think I have heard of this story before.

88
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,546
He is the Royal Commissioner who
disappeared three years ago.

89
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,134
Were they really in love?

90
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,889
That is what the rumors say.
Only the two will know the truth though.

91
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,978
By the way,

92
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,106
why are you so interested in the Princess?

93
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,108
I am not.

94
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,570
Hey. Decide between Lady Hyemyeong
and the Princess.

95
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,572
Do not be a jerk and stick to one person.

96
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,490
-What do you mean?
-You said so!

97
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,868
You said you keep thinking of
Lady Hyemyeong.

98
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,494
-When did I?
-What?

99
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,040
Let us be honest. The one who kept
appearing. That is Lady Hyemyeong, no?

100
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,666
No she's not!

101
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,470
Are you really not going to eat?

102
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,515
You may be grounded,
but you still have to eat to survive.

103
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,811
I am fine, so do not worry. You may leave.

104
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,527
Please try to eat for our sake,
Your Highness.

105
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,071
I said, leave.

106
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,806
Until when are you going to
keep the Princess in probation?

107
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,728
I'm planning to use this opportunity
to fix her bad habits.

108
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,817
But you do not know
what happened to her exactly.

109
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
She remained silent.

110
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,864
I do not need to know
if it is something that cannot be said.

111
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,533
Your Majesty.

112
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,870
Even if she had a reason to go out,

113
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,125
it is still her fault to leave
the palace without permission.

114
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,254
Grandmother.

115
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,258
Prince. What is the matter?

116
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,302
Grandmother. Father.

117
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,930
Please forgive my sister.

118
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,143
-Go back to where you were.
-Your Majesty.

119
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,853
Father.

120
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,927
Prince. What is the matter?

121
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,014
Master Gyeon. My sister...

122
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,849
What about the Princess?

123
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,245
Master Gyeon.

124
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,255
Is the Princess all right?

125
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,010
She does not even drink water.

126
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,263
I am worried
something might happen to her.

127
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,078
-My lord!
-My lord!

128
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,915
My lord.

129
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,835
Why are you so happy?

130
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,963
Something exciting is happening.

131
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:56,218
The Princess got locked up
because of the jirashis.

132
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,886
The Minister of Government Administration

133
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,265
told us after having drinks.

134
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,268
He looked so happy and satisfied.

135
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,730
They do not seem to behave
according to their status.

136
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,151
They might get in trouble,
talking to strangers here and there.

137
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,694
"Here and there."

138
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,240
But we get to hear exciting
stories thanks to that.

139
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,367
I get to hear those stories
thanks to that.

140
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,753
Did you hear?

141
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,798
The Princess got locked up
in her residence.

142
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,802
It was all because of this jirashi.

143
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,888
What jirashi?

144
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,141
-What is written in there?
-Have you not read it yet?

145
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,066
LIEUTENANT GANG, PRINCESS HYEMYEONG
AND DO-CHI ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

146
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,777
My goodness.

147
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,907
-This is ridiculous.
-What do you mean?

148
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,285
Those jirashis only publishes the truth.

149
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,789
Are you saying this is true?

150
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,793
That must be why the King locked her up.

151
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,099
What brings you here?

152
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,435
I'm assuming you're not here to see me.

153
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,813
Do I have to report to you every time?

154
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,983
This place is the Office of Investigation.

155
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,819
You cannot enter here
just because you want to.

156
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,115
I came here to meet Lieutenant Gang.

157
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,243
Lieutenant Gang?

158
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,913
LIEUTENANT GANG, PRINCESS HYEMYEONG
AND DO-CHI ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

159
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,540
They all knew.

160
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,253
They knew the Princess
went to the festival.

161
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,006
They knew you came to find her.

162
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,550
They are distorting the truth

163
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,345
and defaming the Princess with this.

164
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,516
What happened to Do-chi?

165
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,853
He escaped.

166
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,566
I am sure there is a spy.

167
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,111
Who on earth is behind all this?

168
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,823
It is my job

169
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,367
to find it out.

170
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,462
LIEUTENANT GANG, PRINCESS HYEMYEONG,
DO-CHI IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

171
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,549
Do you know about this jirashi?

172
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,885
What do you want to know?

173
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,556
I think someone behind this
is instigating people.

174
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,017
Also, there is a spy within the palace--

175
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,060
It is none of your business.

176
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,064
Father.

177
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,984
Focus only on teaching the Prince.

178
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,569
How can I teach the Prince

179
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,071
if I am not aware of the current affairs?

180
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,532
Focusing on one thing is difficult as is.

181
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,410
Do not be shaken by the useless rumors.

182
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,487
She does not even drink water.

183
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,656
I am worried
something might happen to her.

184
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,021
What...

185
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,982
What is this stinky smell?

186
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,192
It is skate.

187
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,446
It is fermented skate that you crave
even in your sleep.

188
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,241
It is her favorite.

189
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,710
By the way, did you come
all the way here for this?

190
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,381
I would not come here just for this.

191
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,136
I came to pick up something
I left behind and stopped by here.

192
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:53,306
I see. I will deliver
this to the Princess.

193
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,725
-Go ahead.
-Well, then.

194
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,684
I brought you
your favorite fermented skate.

195
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,104
Master Gyeon came here this late at night

196
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,149
to give you this.

197
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,489
He thought this might
bring up your appetite.

198
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,200
Please have a bite.

199
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,267
Here. Eat it.

200
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,770
Oh, right. About the jade ring...

201
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,155
How is it? Is it not wonderful?

202
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,497
Gosh.

203
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,458
I hope she does not misunderstand.

204
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
Well

205
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,280
It is delicious.

206
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,217
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT GAESUNG TEMPLE
IN GENTRY VILLAGE AT FOUR P.M.

207
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,348
-Are you awake?
-Yes, Mother.

208
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,309
Did you not sleep well?

209
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,144
I did.

210
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,730
Have this medicine and let us go out.

211
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,441
Go where?

212
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,236
We promised to go to the market.

213
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,697
Did you forget?

214
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,201
Of course not.

215
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,248
I am going to wear
a green top and a blue skirt.

216
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,500
-Pardon?
-Let's wear matching outfits.

217
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,336
But be careful not to make it too obvious.

218
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,672
-All right?
-Okay.

219
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,801
Gosh, it is so dusty.

220
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,554
Let us look around here.

221
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,930
-Sure.
-Okay.

222
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,475
Gosh, it is so pretty.

223
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,935
Let me see.

224
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,689
Shall I try?

225
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,822
Honey.

226
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,539
Honey.

227
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,462
Have she eaten anything?

228
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,883
Gyeon U, which one is better?

229
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,387
Son!

230
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,681
Yes?

231
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,850
Were you thinking of a woman or something?

232
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,853
No. Of course not, mother.

233
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,689
Which one is better?

234
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,983
-This one.
-Is that right?

235
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,860
Well...

236
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,488
Then let me try this one.

237
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,787
Those girls are busy looking at your face.

238
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,874
-Hello.
-Hello.

239
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,460
This is my son, Gyeon U.

240
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,003
I will see you later.

241
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,886
Son, how about...

242
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:10,642
How about we go for
a walk to the pavilion?

243
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,824
This smells so nice.

244
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,036
The Princess came to the festival.

245
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,497
She enjoyed the night with several guys.

246
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,082
That is disgusting!

247
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,921
I heard the Princess
is locked up in her room.

248
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,800
Others might hear you.

249
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,927
Everyone knows about it anyway.

250
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,390
Apparently, she is dating
the leader of a rowdy group.

251
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,727
-That is only a rumor.
-Many people saw it.

252
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,021
-Let us stop here.
-Son.

253
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,566
Why are you covering for her by the way?

254
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,819
-It is not...
-Get off already!

255
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,371
Do you have any idea how dangerous
it is to ride a horse while drunk?

256
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,748
You could get killed.

257
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,166
My goodness.

258
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,836
Do not mind whether I get killed or not.

259
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,546
Move aside!

260
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,548
You almost hit this child.

261
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,846
I was in a hurry,
so I was going to let this slide,

262
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,681
but still this is not right.

263
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,601
Gosh, she is so annoying.

264
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,561
Get lost while I am being nice

265
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,647
if you do not wish to get hit.

266
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:43,067
Simply asking won't do.

267
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
Get off.

268
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,989
I said get off.

269
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,699
Get off now!

270
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,028
What are you doing here?

271
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,205
-Excuse me.
-What are you doing?

272
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,001
What is the matter?

273
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,591
He is drunk riding.

274
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,514
Get off right now!

275
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,600
It is because I am busy...

276
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,685
Slow down.

277
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,020
I really did not drink.

278
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,481
-Get off first.
-Goodness.

279
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,066
Most people do it this way.

280
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,945
They do not block him and yell at him.

281
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,947
Be wise and patient.

282
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,704
Okay, all right.

283
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,581
Well... I will get going then.

284
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,252
Follow me.

285
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,922
Let go!

286
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,929
-Now, explain to me.
-What?

287
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,764
I need to know.

288
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,726
Why are you standing here when
you have to be in your residence?

289
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,895
I shall explain to you later.
I am running out of time.

290
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,147
You cannot go.

291
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
Can you just pretend that

292
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,281
you haven't seen me just this once?

293
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,617
Just once.

294
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,165
Please, Master Gyeon.

295
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,084
No.

296
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,004
What is wrong with you?

297
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,756
I am His Majesty's person.

298
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,008
I will not be disloyal any longer.

299
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,012
Okay.

300
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,099
I will tell you everything,
so close your eyes.

301
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,810
What are you trying to pull now?

302
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,189
Do you not want to know why I am out here?

303
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,036
I will take you to the palace.

304
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,997
Let go!

305
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,957
Why are you so reckless?

306
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,751
Do you not realize you could get dethroned

307
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,252
if you get caught this time?

308
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,056
Give it back!

309
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,267
I will wait for you at Gaesung
Temple in Gentry Village at four p.m.

310
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,103
From Min Yu-hwan.

311
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,274
Now, you know why I am here.

312
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,652
Are you satisfied?

313
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,721
The guy's name is Min Yu-hwan.

314
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,684
He went missing three years ago
while doing a secret investigation.

315
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,229
It is because he got caught taking bribes.

316
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,439
He must still be on the wanted list.

317
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,238
Gosh.

318
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,033
He said he would come back soon.
What is taking him so long?

319
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,703
My gosh.

320
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,376
Are you here to drink tea?

321
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,170
Why are you alone?

322
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,381
Did you not say you would have

323
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,050
a wonderful time with your son?

324
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,304
I guess your son already left.

325
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,098
Goodness.

326
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,144
He got an urgent message from the palace.

327
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,147
The Prince called him in.

328
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,816
The Prince?

329
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,986
You do not know how much
he cares for Gyeon U.

330
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:41,073
He cannot stand not seeing
my son even for a day.

331
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,253
What do you mean my brother
left you behind?

332
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,172
Tell me in detail.

333
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:00,092
How could he do this to me?

334
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,970
Gosh, how could he...

335
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,765
Something urgent must have come up.

336
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,767
What urgent matter?

337
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,185
Why are you taking it out on me?

338
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,312
Because I am irritated.

339
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,272
You always get angry and yell at me.

340
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,483
You are acting strange these days.

341
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,905
Gosh, I am so frustrated.

342
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,035
It is frustrating.

343
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,912
It is so hot.

344
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,206
This is driving me crazy.

345
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,377
I will return at night.

346
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,003
Thank you in advance.

347
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,089
You know how I feel, right?

348
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,300
I do not.

349
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,178
I really do not want to know.

350
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,222
This is all your fault.

351
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,432
You should have done your job
properly as her guard.

352
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,434
You sleep too much!

353
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,520
What about you? You eat too much!

354
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,273
What? I eat too much? Watch what you say!

355
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,566
The Queen is here to see the Princess.

356
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,248
I see Your Highness.

357
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,209
I hear the Princess is not eating so well.

358
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,254
That will only harm her health.

359
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,383
I made black sesame rice porridge myself.

360
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,970
I will make sure she eats it.

361
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,556
I shall feed her myself.

362
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,820
The Princess is stopping
you from being pregnant.

363
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,240
Burn this talisman and
feed her with the ashes.

364
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,285
Then you will get pregnant
tonight for certain.

365
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,454
My apologies, Your Highness.

366
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,915
His Majesty has ordered not
to let anyone in.

367
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,043
The King

368
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,088
will not blame me for
worrying about my daughter.

369
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,340
Pretend not to know.

370
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,342
It cannot be done, Your Highness.

371
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,510
How dare you!

372
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,262
Step aside.

373
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,513
I really...

374
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,016
I really cannot let you pass.

375
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,018
Still, you...

376
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,979
Will you learn a lesson
only after a beating?

377
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,106
-Make way.
-My lady.

378
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,108
Are you disobeying the King's orders?

379
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,204
What have you done?

380
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,165
I ordered not to let anyone in!

381
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,958
My apologies, Your Majesty.

382
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,461
I was so concerned for her.

383
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,009
My Queen.

384
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:51,055
Have you forgotten that the Princess
is being punished now?

385
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,557
My daughter is not eating anything.

386
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,143
So how could I just stand and watch?

387
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,270
Whether she eats or not just leave me be.

388
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,149
I have no intention of forgiving her
until she apologizes.

389
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,653
I will keep it in mind.

390
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,127
I made this porridge with heart.

391
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,047
Make sure she eats it. Do you understand?

392
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,091
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,301
-Let us go.
-Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,712
Gosh, it is hot.

395
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,593
-It is good.
-Are you serious?

396
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,304
The Princess is not here anyway.

397
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,431
-So what? Do I throw it away?
-Do you not remember?

398
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,600
She ordered us to give it to her.

399
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,186
What about it?

400
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,064
There may be poison in it.

401
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,245
Byeol.

402
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,247
I think I am going sick.

403
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,750
I feel nauseous all of the sudden.

404
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,254
Let us go.

405
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,381
We should tell this to Lieutenant Gang.

406
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,050
That I ate poison?

407
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,011
No. The fact that
the Princess disappeared.

408
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,554
-Hurry.
-Hey!

409
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,516
Will the poison spread if I move around?

410
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,309
Then just die here alone.

411
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,686
Wait for me!

412
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,245
Your Highness, I am sorry I am too late.

413
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,164
I have so much to talk to you.

414
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,252
I will wait for you at Gaesung
Temple in Gentry Village at four p.m.

415
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,504
From Min Yu-hwan.

416
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:49,191
She risked her life to
come out of the palace

417
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,860
just for her lover.

418
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,870
Gosh, master!

419
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,831
Master!

420
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,585
You should come by more often!

421
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,129
Is the jade ring lady doing well?

422
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,464
Goodness.

423
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,302
You two looked great together.

424
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,640
Did you two fight?

425
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,517
What is going on?

426
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,686
Take this.

427
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,230
CHEONGWOON INN CUPON

428
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,734
Get a stamp on this paper every
time you visit our inn.

429
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,613
You will get one free service
every ten times.

430
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,450
I guess you are mistaken.

431
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,745
I am not someone
who frequently visits inns.

432
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,831
Gosh.

433
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,627
Make up with her and visit us some time.

434
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,712
I will treat you nicely.

435
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,380
Oh, and for you,

436
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:58,427
I will give you another stamp
for the last visit.

437
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,726
Do not forget to visit us.

438
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,656
CHEONGWOON INN CUPON

439
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,344
Gosh.

440
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,765
What does it matter to me whether
she meets her lover or not?

441
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,202
DESENDANTS OF THE SUN

442
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,412
LOVER FROM THE STAR

443
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,414
BOYS OVER THE FLOWERS

444
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,507
I am sure you are not looking for

445
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,387
a sweet and corny love story.

446
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,764
Of course not.

447
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,184
A love story

448
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:33,313
that is so sad and heartbreaking
that you cannot help but cry...

449
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,650
Is there something you are looking for?

450
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,734
I will take a look around.

451
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,820
Sure, sure.

452
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,824
How about this one?

453
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,951
-This is popular--
-Old man.

454
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,871
She wants to take a look around.

455
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,457
That was not nice by the way.

456
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,000
I am not an old man.

457
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,751
I am not even married.

458
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,671
My headache is killing me.

459
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,673
Why do we not just go there?

460
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,550
Why would we go to
the kisaeng's parlors at daytime?

461
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,218
Let us just go for lunch.

462
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,596
I still have this hangover though.

463
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,349
I need to recharge through
beautiful women at times like this.

464
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,852
See. Do you not feel anything?

465
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:12,936
Look.

466
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,272
This is unbelievable.

467
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:19,776
Well, which book should
I recommend you then?

468
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,487
I will take this.

469
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,948
50 SHADES OF THE YOUNG LADY

470
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:29,411
You should have told me earlier
if you like this kind of books.

471
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,955
Come this way.

472
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,665
Are you...

473
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,793
not Lady Da-yeon?

474
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,759
You must be Master Gyeon U's friends.

475
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:01,610
Her name was... What was it?

476
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,487
Go ahead.

477
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,493
Lady Hyemyeong, right?

478
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,621
The lady who said,
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman!"

479
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,916
Is her name Hyemyeong?

480
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,042
Yes.

481
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,796
It is correct if she is the one
who enjoyed the festival with us.

482
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,757
Her personality is very straightforward.

483
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,634
She is pleasant to be with.

484
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,973
Also, she is very beautiful.

485
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,934
Not as much as you though.

486
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,063
By any chance,

487
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,817
do you know whose family she is from?

488
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,945
I am not sure.

489
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,824
Why are you looking for her by the way?

490
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,828
I have debts to pay her back.

491
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,999
I see she owed you money.

492
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,634
Search for girls with the name, Hyemyeong.

493
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,719
Yes, my lady.

494
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,722
Lady Da-yeon.

495
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,147
You become more beautiful
every time I see you.

496
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,817
I guess you are busy these days.

497
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,616
The Office of Investigation
does not work without me.

498
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,743
I suppose so.

499
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,038
Seeing that you completely
forgot about my request.

500
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,751
Oh, well

501
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,086
I am looking into it.

502
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,130
It is all right now.

503
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,008
I do not wish to bother you anymore.

504
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,594
Well, then.

505
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,556
Lady Da-yeon!

506
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,070
You punks.

507
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,576
What happened with finding that girl?

508
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,912
Well... How did it go?

509
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,165
-How did it go?
-I thought Yong-chul...

510
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,417
I wonder what happened.

511
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,004
You little punks!

512
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,673
I will look more into it!

513
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,620
If we report anyone of them,
they will offer a reward.

514
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,664
-That is good.
-It is 100 yang.

515
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,332
MIN YU-HWAN

516
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,752
-Min Yu-hwan...
-Do you need money?

517
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,091
You will get the most amount if
you report Min Yu-hwan among them.

518
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,051
I am not interested.

519
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,303
I think you are.

520
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,516
I am not interested.

521
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,813
The reword is worth two palanquins
even if you report anyone in league.

522
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,815
Are you really not interested?

523
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,031
I thought so. Is it not enticing?

524
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,786
Do they get punished for talking with him?

525
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,586
They will be put to death

526
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,337
even if it was only talking to him.

527
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,633
In other words, you will be dead
once you get caught.

528
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,654
Lieutenant Gang is not in the office
so what should we do?

529
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,698
Are you going out to find her?

530
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,909
Or what? I cannot just sit back and wait.

531
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,037
Well. She said she would
come back at night.

532
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,080
Let us just wait in her residence.

533
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,292
What would you do if she comes back
while you are out?

534
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,714
-Thank you! Here is your drink.
-Thank you.

535
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:35,342
Enjoy your food and ask me
whenever you need something.

536
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:40,180
I know you are right-handed,
so why would you use your left?

537
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,723
Are you hurt?

538
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,975
Do not mind. Just give me new side dishes.

539
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,644
Gosh, okay.

540
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,882
Here. I got you plenty.

541
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,759
-Thank you.
-Visit us again.

542
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,094
THE BUTCHER'S

543
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,201
Master Min.

544
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:23,969
Who are you?

545
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,851
Please come with me, Your Highness.

546
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,818
-Here.
-Here, drink.

547
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,989
-Good girl.
-This is nice.

548
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,868
A fake letter?

549
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,871
Being locked up is not enough.
She needs to be stopped for good.

550
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,998
Well...

551
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:57,877
Would the Princess believe he is
back just by reading that letter?

552
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,382
The longing heart for something.

553
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,053
That is the scariest of all.

554
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,856
Please come with me.

555
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,041
I clearly told you to come with me.

556
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,069
Lieutenant Gang.

557
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,035
Stay away from Her Highness.

558
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,457
Head to the palace first.

559
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,501
I will take care of him.

560
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,258
Trust me.

561
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,216
It is raining.

562
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,968
It is raining! Get me the shades.

563
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,971
It is raining. Hurry!

564
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,017
Why is it raining all of the sudden?

565
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,396
Hurry!

566
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,689
My goodness.

567
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,388
She has not returned to the palace yet.

568
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,682
We must find her before
Lieutenant Gang does.

569
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,475
The Princess is being chased?

570
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,977
I have found their base.

571
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,520
How did he find out?

572
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,565
There are rumors your son will
soon become the King's son-in-law.

573
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,358
Her husband? Who says?

574
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,611
I always got what I wanted.

575
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,530
Is there something you want?

576
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,448
There is something I want to destroy.

577
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,450
The Princess is not in her residence.

578
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,119
She seems to have fallen in a trap.

579
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,162
Protect the Princess?

580
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,498
I do not know what they really want,

581
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,376
but they will try to harm her again.

582
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,795
