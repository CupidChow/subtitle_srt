1
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,658
I appoint you as a special teacher

2
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,785
to teach the Prince.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,081
If I ever come across a woman
who moves my heart,

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,168
I am willing to throw my dreams away
to live just for her.

5
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,711
Do you not want to go home?

6
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,630
Then grab another drink with me.

7
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,007
Let go of her.

8
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,595
Are you all right?

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,030
-What do you think you are doing?
-Pardon?

10
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,784
Will you hear me out? Wait.

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,661
-Wait, wait.
-You crazy pervert.

12
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,915
How can she call her savior
an attempted rapist?

13
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,917
Where is the woman who reported me?

14
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,003
Master Gyeon, this is my sister.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,548
Nice to meet you. I am Princess Hyemyeong.

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,133
-The crazy...
-The gold digger...

17
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,220
Were you shocked that I am a princess?

18
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,971
Let us go and see His Majesty right now.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,849
Have you two not seen it?

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,727
It is him. The crazy pervert.

21
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,270
Don't start with me!

22
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,022
You tried to rape me at a motel.

23
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,607
If you do not find my jade ring,

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,902
I will write "rapist" on your face
and send you on an exile.

25
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,280
What is so special about that ring?

26
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:02,831
If you cannot find my jade ring,
you will be done and over with.

27
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,087
I have heard about your
incredible reputation, Master Gyeon.

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,923
You took a civil service exam in the
Qing Dynasty and got the best score.

29
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,759
You were a great talent who even
gained the Emperor's trust.

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,137
The national treasure of Joseon

31
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,222
almost got stolen by the Qing Dynasty.

32
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,685
But if you fail to prove your value,

33
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,897
all those appraisals will be
good for nothing.

34
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,192
The world acknowledges greatness

35
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,236
even if it does not try to stand out.

36
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,075
Anyway, I hope you take good care of
the Prince.

37
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,661
I will do my best.

38
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,331
I recently heard that Princess Hyemyeong

39
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,334
visits the Prince often these days.

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,964
It seems like she greatly
cares for the Prince.

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,009
Well, I will see you later.

42
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,816
Hey, you crazy pervert.

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,828
Where are your manners?

44
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,705
Then what should I call you?

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,916
Lady-killer? Master Obscene?

46
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,918
Or a player?

47
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,045
I will back down.

48
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,343
What did you and Lieutenant Gang
talk about?

49
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,388
You can go and ask him yourself.

50
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,933
Okay, fine.

51
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:50,188
I will tell Lieutenant Gang
about how a pervert became

52
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,358
the Prince's master and get his help.

53
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,987
I suddenly miss Lieutenant Gang a lot.

54
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,906
Wait.

55
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,331
If I find your jade ring,

56
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:13,002
will you stop calling me "crazy pervert"?

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,756
Of course. I promise.

58
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,883
You promised.

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,151
Wait.

60
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,074
She works for the Prince.

61
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,411
I was in a rush to get a book for him.

62
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,037
But this stupid woman

63
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,331
left her pass behind.

64
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,848
You are one great liar.

65
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,851
I am worried for the Prince's future.

66
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,312
I worry more about your future,
Princess Hyemyeong.

67
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,356
That little...

68
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,698
-Welcome.
-Please enter.

69
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,243
This is a pawnshop run by

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,120
an infamous gang.

71
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,496
Is my ring in there?

72
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,166
That is where smuggled goods from
the Qing Dynasty and Japan end up,

73
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,127
and everything that is
taken illegally from people are

74
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,087
sold and bought.

75
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,506
If someone picked it up and sold it,

76
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,508
it will probably end up here.

77
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,929
These men are tough.

78
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,973
Be careful.

79
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,812
What are you doing? Come on.

80
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,862
Welcome.

81
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,281
-Come on in.
-Please enter.

82
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,783
-Go on in.
-Welcome.

83
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,951
Do you need money for your wedding?

84
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,042
It says right here that you will
pay back with interest until today.

85
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,462
The ledger does not lie.

86
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,925
If you give me another extension,
I will pay you back.

87
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,343
My goodness.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,595
Whether one is an aristocrat
or a commoner,

89
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,555
the ones who are in debt
all have one thing in common.

90
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,349
They never pay their money back on time.

91
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,935
They always ask for an extension.
That is what they do.

92
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,270
-Please spare my life.
-Hey!

93
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,231
You're making me look like a bad guy

94
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,566
because you keep breaking your promise.

95
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,987
Please help me live as a good guy,
will you?

96
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,993
Boss, you have guests.

97
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
My goodness, you are the attempted rapist.

98
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,885
"Attempted rapist"?

99
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,388
You must be quite famous for that.

100
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,809
Would you like to get sued for defamation?

101
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,394
My goodness, how scary.

102
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,857
But what brings you here?

103
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,907
So these were all smuggled,
stolen, taken away,

104
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,452
or conned from people.

105
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,413
You are a funny lady.

106
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,206
You can take your time.

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,835
But each of you must pay me
one yang to take a look.

108
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,837
Why are you charging us for just looking?

109
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,590
This is a business. We must make money.

110
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,467
You may leave if you are not
willing to pay.

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,305
What?

112
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,947
Take a closer look.

113
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,033
I can tell at once.

114
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,001
Ms. Naju, overdue interest of 190 yang.

115
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,004
Overdue interest is 50 yang per day.

116
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,547
-Let us go.
-Wait.

117
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,551
Do you have any golden hairpin too?

118
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,555
You will need to pay two yang
per person to take a look.

119
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,976
My goodness.

120
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,236
Why do you want to...

121
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,161
I am a little busy today. I have to go.

122
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,332
Keep in mind that
you will not get a refund.

123
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,210
We will come back some other time.

124
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,389
My ledger.

125
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,940
-Get them.
-Hey, run!

126
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,220
-Yes, boss!
-Boss!

127
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,767
-You little...
-Get over here!

128
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,355
-Where are they?
-Go get them.

129
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,552
-Get him!
-My gosh.

130
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,319
Stop right there. I'll get you.

131
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,822
-Stop them.
-Move away.

132
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,783
Darn it.

133
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,993
My goodness.

134
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,830
Follow me.

135
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,136
Money.

136
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,430
-Money.
-Get the money.

137
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,892
-Move!
-Look!

138
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,494
You are a slow runner.

139
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,288
Do you think this is funny?

140
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,386
OVERDUE INTEREST 40 BAGS OF RICE
OVERDUE INTEREST 20 BAGS OF RICE

141
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,725
OVERDUE INTEREST 10 BAGS OF RICE PER DAY
OVERDUE INTEREST 10 YANG PER DAY

142
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,226
OVERDUE INTEREST 30 YANG

143
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,698
What are you doing?

144
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,721
Although I have failed to find
the jade ring,

145
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,723
I feel like I have done a good deed.

146
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,354
Let us go and eat.

147
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,613
Try some of this.

148
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,949
-Welcome.
-This is good.

149
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,577
-May we have some more?
-Okay.

150
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,895
Chicken feet and soju are a perfect match.

151
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,819
No way.

152
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,613
Can you not eat chicken feet either?

153
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,533
What kind of a man are you?

154
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,004
My goodness.

155
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,049
Why do you even eat this
disgusting looking thing?

156
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,511
There is no other you.

157
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,055
There is no other me.

158
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,393
Just like that, there is no other
taste like this in the world.

159
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,694
If you wish to become successful,

160
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,696
you must not have prejudice
against people,

161
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,948
and you must not be a picky eater.

162
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,702
You were acting so manly
so I thought you were a real man.

163
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,925
My gosh.

164
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,065
How is it? Doesn't it taste delicious?

165
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,525
It is both sweet and spicy.

166
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,861
It is also chewy and crunchy.

167
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,659
This is when

168
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,787
you need to drink soju.
It makes it taste better.

169
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,544
Here. Bottoms up.

170
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,430
One more?

171
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,875
By any chance,

172
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,878
do you like me?

173
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,424
-What?
-I see.

174
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,968
You must be embarrassed
because you are a princess.

175
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,804
Well, don't be.

176
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,098
Just be honest and tell me the truth.

177
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,642
Stop using the jade ring as an excuse.

178
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,479
I totally understand how you feel.

179
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,148
What can you do?

180
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,026
It is not a sin to be attracted to

181
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,611
a handsome man like me.

182
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,406
But...

183
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,576
But I will have to refuse.

184
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,747
I am not an easy guy.

185
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,167
I really hate women who are reckless

186
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,836
like foals.

187
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,469
Are you actually drunk,
or are you just acting?

188
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,063
You're not worth the chicken foot.

189
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,004
Drink up.

190
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,597
What is this?

191
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:22,226
Mother made a special drink
to cure your hangover.

192
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,394
It is a mixture of kudzu, honey,
ginger, vinegar,

193
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,230
cucumber, dried persimmon,
blowfish, and...

194
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
-What else?
-Eel.

195
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,735
Anyway, she added every single ingredient

196
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,571
that is known to cure a hangover.

197
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,782
Although, I am not sure if it is
medicine or poison.

198
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:42,079
Here. It may taste bad
but drink it up for my sake.

199
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,956
You are always so nice to him.

200
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,209
Good boy. Go on and drink the whole thing.

201
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,920
Look at the dark circles
beneath your eyes.

202
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,215
Why do you drink so much these days?

203
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,804
Do you have a secret lover or something?

204
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,015
Nonsense. Your brother will
never do such a thing.

205
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,477
But then again,

206
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,564
I did hear that it is more important
to socialize over some drinks

207
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,566
if one wishes to become successful.

208
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,527
But please keep yourself healthy.

209
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,736
Okay, Mother.

210
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,002
By any chance, do you like me?

211
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,213
I am not an easy guy.

212
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,049
I really hate women who are reckless

213
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,635
like foals.

214
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,307
My goodness, what did I do?

215
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,309
My gosh!

216
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,190
Did the medicine make you sick?

217
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,952
Gyeon U.

218
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,080
Da-yeon is so pretty, is she not?

219
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,626
She is the most ideal prospective
bride out of all the women in...

220
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,426
What do you think about marrying Da-yeon?

221
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,595
If Second State Councilor Jeong
becomes our in-law,

222
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,138
it will also benefit our family.

223
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,266
Why you little...

224
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,687
Go away. You are driving me crazy.

225
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,815
I will be the middle person
and help you out.

226
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,819
Is it because you really have a lover?

227
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,364
My goodness, what lover?

228
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,116
What a relief.

229
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,786
I thought that the jade ring was
a token of your love.

230
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,377
Ring?

231
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:57,923
Well...

232
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,135
I did not take it intentionally, but...

233
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,941
What is this?

234
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,236
It is a work of art that was made by
a famous master craftsman

235
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,445
in the Qing Dynasty.

236
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,245
The carving of
the mandarin duck is beautiful.

237
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,289
You should try it on.

238
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,467
It fits you perfectly.

239
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,179
My brother sure does have a great eye.

240
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,475
It is actually a gift from my brother.

241
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,352
Gyeon U got this for me?

242
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,405
Lady Da-yeon.

243
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,331
Were you trying on the ring again?

244
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,335
Why did you call me?

245
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,045
You have a guest.

246
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,319
What brings you here?

247
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,237
Da-yeon, first,

248
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,364
I would like to apologize.

249
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,950
I do not understand.

250
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,245
The ring that my sister,
Gyeon Hui, gave you...

251
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,208
Are you talking about the
gift you gave me?

252
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,254
I was thinking of how to repay you
for such a precious gift.

253
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:06,134
I think there was a
slight misunderstanding.

254
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,303
What do you mean?

255
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,140
I must take it back from you.

256
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,025
What should I do?

257
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,402
I do not have it with me right now.

258
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,780
What do you mean?

259
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,990
I left it at the jewelry store to
have it cleaned.

260
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,119
If you tell me where the jewelry
store is, I will go and get it.

261
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,164
But I never agreed to return it to you.

262
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,374
Da-yeon.

263
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,964
I will see you at the lantern
festival the day after tomorrow.

264
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,176
Then I will decide whether or not
to return it to you.

265
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,138
Go!

266
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,654
Congratulations,
Second State Councilor Jeong.

267
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,950
Second State Councilor Jeong has the best

268
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,702
archery skills in Joseon without a doubt.

269
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,249
It is all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

270
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,043
You are too modest.

271
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,171
I would love to learn from you.

272
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,173
Please teach me your secret.

273
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,175
There is nothing much to it.

274
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,387
"Focus on the small things."

275
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,058
I just try hard not to miss
even the smallest movement.

276
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,644
That is all.

277
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,691
"The smallest movement."

278
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,410
CAN'T GO

279
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,327
LOW WALLS

280
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,121
SUGU GATE

281
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,049
No.

282
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,052
Do not even dream of going
outside the palace.

283
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,306
Did you already forget what His Majesty
said before he left for hunting?

284
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,018
My father returns tomorrow.

285
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,603
I will try to find the jade ring.

286
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,606
Okay, okay.

287
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,196
Get rid of this. Burn it.

288
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,000
Princess Hyemyeong.

289
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,627
I brought your favorite...

290
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,837
Snack...

291
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,093
-Princess Hyemyeong?
-Princess Hyemyeong.

292
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,721
Princess... Princess Hyemyeong.

293
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,139
Princess...

294
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,528
Princess Hyemyeong!

295
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,657
Hurry up!

296
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,833
Are these the only jade rings you have?

297
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,834
Yes.

298
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,596
Princess.

299
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,392
You look like a princess.

300
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,854
How could you be so perfectly beautiful?

301
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,319
I am sorry for causing a fuss.

302
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,115
I mistakenly thought that it was
a present from my brother.

303
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,284
Did he even get me a gift

304
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,745
in the first place?

305
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,538
Of course, he did.

306
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,498
It was my mistake.

307
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,169
I will find out if you are
telling me the truth

308
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,171
once I meet Gyeon U today.

309
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,159
THE PRINCESS SNEAKS OUT AGAIN

310
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,622
Lieutenant Gang.

311
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,883
What is going on?

312
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,514
Princess Hyemyeong disappeared.

313
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,934
I think she went out of the palace again.

314
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,728
How did you let this happen?

315
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,982
-I am sorry.
-If His Majesty finds out,

316
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,485
he will punish her with something
greater than copying down the customs.

317
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:03,736
Please help.

318
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,626
The Princess snuck out of
the palace again?

319
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,637
Councilor Jeong.

320
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,813
Is something going on?

321
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,857
It seems like

322
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,652
the night will be long tonight.

323
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,988
Pardon? What do you mean?

324
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,617
The sun is still shining brightly.

325
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,787
You punk!

326
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,665
You jerk. Come over here.

327
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,085
You pathetic idiot. You stupid jerk.

328
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,337
You little...

329
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,380
punk! My gosh!

330
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,635
You pathetic jerks.

331
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,554
How could you call yourselves gangsters

332
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,099
when you could not even catch
those puny little buggers?

333
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,605
Are you Do-chi?

334
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,612
What do you want?

335
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,104
Hello.

336
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,987
I should have come here first.

337
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,577
It is a token of my affection.

338
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,628
Please read it.

339
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,932
Lady Da-yeon, you are brighter
than the moonlight,

340
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,894
and you are more beautiful than a flower.

341
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,855
To me, you are the most perfect
woman in the world.

342
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,023
Mal-geum.

343
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,069
My heart is born anew because of you.

344
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,113
They say the women dressed up with
gems are beautiful,

345
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,116
but they surely cannot be more
beautiful than you are.

346
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,018
That was a waste of paper and ink.

347
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,647
You should focus on
your studies during your spare time.

348
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,235
I have a previous engagement,
so I will leave now.

349
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,868
Lady Da-yeon. Lady Da-yeon.

350
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,833
MOONLITE, MOONLIGHT
FLOUR, FLOWER

351
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,584
PURFECT, PERFECT
JEM, GEM

352
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,710
What is this?

353
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,678
Who did you request this to?

354
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,931
You paid 30 yang for this piece of trash?

355
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,184
-That cannot be.
-I paid 30 yang for that.

356
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,105
Lady Da-yeon's previous engagement
must be with Gyeon U.

357
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,649
Hey, be quiet.

358
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,317
What?

359
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,320
Gyeon U?

360
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,350
Will you look at that?

361
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,895
He's been missing for two days.

362
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,148
I will teach you a lesson.

363
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,572
What kind of story is behind that ring?

364
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,365
Why are you so desperate for it?

365
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,703
Is it a ring for your lover?

366
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,664
Nonsense.

367
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,209
It is just something I had kept
on behalf of someone.

368
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,919
Do not be mistaken.

369
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,008
I liked it so much that

370
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,928
I even thought about
not returning it to you.

371
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,180
To be honest, I also thought about

372
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,934
towing with your feelings by dragging on.

373
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,686
But

374
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,147
I could not forget how
desperate you looked

375
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,899
when you came to look for the ring.

376
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,952
Thank you.

377
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,705
I should return it to you,
since the owner wants it back.

378
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,297
Here is a small gift in return.

379
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,053
It is beautiful.

380
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,930
Honey.

381
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,819
Honey.

382
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,404
Are you here to meet

383
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,032
other women when you have me?

384
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,118
"Honey"?

385
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:10,079
When will you stop stalking him and
being so rude to him like this?

386
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,914
I remember you.

387
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,126
You are the lady I ran into last time.

388
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,752
Who are you?

389
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,881
As for us, we are a couple who
even spent the night together.

390
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,217
What kind of nonsense is that?

391
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:27,096
Why? Did I say anything wrong,

392
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,180
honey?

393
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,351
You tried to undo my coat string
at the motel.

394
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,479
My goodness, what is wrong with you?

395
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,690
You should report her right now.

396
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,900
There is no cure for obsessiveness.

397
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,155
What? "Obsessiveness"?

398
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,948
CRAZY WOMAN

399
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,950
Hey!

400
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,953
Is that how you described me?
You crazy pervert.

401
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,455
Which family are you from?

402
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,959
Why? Are you thinking about abusing
your family's power over mine?

403
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:00,171
You seem to have experience in
abusing your power.

404
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:01,964
What?

405
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,175
Da-yeon, I do not think I can stay
any longer.

406
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,801
I must go.

407
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,554
-Follow me.
-Where are you taking me?

408
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,306
Let go. Hey.

409
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,939
Da-yeon.

410
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,941
Da-yeon, are you okay?

411
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,943
Who is she?

412
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,737
Let go of me.

413
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,864
Let me go! Let go!

414
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,995
Why are you here?

415
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,747
I came to find my jade ring.

416
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,375
What about you? What are you doing here?

417
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,251
I came to find your jade ring.

418
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,215
Sure you did.

419
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,385
You act like you are the most
well-mannered scholar in the palace.

420
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,012
But outside, you have your
eyes wide open for women.

421
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,931
I bet you came here for women.

422
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,852
Did you think I would fall for
that lie of yours?

423
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,355
Hey!

424
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,482
Hey, Gyeon U!

425
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,444
The ladies are beautiful!
I do not think I will go home tonight.

426
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,286
Who... Who is this beautiful lady?

427
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,914
Wait a minute.

428
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:21,210
Is she that enemy?

429
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,171
"Enemy"?

430
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,176
What are you saying?

431
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,345
She is his lover.

432
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,139
Stop with your nonsense.

433
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,311
Oh, are you his friends?

434
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,398
Ever since he fell in love with me
at first sight,

435
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,984
he has been chasing after me.

436
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,570
I was talking to him
to set things straight.

437
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,366
A man who studied abroad
is indeed quite straightforward.

438
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,414
Well, I have booked a great spot.

439
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,583
Would you like to join us?

440
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,751
She has to leave urgently.

441
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,005
I would love to. Where is your seat?

442
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,091
-It is over there. Let us go!
-Let us go.

443
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,968
Okay, let us go.

444
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,262
What do you think you are doing?

445
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,057
They say if you want to know someone
get to know their friends.

446
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:21,145
I am going to check if you are
qualified to teach the Prince.

447
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,024
Wait for me.

448
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,486
Wait for me.

449
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,284
Today is the day of the
lantern festival. Am I correct?

450
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,952
Yes, Your Highness.

451
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,499
Today is a day that was permitted
by the government

452
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,543
for young men and women to
gather together and have fun.

453
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,173
It feels suffocating to just stay in
the palace on a day like this.

454
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,053
In the past,

455
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,598
I would have spent the night having fun.

456
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,061
Time really flies by quickly.

457
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,271
You are still young, Your Highness.

458
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,192
Then should we go to Namsan and
keep it a secret from His Majesty?

459
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,403
That is the best place to watch
the lantern festival.

460
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,030
Pardon?

461
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,700
I was just joking.

462
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,456
But then again,

463
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,417
the Princess is still very young.

464
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,545
It would be great if she could

465
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,005
enjoy the festival.

466
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,173
Then

467
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,134
us three can go...

468
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,972
No. Shall we take the Prince too?

469
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,140
What will you do if His Majesty finds out?

470
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,185
He's staying at the Royal Lodge today.

471
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,604
But you never know.

472
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,112
My goodness.

473
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,167
The King Game?

474
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,970
It seems inappropriate to play
a game that impersonates the King.

475
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,430
Well...

476
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,057
It is just a drinking game.

477
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,352
We do not intend on dishonoring
the King. Do not misunderstand.

478
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,022
What do you mean?

479
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,482
It seems more fun,
since it is inappropriate.

480
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,943
Let us play right now.

481
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,737
You really know how to have fun.

482
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,197
Let us enjoy the game then.

483
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,532
Let us do that.

484
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,082
Okay, let us take turns and
choose a stick.

485
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,141
Okay. Who is the king?

486
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,102
I am.

487
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,271
I am the king.

488
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,189
KING

489
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:15,152
Then who is the loser?

490
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,029
LOSER

491
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,786
I think I am the loser.

492
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,585
It is the first round,
so do not go too hard on her.

493
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,547
We are playing a game.
I cannot go easy on her.

494
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,717
Let us see.

495
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,262
Loser, listen carefully.

496
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,265
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman."

497
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,645
Say that out loud 10 times so that
everyone can hear you.

498
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,942
My goodness, that is a bit too much.

499
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,861
This is a game.
We should follow the rules.

500
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,824
What will you do then?

501
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,867
If you decide to go back home,

502
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,161
you will not have to do that.

503
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,585
Good thinking.

504
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,296
You better go home now.

505
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,803
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

506
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,515
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

507
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,352
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

508
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,356
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

509
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:38,360
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

510
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:42,239
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

511
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,408
-"I am a crazy
-My goodness.

512
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,702
-and obsessive woman"!
-How could she say...

513
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,412
such a reckless comment?

514
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,748
She is an embarrassment of
all the women in Hanyang.

515
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,835
Gyeon Hui, have you seen
that woman before?

516
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,213
Like she said, she is a crazy
and obsessive woman.

517
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,632
She is just a crazy lady who has

518
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,759
nothing to do with my brother.

519
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,720
Do not be bothered by her.

520
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,891
If she dishonored Da-yeon, that
means she dishonored all of us.

521
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,186
Let us teach that reckless woman a lesson.

522
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,771
Shall we do that?

523
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,657
I am the king!

524
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,625
I am

525
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,586
not the loser.

526
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,466
I am the loser again.

527
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,301
Tell me the penalty.

528
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,303
You better be prepared.

529
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,726
You two.

530
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,353
Change your sticks.

531
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,860
You are the one who said,

532
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,197
"This is a game.
We should follow the rules."

533
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,911
I will carry out your royal command.

534
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,748
-This is not fair!
-How dare you!

535
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,418
You must be out of your mind to
disobey my royal command.

536
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,711
You!

537
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,256
Tie him up right now.

538
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,426
-Wait.
-This is the king's order.

539
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,845
-I must follow the king's order.
-Wait. Just a second.

540
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,473
Hit the offender right now!

541
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,433
-Hey!
-I am sorry!

542
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,602
Hitting him once.

543
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,521
Hitting him twice.

544
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,942
Are you kidding me?

545
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,735
No, do not give that to her!

546
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,487
Hitting him five times!

547
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,364
Hitting him six times!

548
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,616
My gosh, stop it!

549
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,285
You are so handsome.

550
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,496
Hey, take that away from her.

551
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,456
-Stop it.
-Take it away!

552
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,584
-Leave me alone.
-Please help me.

553
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,627
Hurry up and stop her.

554
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,379
You should stop now.

555
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,714
My goodness.

556
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,468
Did we not see that man before
at the Police Bureau?

557
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,012
You have good eyes.

558
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,889
But who is that reckless woman?

559
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,474
My goodness, stop it.

560
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,018
Hitting him eight times.

561
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,811
My goodness.

562
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,938
She must have snuck out again.

563
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,441
-Do you know her?
-Of course.

564
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,319
She is a prestigious person

565
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,904
who we cannot even dare to stand against.

566
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,656
Let me hit him again.

567
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,700
-There we go.
-My goodness.

568
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,869
That is enough.

569
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,421
You should return before it gets too dark.

570
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,384
I might as well just stay and
fly a lantern, since I am already outside.

571
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,889
You are really out of control

572
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,099
and hopeless.

573
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,645
-What?
-I do not care what you do.

574
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,813
You can do whatever you wish.

575
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,153
Fine. Leave. I'm not asking you to stay.

576
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,963
We wish to have a word with you.

577
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,686
Just like how one person can ruin
the whole family's reputation,

578
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:45,148
you are ruining the reputation of
all the women in Hanyang.

579
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,428
Master Gyeon?

580
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,125
You shall go and apologize to
Da-yeon right now.

581
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,170
If she needs something from me,
she should come here herself.

582
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,715
How shameful of her to make
her slaves do the talking.

583
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:55,719
What? "Slaves"?

584
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,264
How rude! What makes you so confident?

585
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,725
Do you really need us to
teach you a lesson?

586
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,060
How dare you be so arrogant?

587
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,303
If you would like to fight me,
go on and give it a try.

588
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,602
Come on.

589
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,938
Come on.

590
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,150
Come over here.

591
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,152
Where are you going?

592
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,906
Those foolish brats.

593
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,088
She was here until a while ago.

594
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,299
Why did you not bring the Princess
to the palace?

595
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,932
We must find the Princess
before it gets too dark.

596
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,003
We still have a long way to go.

597
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,713
Will you continue walking?

598
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:41,343
When will I ever get the chance
to walk outside the palace

599
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,678
so leisurely like this?

600
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:49,017
That is why I suggested you to
come out more often.

601
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,398
Every time I decide to make
a far trip, it troubles our people.

602
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,069
How could I dare to easily take
such a far trip like this?

603
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,836
Your Majesty.

604
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,089
-Protect His Majesty!
-Yes, sir!

605
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,926
Hurry up.

606
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,057
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

607
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:52,205
"The King will cry bitterly
after losing his child."

608
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,865
It must be a dangerous job.

609
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,075
You must not make a mistake.

610
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,162
Once you finish your job,
I will give you twice as much.

611
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,913
You will soon find out that

612
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:38,001
I make sure I do my money's worth.

613
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,248
My gosh, where in the world is she?

614
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,459
Gyeon U.

615
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,848
Does she think this is
her bedroom or something?

616
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,268
Hey, wake up. Wake up.

617
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,110
Are you awake now?

618
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,283
Who are you guys? Let me go right now.

619
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,910
Where is my ledger?

620
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,206
Did you kidnap me just for that
petty little thing?

621
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,959
That and other reasons.

622
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,503
Where is my ledger?
You better tell me now.

623
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,131
Will you let me go if I tell you?

624
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,423
If you do not tell me,

625
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,301
I will behead you.

626
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,339
I said I will tell you if you let me go.

627
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,008
Can't you understand what's going on?

628
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,552
You must be the one who doesn't
understand what's going on.

629
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,637
I guess you do not need your ledger.

630
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,514
You little...

631
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,018
Would you like a few scars

632
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,645
on that pretty face of yours?

633
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,356
Put that down.

634
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,327
My goodness.

635
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,579
I am seeing a lot of familiar faces today.

636
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:21,998
Master Gyeon.

637
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,044
Guys, you should welcome our guest.

638
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,379
Move.

639
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,966
You little...

640
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,972
What are you doing, you punks?

641
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,484
What the hell?

642
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,163
Master Gyeon!

643
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,394
I guess this was done by
those who made the jirashis.

644
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,021
Please keep it well. Do not lose it again.

645
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,898
So the image of her keeps
showing in front of you.

646
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,569
She was my biggest enemy
whom I never wished to see again.

647
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,320
Are you interested in me?

648
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,239
Who ordered you to do this?

649
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,865
Just punish me instead.

650
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,534
Do you think I won't do it?

651
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,536
Did you exit the palace again?

652
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,664
He will not let this pass this time.

653
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,959
Dethrone the Princess
and lock her inside the chest!

654
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,878
