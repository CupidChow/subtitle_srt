1
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,008
The Prince and the envoys
arrived in the capital.

2
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,552
They will be here soon. What should we do?

3
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,639
Why is the Princess not here yet?

4
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,308
She is coming, isn't she?

5
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:07,085
This way.

6
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,231
The Princess is here!

7
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,862
You look more beautiful than ever,
Your Highness.

8
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,240
Thank you.

9
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,870
This is the Prince of Qing.

10
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,754
Hello, I am Darhan.

11
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,175
Hello, I am Princess Hyemyeong.

12
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,430
He is very good at speaking our language.

13
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,432
He only learned how to introduce himself.

14
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,934
He wanted

15
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,229
to introduce himself in your language.

16
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,772
I see.

17
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,276
What are you waiting for?
Introduce yourself to him.

18
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,905
My name is Gyeon U. I will be helping you.

19
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,491
Are you the famous Gyeon U?

20
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,910
I have heard a lot about you.

21
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,037
He is a very competent person.

22
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,874
I strongly recommended him
to be the translator.

23
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,253
He said, "I strongly recommended him
to be the translator.

24
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,755
He is a very competent person."

25
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,259
Your role is quite important.
I expect a lot from you.

26
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,052
I will do my best.

27
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,252
Welcome to Joseon.

28
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,844
Thank you for your warm welcome.

29
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,015
I am very touched that even
the Princess came to welcome me.

30
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,476
He is thankful for your welcome,

31
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,355
and he is touched that the Princess
came to greet him herself.

32
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,904
Your Majesty.

33
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,449
Please revoke your royal command.

34
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,495
Can't you take charge in
greeting our foreign guests?

35
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,539
They recommended you for the job.

36
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,917
Also, you are the only one
that I can trust.

37
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,261
Please take care of the Princess.

38
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,513
This is not an order.

39
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,478
This is a favor I ask of you.

40
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,003
An elegant lady?

41
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,421
Right, Your Highness.

42
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,549
Gosh, this feels so strange.

43
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,344
The Princess pretending to
be elegant and obedient.

44
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,971
That would certainly be
entertaining to watch.

45
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,650
You tamed the Princess

46
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,276
who used to be out of control.

47
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,862
You are the best.

48
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,950
From what I saw today,
they make a great couple.

49
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,245
The Prince of Qing seems
to be very fond of her.

50
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,497
If she continues to act coy

51
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,250
like she is doing now,

52
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,128
everything will go according to the plan.

53
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,171
-Don't you agree?
-Sure.

54
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,845
I am starting to like the Princess.

55
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,065
What brings you here, Chief Scholar Gyeon?

56
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,401
I could hear you laughing from outside.

57
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,320
What is making you feel so happy?

58
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,614
The princess is getting married soon.

59
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,908
It is a joyous occasion.

60
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,244
Do not be so happy yet.

61
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,872
The Princess is

62
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,417
still in this palace.

63
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,514
You must be tired from the long journey.

64
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,685
She said "You must be tired from
the long journey."

65
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,688
It is natural for a man to see a lady off.

66
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,901
He says it is natural for a man
to see a lady off.

67
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,491
I will come and get you in the morning.

68
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,077
-He will come to see--
-Thank you

69
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,206
for being the translator for my marriage.

70
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,041
Thank you, Master Gyeon.

71
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,543
I will look forward to your good work.

72
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,422
I will see you tomorrow.

73
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,551
I will see you tomorrow.

74
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,428
I will see you tomorrow.

75
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,196
Why don't we go grab a cup of tea?

76
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,043
Are you close with the Princess?

77
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,671
Why do you ask?

78
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,297
Answer me first.

79
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,385
She has been very gracious to me

80
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,055
while I taught the Prince.
There is nothing else.

81
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,724
I see.

82
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,061
I was hoping you would be close to her.

83
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,273
I came to propose to her

84
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,108
without even knowing who she is.

85
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,444
How can you live together for a lifetime

86
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,488
if you don't have any feelings
for each other?

87
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,700
I want to know everything about her.

88
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,618
All the good parts
and the bad parts as well.

89
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,595
Your Highness.

90
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,805
About the Prince of Qing...

91
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:01,058
He looks more handsome than I expected.

92
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,645
He is tall, gentle, and kind.

93
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,317
He is a very competent person.

94
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,279
I strongly recommended him
to be the translator.

95
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,740
I will do my best.

96
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,287
What a jerk.

97
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,582
I have committed a mortal sin. Please...

98
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,103
I want to know everything about her.

99
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,730
All the good parts
and the bad parts as well.

100
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,447
I pray to all the spirits.

101
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,533
Please help my son so
there are no bad rumors about him.

102
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,245
Please stop my son from running into

103
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,706
the Princess ever again.

104
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,584
Mother!

105
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,799
What? Is your father here?

106
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,093
You do not need to pray anymore.

107
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,595
Your concern is all solved now.

108
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,389
What are you talking about?

109
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,307
The Princess is getting married.

110
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,061
The Prince of Qing came all
the way here to propose to her.

111
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,479
Is that true?

112
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,273
Goodness.

113
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,858
Once she leaves for the Qing,

114
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
she will never be involved with
Gyeon U again.

115
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,238
My goodness, spirits.

116
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,617
Thank you so much!
My prays are being paid off now.

117
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,577
-Thank you.
-You only did it once.

118
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,913
Numbers do not matter.
What matters is the effort.

119
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,457
-Thank you.
-By the way,

120
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,543
Gyeon U is in charge of the reception.

121
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,672
Why is my son doing that?

122
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,508
-I do not know.
-Goodness.

123
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,260
Mother, I am home.

124
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,349
Gyeon U.

125
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,476
I heard you are doing the reception.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,437
-Does your father know?
-Gyeon U,

127
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,772
-is the Prince of Qing handsome?
-Goodness, seriously.

128
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,652
I told you not to get involved with her.

129
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,946
Why would you do such a thing?

130
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,116
It is not that you are the only one
who can speak their language.

131
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,409
Why is it you of all people?

132
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,912
Mother, let me change clothes.

133
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,372
Sure.

134
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,959
Can you stop doing that reception?

135
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,461
I am tired.

136
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,296
Could you step out?

137
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,881
Son.

138
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,716
I will talk to you later.

139
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,635
Stop it. I do not need anything else.

140
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,636
Mother,

141
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,263
let us talk later.

142
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,310
Gyeon U, there must be a lot of
people who can speak their language.

143
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,736
Prince.

144
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,572
Are you really not going to eat?

145
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,700
Are you going to starve?

146
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,578
I do not want to talk to you.

147
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,542
Prince.

148
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,378
Why did you lie?

149
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,673
You promised me you
would never leave me alone.

150
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,553
Are you saying I should not
marry anyone in my whole life?

151
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,557
But you are going too far away.

152
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,727
It is not.

153
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,604
Hyemyeong.

154
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,941
Are you really going to the Qing?

155
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,030
Do not go.

156
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,422
She is...

157
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
alive?

158
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,762
The Princess

159
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
has been looking for her mother.

160
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,976
That was why

161
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,312
she remained silent until now.

162
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,356
My King.

163
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,025
What should I do, Mother?

164
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,194
Must I

165
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,697
make her go to Qing?

166
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,787
Her being alive...

167
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,626
will not make a difference.

168
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,508
If we

169
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,510
find her now after all this time,

170
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,847
she could be put in danger.

171
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,060
It is right to keep it buried.

172
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,027
You have to stay strong.

173
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,990
Think only about protecting
the Princess and the Prince.

174
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,148
I heard you frequently visited
that butcher's.

175
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,744
Have you seen this man at other places?

176
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,665
I just saw him when I went
to buy meat. That is all.

177
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,627
Was there anything suspicious
about the owner?

178
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,463
Did you see anyone who
came by that place often?

179
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,589
Goodness.

180
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,716
Weren't you done
with your investigation already?

181
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,385
I don't know anything else.

182
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,936
It seemed like
Second State Councilor Jeong was

183
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,896
another regular of that place.

184
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,586
I have his letter that he left behind.

185
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,173
He mentioned

186
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,843
my mother in the letter.

187
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,513
I

188
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,808
cannot leave this country

189
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,561
before I find the truth about all this.

190
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,908
You couldn't find any witnesses?

191
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,911
The day when she was dethroned,

192
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,664
her palanquin was attacked by the bandits.

193
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,541
Do you remember?

194
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,963
How can I forget that?

195
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,132
I searched the whereabouts of her servants

196
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,509
except those who died that day.

197
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,220
They either died or went missing.

198
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,057
There are no records

199
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,226
and no witnesses.

200
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,169
Did you have a good night?

201
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
She said, "Did you have a good night?"

202
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,341
I could not get any sleep.

203
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,802
He could not get any sleep.

204
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,639
Was your Envoy residence not comfortable?

205
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,559
Was your Envoy residence not comfortable?

206
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:09,106
I was too excited to sleep
from the thought of seeing you.

207
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,573
He was too excited to sleep

208
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,284
from the thought of seeing you.

209
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,914
Was that a little too much?

210
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,083
Prince Darhan!

211
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,179
They have prepared a festival
for you, Your Highness.

212
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,392
How about enjoying the great view at
the peak of Mount Inwang today

213
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,687
and enjoying a festival at night?

214
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,065
How about enjoying the great view at
the peak of Mount Inwang today?

215
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,860
Great view.

216
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,864
I have seen enough of great views
on the way here.

217
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,659
I want to see the real part of Joseon.

218
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,246
He enjoyed the view already on his way.

219
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,208
Princess, could you show me around?

220
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,804
This way.

221
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,366
How do I look?

222
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,826
He is asking for your opinion.

223
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,353
That is pretty.

224
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,873
What is that?

225
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,060
Thank you.

226
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,030
Thank you.

227
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,055
What a shame!

228
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,222
You missed it.

229
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,266
You were so close!

230
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,185
I will see you next time.

231
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,479
Try the lucky arrows. three for two yang.

232
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,939
If you shoot the chicken head,

233
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,109
we will give you a reward.

234
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,155
It is your chance to present
your lover a pretty hairpin.

235
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,239
Try it!

236
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,908
-Honey.
-Me!

237
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,493
Come on out.

238
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,036
Here I go.

239
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,246
Pay first.

240
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,208
Great, hold it like that.

241
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,335
Pull it hard.

242
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,961
Now, shoot!

243
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,340
Gosh, that was not strong enough.

244
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,551
REWARDS: HAIRPIN, ORNAMENT, LANTERN

245
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,616
Princess, I will make the shot

246
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,160
and give that as a present to you.

247
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,247
He says he will win a present for you.

248
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,667
Tell him I will root for him.

249
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,503
She says she will root for you.

250
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,921
Thank you, Princess.

251
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,465
Would you like to give it a try?

252
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,218
No, no.

253
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,139
You try too.

254
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,266
I am okay.

255
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,017
Are you afraid that you would lose?

256
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,250
That was close.

257
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,466
How do you say "You can do it" in Chinese?

258
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,553
It's "jiayou."

259
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,391
-Jjayou.
-jiayou.

260
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,535
That was close. My goodness.

261
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,733
That hit the target!

262
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,362
Another bulls-eye!

263
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,793
This is for you.

264
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,711
Thank you.

265
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,675
May I put it on for you?

266
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,642
He wants to put it on your hair himself.

267
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,095
Master Min's letter?

268
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,807
He left the message about the
dethroned queen to the Princess.

269
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,727
Didn't I say so?

270
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,104
I told you something didn't feel right

271
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,023
ever since she visited
the Office of State Records.

272
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,776
Since when did you

273
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,237
raise your voice to me like this?

274
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,156
Do not forget

275
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,742
how you earned your place.

276
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,790
Search her room

277
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,417
secretly.

278
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,588
We should find out what is written in it.

279
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,325
Yes, Your Highness.

280
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,859
Your Highness.

281
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,776
I would've been okay wearing your shoes.

282
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,946
Then I would have had no shoes to wear.

283
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,200
It was more comfortable
than I expected though.

284
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,704
You can return those flowery shoes then.

285
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,622
You gave this to me already.
Don't be so cheap.

286
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,763
Princess.

287
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,348
Is there anything you want?

288
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,101
It is okay.

289
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,729
It is all right.
I want to buy it for you as a gift.

290
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,273
He wants to buy a pair for you.

291
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,652
It is really fine.

292
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,697
She says it's okay.

293
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,409
Let us get going.

294
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,904
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

295
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,491
This must be the spicy chicken feet.

296
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,952
It is very spicy. Will you be all right?

297
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,080
I will be fine.
I have always wanted to try it.

298
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,440
I have never tasted something
so spicy before.

299
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,942
This is really good.

300
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,944
I am glad you like it.

301
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,612
A drink is a must

302
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,365
with great food like this.

303
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,786
We should all take a drink.

304
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:07,342
Chicken feet and soju are a perfect match.

305
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,975
Go ahead.

306
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,020
You like having chicken feet with soju.

307
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,981
-He will...
-Do not mind.

308
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,902
What is it?

309
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,909
I was trying to order something else
since she cannot eat chicken feet.

310
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,080
I am sorry Princess
for not being considerate.

311
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,626
He is sorry for not being considerate.

312
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,087
Please order something else to eat.

313
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,612
Jerk!

314
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,492
"Jerk"?

315
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,913
What does that mean?

316
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,044
She is saying she feels great.

317
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,092
Jerk...

318
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,095
Jerk...

319
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,682
Feels great.

320
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,202
I will take care of her.

321
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,622
She is my lady.

322
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,958
I cannot let another man take care of her.

323
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,732
Goodness.

324
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,985
Why did you drink so much?

325
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,238
It just happened.

326
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,743
The Prince of Qing carried
you on his back.

327
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,578
He did?

328
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,041
Your Highness.

329
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,086
It is gone. That fake letter.

330
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,853
Like you predicted, the Queen
came and took it

331
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,647
when we left the place.

332
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,986
I see.

333
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,910
Princess,

334
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,580
I'm writing you this letter
as I don't have

335
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,249
the courage to face you myself.

336
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,837
Three years ago, I went to your mother,

337
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,632
but she was already dead by then.

338
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,802
She is dead.

339
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,596
I thought something incredible
was hidden in the letter,

340
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,723
but it is only about her death.

341
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,147
Maybe she wanted to pull a string
before leaving for the Qing.

342
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,024
We got anxious for nothing.

343
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,579
They are going to make a move.

344
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Find out anything

345
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,624
that could be
Second State Councilor Jeong's weakness.

346
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes, Your Highness.

347
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,380
They might try to do something
to the Prince once I leave.

348
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,926
I should at least prune the branches off
if I cannot pull the roots out.

349
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,887
Please hurry.

350
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,805
We do not have much time left.

351
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,122
I will take care of her.

352
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,125
She is my lady.

353
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,836
I cannot let another man take care of her.

354
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,088
"My...

355
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,216
lady."

356
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,984
Your Highness, please wake up.

357
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,078
The Prince of Qing

358
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,913
sent you all of them as he was not sure

359
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,707
which one you would like.

360
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,221
You do not look so good.

361
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,057
Are you sick?

362
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,060
No, I am fine.

363
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,871
What are you hesitating to say?

364
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,294
There...

365
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,589
There is someone

366
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,424
who I wish to get married to.

367
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,473
That is disappointing to hear.

368
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,145
All right.

369
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,857
Who stole your heart from me?

370
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,238
Who is it? Why are you hesitating?

371
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,534
It is Master Gyeon.

372
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,205
Do you mean
the son of Chief Scholar Gyeon?

373
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,166
-Yes, Father.
-No.

374
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,547
-Father.
-I said, no.

375
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,342
-I want to have him.
-Da-yeon.

376
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,510
You never refused

377
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,887
to give me what I want.

378
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,442
He gave her flowery shoes as a present.

379
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,444
Twenty pairs of them.

380
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,531
The Prince of Qing is

381
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,783
different indeed.

382
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,328
Yesterday, when the Princess saw
those shoes she seemed so happy.

383
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,206
But I wasn't sure which one she liked.

384
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,374
So,

385
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,168
I bought them all for

386
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,962
the Princess.

387
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,437
Master Gyeon.

388
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,189
What did he say?

389
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,986
The Princess seemed so happy
when she saw those shoes.

390
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,322
But he wasn't sure which one she liked
so he bought them all.

391
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,994
He should have thought about what
she would like the most.

392
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,538
The number of shoes does not matter.

393
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,998
Prince.

394
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,041
Be polite to him.

395
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,214
What did the Prince say?

396
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,343
Translate exactly what I said,
Master Gyeon.

397
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,511
Prince.

398
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,139
Watch your manners.

399
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,768
He must be very sad

400
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,021
about the Princess leaving.

401
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,620
Here.

402
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,125
I heard they all gathered today.

403
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,877
It must have been
an official family gathering.

404
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,129
Setting the date for the marriage
is all that remains.

405
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,341
Let me pour you a drink.

406
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,927
When should our exchange be?

407
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,471
As soon as possible.

408
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,020
Rushing things could lead to a mistake.

409
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,357
It is critical that we do this discreetly.

410
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,654
You are right.

411
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,074
Let us keep on drinking.

412
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,575
Here.

413
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,339
My drink tastes bitter today.

414
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,389
The Prince does not seem to
like me very much. Right?

415
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,350
I think it is all

416
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,311
because he is very close
with the Princess.

417
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,647
I see.

418
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,775
I must find a way to

419
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,069
make the Prince like me.

420
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,406
He will soon be part of my family.

421
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,205
Hurry.

422
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,006
What is the matter?

423
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,757
That is...

424
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,390
The Prince is missing?

425
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,393
They searched his residence,
but could not find him.

426
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,524
-Prince!
-Prince!

427
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,362
-Your Highness!
-Prince!

428
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,490
-Prince!
-Prince!

429
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,617
Prince!

430
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,626
-He is not in here.
-Let us keep searching.

431
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,295
-Prince!
-Prince!

432
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,173
Prince!

433
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,258
Prince!

434
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,594
-Prince!
-Prince!

435
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,803
Prince!

436
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,555
Prince!

437
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,781
Prince!

438
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,158
Prince!

439
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,788
Prince!

440
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,385
Prince.

441
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,887
-Master Gyeon.
-Are you all right?

442
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,264
Are you hurt?

443
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,684
Master Gyeon.

444
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,479
The Princess is very worried.

445
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,855
You should go back.

446
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,443
I really hate that my
my sister is going to Qing.

447
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,238
Prince.

448
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,740
I do not want her to go.

449
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,244
I am afraid

450
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,371
I might not be able to see her again.

451
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,407
Prince.

452
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,659
Hyemyeong!

453
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,333
Where have you been?

454
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,960
Hyemyeong...

455
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,304
It is all right.

456
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,992
Where did you find him?

457
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,372
He was in the sauce storage.

458
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,843
Where is he?

459
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,930
Where is my little brother?

460
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,350
I cannot seem to know.

461
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,602
Prince.

462
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,648
-Hyemyeong!
-I found you!

463
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,816
Why could you not find me?

464
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,902
Because you were hidden so well.

465
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,946
It is your turn to hide now.

466
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,739
I will find you.

467
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,909
Then I should hide well
so you cannot find me.

468
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,702
Then I will count to ten.

469
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,997
One.

470
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,291
Two.

471
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,252
Three.

472
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,462
Four.

473
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,589
Five.

474
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,721
Goodnight.

475
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,018
Master Gyeon.

476
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,439
Thank you.

477
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,536
I

478
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,080
really appreciate it.

479
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,015
I am worried about the Princess
who is leaving soon,

480
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,435
but I am also worried about the Prince.

481
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,607
I did not know he would do such a thing.

482
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,655
I am too worried.

483
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,325
It is not like

484
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,494
I can stop her from going to the Qing.

485
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,877
He kept glaring at the Prince of Qing

486
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,962
and now he caused trouble.

487
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,381
That little brat is

488
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,759
the spitting image of his sister,
causing so much trouble.

489
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,344
Still,

490
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,346
that will not change anything.

491
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,140
I heard the Princess has
been calm these days.

492
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,142
But what if she changes her mind?

493
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,103
You can comfort him well

494
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,315
so that he will not make any more trouble.

495
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,318
Until when should I be this anxious?

496
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,987
Why is it so hard to get rid of that brat?

497
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,698
It will soon be over, Your Highness.

498
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,217
Yes, my lord.

499
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,471
The Princess is suspicious.

500
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,431
Watch what she does outside the palace.

501
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,934
-Yes, my lord.
-And...

502
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,479
get me the details of Gyeon U.

503
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,898
Yes, my lord.

504
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,948
I really hate that my
my sister is going to Qing.

505
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,743
Prince.

506
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,287
I do not want her to go.

507
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,127
Are you a fool? Why can't you tell them?

508
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,046
Why can't you?

509
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,882
I wanted to shout it out,

510
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,050
but...

511
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,053
-they are your friends.
-What friends?

512
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,888
Those are not my friends.

513
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,973
I kept my mouth shut for your sake.

514
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,642
I decide whether to hold it in or not.

515
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,310
I did not ask you to hold it in.

516
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,312
Why could you not tell them

517
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,856
that I am your lover?

518
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,193
How can I when I am like this?

519
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,911
My goodness!

520
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,790
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

521
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,168
Why are you standing there?

522
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,295
What is that story about?

523
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:18,218
This is unusual.
You are interested in our story.

524
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,013
The title is Lovers in Paju.

525
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,976
They have to hide their love
due to their circumstances.

526
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,229
The story is about their desperate love.

527
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,315
Isn't it awesome?

528
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,109
I guarantee that this will be a hit.

529
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,861
"Why can you not tell them?

530
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,989
Why can you not tell them?"

531
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,324
"How can I when I am like this?"

532
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,875
This is so pretty.

533
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,296
It looks great on you.

534
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,798
It met the perfect owner.

535
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,096
I already have enough bags
my son bought for me.

536
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,850
This one is way better than
what he bought you.

537
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,143
Looks fancy.

538
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,399
You were sick in bed until
a minute ago because of Gyeon U.

539
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,862
I am not sure if I can take them.

540
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,158
It's a small present
so don't feel pressured to take it.

541
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,667
They are so pretty.

542
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,126
So pretty.

543
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,421
I will visit you often from now on.

544
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,382
Mother, I am home.

545
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,051
You are here. Come in.

546
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,015
Gyeon U.

547
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,396
Hello.

548
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,362
Are you uncomfortable around me?

549
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,366
I told you already.

550
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,912
Is it because of the Princess?

551
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,833
I hoped you would say no,

552
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,876
but you are making it too obvious.

553
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,257
She has no choice but to go to the Qing.

554
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,177
What do you want to say?

555
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,180
The Prince's installation to be
a crown prince is on the line.

556
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,810
I heard the Princess loves
her brother dearly.

557
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,895
She will go for certain.

558
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,441
-Thus, you do not--
-Excuse me.

559
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,909
Gyeon U!

560
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,501
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

561
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,549
Are you on your way to see the Princess?

562
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,427
Yes, I have to see her.

563
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,889
Good. I was on my way there too.
We should go together.

564
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,066
Thank you so much for
finding the Prince yesterday.

565
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,359
I did what I was supposed to do.

566
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,320
You saved my family member

567
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,406
so I must thank you.

568
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,869
It is great to be in Joseon.

569
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:16,289
I got to meet a great friend
and the love of my life.

570
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,459
I would have regretted greatly

571
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,586
if I turned down the invitation.

572
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,341
Invitation?

573
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,056
Right. Where do people of Joseon
go to make their wishes?

574
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,376
Princess.

575
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,129
What is your wish?

576
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,217
What is your wish?

577
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,224
It is a secret.

578
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,478
I can make it happen. Tell me.

579
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,358
I can make it happen.

580
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,154
Tell me.

581
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,502
May I tell you about my wish first?

582
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,343
My wish is to live with you
for the rest of my life.

583
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,438
Please go ahead and translate that for me.

584
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,995
What is it?

585
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,373
-Master Gyeon.
-Gyeon U.

586
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,127
I cannot translate that.

587
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,261
I cannot

588
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,056
translate that.

589
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,426
Help them so that they have no
trouble preparing for the banquet.

590
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,304
Banquet all of a sudden?
It doesn't feels right.

591
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,723
I am sorry that I am
an incompetent father.

592
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,394
After I leave,
take good care of my brother.

593
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,729
I am not sure what I should
prepare for her wedding gift.

594
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,065
You look very pleasant.

595
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,275
That is not true.

596
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,859
If it was Councilor Jeong's
recommendation,

597
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,736
does that mean he is
Councilor Jeong's person now?

598
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,740
I intend to give full support
on your career.

599
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,325
What should I do?

600
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,203
You owe me a huge debt.

601
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,330
I will consider the debt is paid

602
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,458
if you go to Qing without making a scene.

603
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,881
