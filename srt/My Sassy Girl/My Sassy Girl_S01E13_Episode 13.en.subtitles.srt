1
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,291
What brings you here at this late hour?

2
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,668
I have a question to ask.

3
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,962
You have something to ask?

4
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,718
Have you seen the new jirashis
strewn in the capital?

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
Is that why you came here?

6
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,681
You want to know if I have
seen the or jirashi not?

7
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,808
I want to know
who distributed the jirashis.

8
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,104
You speak as if I knew who did it.

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,690
I want to know

10
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,359
about Prince Chuseong.

11
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,081
You will regret.

12
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,832
It is okay.

13
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,169
It might break your heart.

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,923
That is why I came to you.

15
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,926
I know you do not care

16
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,137
about my feelings.

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,016
You are such a daring girl.

18
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,436
You do

19
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,231
take after your mother.

20
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,817
The apple never falls far from the tree.

21
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,862
Prince Chuseong...

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,368
committed adultery with your mother
who was expelled.

23
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,122
Also, he plotted a rebellion
to conceal the relationship.

24
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,832
But he was caught and killed.

25
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,751
That is why your mother was dethroned.

26
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,880
This is the truth
that no one has told you...

27
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,801
until today.

28
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,405
The Ghost Mask is here!

29
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,043
You look very shocked.

30
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,381
I told you would regret hearing it.

31
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,383
Are you expecting me

32
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,010
to believe such total nonsense?

33
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,846
You would not want to believe it.

34
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,764
However,

35
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,227
she would not have been
dethroned without a good reason.

36
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,189
Do not try to know more.

37
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,692
The more you know

38
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,111
about Prince Chuseong and your mother,

39
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,781
the more shameful you will feel.

40
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,575
I will see if I will feel shameful or not

41
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,578
after I meet with Prince Chuseong.

42
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,082
Do you not know that he is already dead?

43
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,086
People call him "Ghost Mask"
as he came back as a ghost.

44
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,922
He must have been so resentful

45
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,466
that he returned as a ghost.

46
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,437
You had better be careful, Your Highness.

47
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,358
-What do you mean by that?
-You know

48
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,403
what it means better than anyone.

49
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,465
Your Highness.

50
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,551
What did she...

51
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,555
What did she find out?

52
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,434
She might be just poking around.

53
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,062
Prince Chuseong...

54
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,024
No. Go find out who the Ghost Mask is.

55
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,275
Yes, Your Highness.

56
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,369
-You lost him?
-They were shooting arrows at him,

57
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,997
and then suddenly,
he disappeared like a ghost.

58
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,334
Stop talking nonsense.

59
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:20,296
Do you really think he is
the ghost of Prince Chuseong?

60
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,676
It cannot be Prince Chuseong.

61
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,387
It must be one of his followers.

62
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,099
But all of them died--

63
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,184
There was someone who survived.

64
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,104
Only one of them did.

65
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,108
It is Wol-myeong.

66
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,485
It cannot be Wol-myeong.

67
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,738
By the way, there is something
that bothers me.

68
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,366
When the Ghost Mask appeared,

69
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,036
one of the archers saw Master Gyeon.

70
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,997
Master Gyeon?

71
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,491
Mother.

72
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,371
Mother. Do not go.

73
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,749
You must take care of

74
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,087
your father and grandmother

75
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,548
for me.

76
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,050
All right?

77
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,160
I think I should get you
some dried persimmons.

78
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,622
It seems like you have trouble sleeping.

79
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,459
Thank you, Master Gyeon.

80
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,669
Did something happen to you?

81
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,214
You could not tell me

82
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,383
what you heard from Court Lady An.

83
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,261
It was about Prince Chuseong, right?

84
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,561
I knew it was about him.

85
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,607
-Your Highness.
-I am all right.

86
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,449
Mother worried about Father
and Grandmother...

87
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,537
until the moment she left the palace.

88
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,249
How could she commit adultery?

89
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,418
No matter what others say,

90
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,380
I trust my mother.

91
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,850
I will clear her name.

92
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,103
And

93
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,190
those who framed my mother

94
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,778
will pay the price
for what they have done.

95
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,866
They will certainly be punished.

96
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,335
Where is the Princess?

97
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,381
She is talking to Master Gyeon
in the backyard.

98
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,595
Should I go inform her
about your presence?

99
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,263
No.

100
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,724
I will just wait.

101
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,401
We should find the Ghost Mask.

102
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,404
Rumors say that it is Prince Chuseong.

103
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,701
He showed up in the Minister
of Administration's house.

104
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,411
Minister of Administration?

105
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,955
I think he is trying to send a message

106
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,750
to Councilor Jeong and his followers.

107
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,421
But I think he was shot by an arrow.

108
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,840
I saw his blood on the ground.

109
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,719
Please see if anyone has such a wound
in the Bureau of Medical Services...

110
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,472
Okay. I will take a closer look
at the patients.

111
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,516
I will look into it more, too.

112
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,821
Why are they taking so long?

113
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,618
She is coming.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,001
Your Highness.

115
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,935
Lieutenant Gang.

116
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,777
The Office of Investigation sent me
guards because of the Ghost Mask.

117
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,574
I am sorry. Did I make you wait too long?

118
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,785
No, Your Highness.

119
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,664
Let us get going.

120
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,792
Master Gyeon,
please take care of the Prince.

121
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,002
Yes, Your Highness. Please take care.

122
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,896
Master Gyeon.

123
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,736
It has been a long time.

124
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,532
You must be busy
chasing after the Ghost Mask.

125
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,869
You contributed to arresting
the Minister of Taxation too.

126
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,787
I guess you have decided
to become an investigator.

127
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,458
Would it not be better to work
for the Office of Investigation?

128
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,002
I can persuade the King for you.

129
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,421
No thanks.

130
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,719
If you run after two hares,
you will catch neither.

131
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,764
Be careful not to lose the post
you reinstated in.

132
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,477
Noble men should not tolerate injustice.

133
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,772
I can take care of my own business,
so please do not worry.

134
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,233
I didn't mean to offend you.

135
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,402
I am just saying this for your own good.

136
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,446
Of course. Do not worry.

137
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,114
Anyway,

138
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,159
I have something to ask.

139
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,582
I heard that the Ghost Mask
appeared at your house.

140
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,710
Is that true?

141
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,132
That is a totally absurd rumor.

142
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,718
Then be careful.

143
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,138
I heard that he is visiting the
houses of the Royal Court officials.

144
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,141
Your place might be next.

145
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,951
Welcome back, my lord.

146
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,828
There must be a rat in my house.

147
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,539
Pardon me? A rat?

148
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,625
Tell your subordinates to
keep their mouth shut.

149
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,419
If anyone finds out
about what happens in my house,

150
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,630
I will remove your tongue first.

151
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes, my lord.

152
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,040
You are here.

153
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,126
Are you trying to starve to death?

154
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,048
I just need you to accept my wish.

155
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,800
I already said no.

156
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,846
I also told you that I cannot give up.

157
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,180
What?

158
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,564
Father.

159
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,650
I...

160
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,695
trust you, Father.

161
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:28,802
Did anyone come by for herbs

162
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,721
like Hyeolgal, baekyoyang
or hwangdan today?

163
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,682
You mean the herbs that stop bleeding?

164
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,808
Yes.

165
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,937
Well, I cannot remember
all of my customers.

166
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,146
Or

167
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,107
have you seen anyone with an arrow wound?

168
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,819
Sorry? An arrow wound?

169
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,614
I have not seen anyone with it.

170
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,601
Did anyone have a wound by a sharp weapon?

171
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,894
A wound by a sharp weapon?

172
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,803
Your Highness.

173
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,266
Lieutenant Gang, what is the matter?

174
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,943
My goodness.

175
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,620
I apologize.

176
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,124
You just saved my hands from the fire.

177
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,043
There is nothing to apologize for.

178
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,595
Thank you for what you did to me.

179
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,306
Protecting you is my duty.

180
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,183
I just did what I had to do.

181
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,644
You are too stiff. That is not so good.

182
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,819
Lieutenant Gang.

183
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,240
What happened?

184
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,963
I came to see the Minister
of Administration.

185
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,841
We were told not to let anyone in.

186
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,179
It is a part of the investigation
by the Office of Investigation.

187
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,723
Move aside.

188
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,995
Ghost Mask?

189
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,375
We were reported that the Ghost Mask
appeared in your house.

190
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,129
Why would he visit my place?

191
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,713
You must know

192
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,882
why.

193
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,218
Are you saying that I am hiding something?

194
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,056
Leave. I have nothing to say.

195
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,685
Please contact us
if you need our protection.

196
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,429
He is hiding the fact that
the Ghost Mask visited his house?

197
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,681
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,809
You must

199
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,562
capture him alive.

200
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,691
It would be impossible for him
to distribute all the jirashis alone.

201
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,110
If we find out how he did it,

202
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,487
we might be able to catch the Ghost Mask.

203
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,327
I grant you full power

204
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,997
over the Ghost Mask investigation.

205
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,917
Your Majesty.

206
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,337
Find the Ghost Mask before they do.

207
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,406
Why are you so startled?

208
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,286
Where did you get that?

209
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,289
-Over there.
-Do not miss it!

210
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:53,460
This ghost mask will help you
feel much better.

211
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,671
He darts in and out of places.

212
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,339
There is Councilor Jeong above the King,

213
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,091
and the Ghost Mask
is above Councilor Jeong.

214
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,093
The Ghost Mask returned

215
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,930
from the netherworld to punish
the corrupt officials.

216
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,890
This is the latest fashion,

217
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,558
so I got one for myself too.

218
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,811
Come get one.

219
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,562
I will give you a discount.

220
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,941
You caught Min Yu-hwan
and the man with a scar.

221
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,277
And now you are after the Ghost Mask?

222
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,279
You must be...

223
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
a bounty hunter!

224
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,621
I knew it.

225
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,376
-Run!
-Run!

226
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,587
How dare you sell these masks
in this situation?

227
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,425
Your masks are even sloppy.

228
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,094
We will confiscate all the masks.

229
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,263
Clean it up and go back.

230
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,347
Okay.

231
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,933
Gosh, these are mine.

232
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,562
I need you to have this.

233
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,272
See you around.

234
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,357
Wait.

235
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,110
Goodness.

236
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,204
Aren't you are too old to play with this?

237
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,167
You are old enough to know
that purchasing such things

238
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
is not allowed either.

239
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,298
What is the penalty for bribery?

240
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,218
Why are you asking that out of the blue?

241
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,389
Give me what you have.

242
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,933
Hurry.

243
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,394
How stupid...

244
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,313
Hey!

245
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,651
Aren't you old enough to know

246
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,362
that receiving bribe is prohibited too?

247
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,122
Stop it now.

248
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,555
Mal-geum,

249
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,601
shall this handsome guy read your palm?

250
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,356
Can you read palms?

251
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,525
Of course. Let me see.

252
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,124
Your palm says...

253
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,503
you are born with luck
to meet a handsome man.

254
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,056
What is the matter?

255
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,268
She is Mal-geum, right?

256
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,353
Who is Mal-geum?

257
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,522
She is Da-yeon's maid.

258
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,608
-My goodness.
-Are they holding hands?

259
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,486
-This is unbelievable.
-Mal-geum did?

260
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,281
Gosh. You did not know about it?

261
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,410
We saw her holding hands
with Master Se-ho in the tea room.

262
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,412
They were in a good mood.

263
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,635
-Just leave.
-Leave first.

264
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,097
-You leave first.
-Listen to

265
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,392
what this handsome guy says.

266
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,728
Then I am leaving.

267
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,479
Sure.

268
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,109
Mal-geum.

269
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,028
Yes?

270
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,411
She is so beautiful.

271
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,052
My lady...

272
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,105
Follow me.

273
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,319
Master Gyeon.

274
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,529
Did you look into it?

275
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,032
Let's go inside first.

276
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,872
I asked the guards
of Minister of Administration,

277
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,793
and they said the Ghost Mask
showed up and shot an arrow.

278
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,086
And

279
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,756
a letter was attached to the arrow.

280
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,132
A letter?

281
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,551
What letter? What was it about?

282
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,513
"Right will prevail in the end.

283
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,140
You reap what you sow."

284
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,814
As one sows, so shall he reap.

285
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,503
Are you looking for me?

286
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,881
No, I am looking for the Ghost Mask.

287
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,803
Should I be angry or happy about that?

288
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,390
Are you jealous of the Ghost Mask?

289
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,227
Since you are looking for him now,

290
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,521
you must not have found him yet.

291
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,898
What about you?

292
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,777
I searched everywhere all day long,
but have not found him.

293
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,367
The Ghost Mask sent a letter saying,

294
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,578
"Right will prevail in the end,
and you reap what you sow"

295
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,705
to the Minister of Administration.

296
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,625
"Right will prevail in the end,
and you reap what you sow"?

297
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,794
He must have sent the same letter
to Councilor Jeong too.

298
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,798
But Councilor Jeong denied
the Ghost Mask visited him.

299
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,305
I am sure the Ghost Mask knows something

300
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,640
about their evil deeds.

301
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,813
What did the Princess say?

302
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,358
She threatened Da-yeon
to stay away from Gyeon U,

303
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,402
saying she will marry him.

304
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,654
Da-yeon was so shocked that she fell ill.

305
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,739
Did she really say that?

306
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,493
Da-yeon told me not to reveal
this to anyone.

307
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,663
You are the only one who knows this. Okay?

308
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,625
What has gotten into the naughty Princess?

309
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,668
The bigger problem is

310
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,380
Gyeon U.

311
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,423
What is wrong about him?

312
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,675
I am sure he also has feelings
for the Princess.

313
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,927
Stop it already.

314
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,137
When I spoke ill of the Princess,

315
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,098
he got really angry.

316
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,810
The Princess is why
he does not want to go to Jeonju.

317
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,829
You are back.

318
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,290
-What is it?
-Father is waiting for you.

319
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,257
I plan to ask the King
for approve of your resignation.

320
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,676
Father.

321
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,762
-I will also resign--
-I cannot do that.

322
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,848
Why do you want me to resign?

323
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,767
I asked you to trust me and support me.

324
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,979
We will move before the end
of the month. Get ready for it.

325
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,231
-Father.
-I told you

326
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,442
to stay away from the Princess.

327
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,862
It is you who did not listen to me.
What on earth are you doing?

328
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,323
I love

329
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,410
the Princess.

330
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,662
You cannot do that.

331
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,960
Love? What did you just...

332
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,628
Are you out of your mind, Gyeon U?

333
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,505
We plan to get married.

334
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,841
I said you cannot do that!

335
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,013
Do you really want to become
the King's son-in-law?

336
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,890
You know what it means.

337
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,642
-You cannot become an official...
-I do not care.

338
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
Gosh.

339
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,608
What is all this out of the blue?

340
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,984
Mother.

341
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,613
My goodness.

342
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,364
Gyeon U...

343
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,068
THE SECOND STATE COUNCILOR JEONG
IS ABOVE THE KING

344
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,866
He knows about the evil deeds

345
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,619
of Councilor Jeong.

346
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,602
Ghost Mask.

347
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,160
I will go this way. Scatter and search.

348
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,495
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

349
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,125
-Lord Chun-pung.
-Lord Chun-pung.

350
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,711
Lord Chun-pung.

351
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,048
-Here.
-My lord, please take a look.

352
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,549
Let me see.

353
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,718
THE ADULTERY SCANDAL WHICH HAPPENED
TEN YEARS AGO IS A LIE

354
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,138
"The adultery scandal which happened
ten years ago

355
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,017
is a lie."

356
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:08,277
"All the evidence was fabricated."

357
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,993
"Witnesses were bribed
to give false testimony. "

358
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,956
"You might be able to cover up
the sky with your palm

359
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,626
but not the truth."

360
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,311
It is already widespread
throughout the palace.

361
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,814
I think the Ghost Mask knows

362
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,941
what really happened ten years ago.

363
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,948
Your Highness, are you okay?

364
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,290
"Do not seek to gain recognition by others

365
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,167
but focus on understanding others,

366
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,753
said Confucius."

367
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,758
Hyemyeong.

368
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,807
Collect all of them now!

369
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,145
Never let

370
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,315
the Princess and the Prince
find out about this!

371
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,816
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,490
THE ADULTERY SCANDAL WHICH HAPPENED
TEN YEARS AGO IS A LIE

373
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,910
How does the Ghost Mask

374
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,788
know about this?

375
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,373
Please calm down, Your Highness.

376
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,584
Did Prince Chuseong

377
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,213
really become a ghost and return?

378
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,217
Your Highness.

379
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,594
We need to hold an exorcising ritual.

380
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,971
-The Queen Dowager is here!
-Go bring the shaman...

381
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,068
You are here.

382
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,574
Were you

383
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,285
reading the jirashi too?

384
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,166
Well...

385
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,670
I have already read one too.

386
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,096
I see.

387
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,100
A decade ago, Councilor Jeong visited me

388
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,563
with Court Maid Kim
and showed me a love letter.

389
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,692
But the jirashi says
the letter was manipulated.

390
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,405
Maybe it is a useless worry.

391
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,995
What do you think?

392
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,080
Pardon?

393
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,752
The letter was manipulated?
That is total nonsense.

394
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
How could such letter be manipulated?

395
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,006
Please

396
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,009
do not let the enemy manipulate you.

397
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,732
Have you seen the jirashi?

398
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,859
I have.

399
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,283
I am afraid that the Prince
might hear about it.

400
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,078
He will find it out someday, but for now--

401
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,288
Before he does,

402
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,166
we should prove your mother's innocence.

403
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,922
I will look into the evidence
and the witnesses of the case.

404
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,425
It will not be easy.

405
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,179
It has been a long time,
and it has been covered up.

406
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,889
Still, I will make it work.

407
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,033
Why is she so late?

408
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,453
Wait. Is she playing hard to get?

409
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,217
Mal-geum.

410
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,803
Mal-geum.

411
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,430
What are you doing here?

412
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,018
It is you, Chang-hwi.

413
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,397
Why are you peeping
at Councilor Jeong's house?

414
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,316
Well, that is...

415
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,151
Why can you not answer right away?

416
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,239
He seems suspicious.

417
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,283
Are you

418
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,202
the Ghost Mask?

419
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,122
What?

420
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,127
Hey, he is too short to be the Ghost Mask.

421
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,878
Right. He is a bit too fat.

422
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,381
He is the Ghost Mask. Look.

423
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,097
Is he?

424
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,147
My goodness. Do not be ridiculous.

425
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,108
What?

426
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,319
You must answer my question.

427
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,863
I asked why you were peeping at his house.

428
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,865
I came to see Mal-geum. Okay?

429
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,868
You are searching for the Ghost Mask
in broad daylight? How silly.

430
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,371
Mal-geum? Who is that?

431
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,249
I think she is Lady Da-yeon's maid.

432
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,381
I think the Ghost Mask uses flying
lanterns to distribute the jirashis.

433
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,217
Then what we saw yesterday...

434
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
Be on standby

435
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,432
so that we can move in
immediately after we see lanterns.

436
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,476
Yes, sir.

437
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,571
What do I do now?

438
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,035
Now even the old bag is trying to
suffocate me.

439
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,454
Even Councilor Jeong and Wol-myeong...

440
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,584
do not care what happens to me.

441
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,221
Your Highness.

442
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,599
"To study and to practice at times,

443
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,351
is this not a pleasure?

444
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,105
Confucius said, If you study hard

445
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,482
and practice it at due times

446
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,526
it will be a pleasure."

447
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,569
Prince.

448
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,031
Mother.

449
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,326
Master Gyeon, call it a day.

450
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,495
May I ask why?

451
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,457
Do I have to explain everything to you?

452
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,669
Did something happen?

453
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,506
No, Your Highness. I just

454
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,968
want to spend some time with you.

455
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,311
The jirashis are rapidly spread
throughout the nation.

456
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,735
I think the jirashis are made
to disclose what happened back then.

457
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,989
But we cannot arrest them
because of the jirashi.

458
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,658
I am so worried

459
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,745
that it will break the hearts
of the Princess and the Prince.

460
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,040
Please stay strong, Your Majesty.

461
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,335
He might really

462
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,130
have the proof.

463
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,386
There was a calligrapher who could
perfectly copy the handwriting of others.

464
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,265
He was really famous at that time.

465
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,060
What does it have to do with the jirashi?

466
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,735
It is rumored that the evidence
of the scandal was a love letter.

467
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:34,200
The love letter between Prince
Chuseong and the Queen.

468
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,623
So you think that the love letter
was written by the calligrapher?

469
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,749
Yes.

470
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,375
No way.

471
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,587
Even though our job is to make up stories,

472
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,631
but that has gone too far.

473
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,633
Where is that calligrapher now?

474
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,177
He died long ago.

475
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,554
When the scandal broke,

476
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,681
his house caught fire all of a sudden,

477
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,558
and the whole family...

478
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:05,564
That is why you suspect him
of writing the letter.

479
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,566
That must have been terrible.

480
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,653
By the way, that calligrapher

481
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,989
is someone you all know.

482
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,783
What?

483
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,370
-Who is it?
-Do you not remember?

484
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,247
It is Yun of the brush store.

485
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,458
-Yun of the brush store?
-Yun?

486
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,585
You have not

487
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,588
visited the brush store, have you?

488
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,423
Gyeon U visited there instead.

489
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,093
I did?

490
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,387
Do you really not remember?

491
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,349
This is strange.

492
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,771
The witness killed herself?

493
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,314
Yes, a maid confessed

494
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,360
that she had delivered love letters
to the Queen.

495
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,697
And she hung herself out of guilt
a few days later.

496
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,658
There was a rumor
that she was murdered instead.

497
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,452
People seem to be careful
because of King's order to cover it up,

498
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,372
but they still talk about it
after they read the Jirashi.

499
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,043
The Prince doesn't know yet, does he?

500
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,296
I do not think so.

501
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,507
The Queen called all his lectures off

502
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,260
to stay with him.

503
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,646
You got rid of the evidence
and the witnesses, right?

504
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,525
I took care of them without a mistake.

505
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,111
Then this is very weird.

506
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,449
You are the only one who survived
among Prince Chuseong's followers.

507
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,620
Then who could have pulled this off?

508
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,881
There is a court maid who confessed
to have delivered the letters.

509
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,799
Take care of her.

510
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,475
Mother, it is time to have medicine.

511
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,618
Who are you?

512
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,551
What are you doing?

513
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,179
I did everything you asked.

514
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,536
I killed both families. All of them.

515
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,956
I even set the brush store on
fire to eliminate all the evidence.

516
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,500
Nothing must have been found since then.

517
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,255
And you are the only one
who knows all this.

518
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,465
Are you

519
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,301
suspecting me now?

520
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,182
I do not think you silly enough
to betray me.

521
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,813
Catch the Ghost Mask.

522
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,234
I need to see who is behind the mask.

523
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,986
Yes, master.

524
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,521
Where did he go at this late hour?

525
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,653
As the Queen

526
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,823
wanted to sleep with him,

527
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,034
she took him to her residence.

528
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,749
As long as he is all right, it is fine.

529
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,663
Yun of the brush store...

530
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,375
"The blind mother ruins everything."

531
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,577
The blind mother ruins everything.

532
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,669
I suggest

533
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,966
that you stop working at the Bureau
of Medical Services for a while.

534
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,594
You know

535
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,180
things are chaotic outside the palace.

536
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,183
I am all right.

537
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,560
Princess.

538
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,023
Is it because of the jirashi

539
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,776
the Ghost Mask distributed?

540
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,863
Have you already heard of it?

541
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,414
I am sorry.

542
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,630
I understand

543
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,216
that you did not have a choice.

544
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,287
THE BLIND MOTHER RUINS EVERYTHING

545
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,278
Are they doing something without us again?

546
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,782
Lieutenant Gang has so many secrets.

547
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,785
I think he does not like us, because
we always hang out with Chang-hwi.

548
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,205
Goodness.

549
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,624
Stop it. He does not deserve it.

550
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,169
He deserves a harder beating.

551
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,963
-Gosh.
-Dear me.

552
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:54,259
By the way, until when should we
crack down on mask vendors?

553
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,844
I overheard

554
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,264
that they will be able to catch him
by using some flying lanterns.

555
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,892
I hope they arrest him
as soon as possible.

556
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,227
-Let us go have a meal.
-Okay.

557
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,275
Flying lanterns?

558
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,197
You want to resign?

559
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,365
Chief Scholar Gyeon,

560
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,035
why do you and even Master Gyeon
want to resign?

561
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,953
My apologies.

562
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,916
What is all this all of a sudden?

563
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,251
I just want to spend the rest of my life

564
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,922
in the country with my family
and train young scholars.

565
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,799
I need your help

566
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,927
especially in the
current chaotic situation.

567
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,227
I apologize, Your Majesty.

568
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,948
Chief Scholar Gyeon.

569
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,440
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

570
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,736
The Queen was dethroned because of that?

571
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,949
The rumor about her affair with
Prince Chuseong was widespread.

572
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,202
But she was dethroned
after the hand-written poster was

573
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,829
posted on the board.

574
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,666
Right. And the jirashi about it were
all over the capital, right?

575
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,293
That is right.

576
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,264
Master Gyeon.

577
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,653
Master Gyeon.

578
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,514
Are you okay?

579
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,075
I am okay.

580
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,913
I am really all right.

581
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,418
You should take some medicine.

582
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,341
You are like a real nurse.

583
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,928
Drink it. Or you will fall sick again.

584
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,288
You do not have to walk me home.

585
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,499
It is me who should walk you home.

586
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,877
I said I feel just fine now.

587
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,385
Byeol, what is that?

588
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,387
Are those flying lanterns?

589
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,265
The lantern festival is over.
Why are there lanterns now?

590
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,899
-Please head to the palace.
-What is the matter?

591
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,818
I will tell you when I come back.

592
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,486
Master Gyeon.

593
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,156
-Take care of her.
-Yes, master.

594
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,846
Master Gyeon!

595
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,214
THE BLIND MOTHER RUINS EVERYTHING

596
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,647
Master Gyeon!

597
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,235
Wake up, Master Gyeon!

598
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,322
Master Gyeon!

599
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:16,701
Wake up, Master Gyeon!

600
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,175
Master Gyeon!

601
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,014
Hang in there!

602
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,017
Master Gyeon!

603
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,631
Wol-myeong is captured?

604
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,132
Remove him.

605
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,052
Wol-myeong knows too much about us.

606
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,180
If necessary,
we will use someone else's sword.

607
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,474
I will let you out by all means.

608
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,643
You should give up.

609
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,229
Councilor Jeong
will not let you stay alive.

610
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,399
Please do not get close
to Gyeon U anymore.

611
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,736
There is something you must know.

612
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,572
It was all my fault.

613
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,156
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

614
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,493
How dare you keep telling lies,
even when I have the evidence!

615
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,744
Actually...

616
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,082
I apologize, Your Highness.

617
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,214
