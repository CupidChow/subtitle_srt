1
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,174
Please tell me

2
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,178
what happened ten years ago.

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,890
I know nothing.

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,059
-Please.
-I no longer

5
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,728
belong to this world.

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,274
Please do not ask me
what happened in this world.

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,904
Please tell me anything.

8
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,989
Before you left the palace...

9
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:15,158
Why do you want to know so badly?

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,537
I want to find

11
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,290
the mother of my lover.

12
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,756
Tell her to stop looking for her mother.

13
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,259
The mother of the Princess

14
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,805
was deposed after she committed
adultery with Prince Chuseong.

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,973
The Princess will be placed in danger

16
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,309
if she finds her mother.

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,645
What do you mean by that?

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,730
She committed adultery?

19
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,609
Please do not ask anymore.

20
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,920
It was him at the end
who approved Mother's dethronement

21
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,256
and covered up the incident.

22
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,176
Because I have no way
to find out the truth otherwise.

23
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,721
No one tells me

24
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,390
and no one

25
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,268
can tell me.

26
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,728
I do not know what you are looking for,

27
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,105
but stop here.

28
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,315
Do not attempt to know more.

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,734
Forget everything you have found out.

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,027
Grandmother.

31
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,639
Your Highness, please wait inside.

32
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,683
You will catch a cold.

33
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,187
It is cold outside. You go inside.

34
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,862
Master Gyeon.

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,913
Why are you out here?

36
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,789
How did it go?

37
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,708
Did you meet her?

38
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,758
She knows nothing?

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,970
She had to leave the palace
as she caught cholera.

40
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,180
When she returned,

41
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,641
the incident was already covered up.

42
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,477
I will go meet her myself.

43
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,979
You cannot go there.
It will get dark soon.

44
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,981
If she sees my face,

45
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,859
she might remember something
that can be a clue.

46
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,322
-Let me go.
-Your Highness.

47
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,248
Do not be so disappointed.

48
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,416
I will

49
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,419
find another way.

50
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,047
-My baby.
-Mother.

51
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,842
-My baby. Let go of me.
-Mother.

52
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,344
My baby. Let go of me.

53
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,347
My baby.

54
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,725
Mother!

55
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,226
Mother!

56
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,230
Mother!

57
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,109
Mother!

58
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,238
My baby.

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,240
My baby...

60
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,190
"Right will prevail in the end.

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,192
You reap what you sow."

62
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,408
It is the same letter
he sent me last night.

63
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,412
Who in the world is doing this?

64
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,873
It's Prince Chuseong's seal.

65
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,208
But Prince Chuseong is...

66
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,005
It cannot be Prince Chuseong.

67
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,892
I will hunt you down

68
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,561
even after my death

69
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,398
to punish you for your sins.

70
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,972
So Prince Chuseong is back?

71
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,109
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

72
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,071
Whether she was falsely accused
by Councilor Jeong,

73
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,574
or even if it was true,

74
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,077
I believed hiding it

75
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,873
from you for now is for your sake.

76
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,629
Master, you have a visitor
from the palace.

77
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,388
We did our best to stop her,
but she insisted on going to the temple.

78
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,173
This is the temple.

79
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,349
-Master Gyeon.
-Your Highness.

80
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,270
I have given it a lot of thought,

81
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,189
but I think

82
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,192
I must meet Court Lady An at least once.

83
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,614
But it is too late now. Let us head back.

84
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,741
What is the matter?

85
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:58,538
Is there a reason why
I must not meet Court Lady An?

86
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,668
-Is that right?
-Your Highness.

87
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,297
I will be able to know the reason
when I meet her.

88
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,518
What do you mean that she left?

89
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,020
After the master visited her today,

90
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:27,149
she packed her things and left,
saying it was time to leave.

91
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,737
Do you know where she is headed to?

92
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,789
Please go inside and rest.

93
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,794
Court Lady An knows something, right?

94
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,174
As I said, no.

95
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,389
What is that look on your face?

96
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,893
What do you mean?

97
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,603
I know you are hiding something.

98
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,229
I am not.

99
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,565
Why can't you tell me about it?

100
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,276
-What is the reason?
-It is just...

101
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,779
I do not want to hear excuses.

102
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,080
I thought I could trust you at least.

103
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,750
But I guess I was wrong.

104
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,374
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

105
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,436
The blind mother ruins everything.

106
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,676
-Gyeon U.
-Yes?

107
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,477
Did you have a nightmare again?

108
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,688
-I am all right now.
-You are not.

109
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,566
Your handsome face has gotten thinner.

110
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,779
Did you make your decision?

111
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,573
About going to Jeonju
after you resign from your post.

112
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,994
I have not changed my mind.

113
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,622
Gyeon U, please.

114
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,375
-Relax for some time.
-Mother.

115
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,337
I do not want you to suffer
like you did anymore.

116
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,548
I do not want to either.

117
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,633
Please do not worry about me.

118
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,056
Are you going to work? Have a good day.

119
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,355
Mother, was Gyeon U sick in the past?
When was it?

120
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,649
You do not need to know.

121
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,609
Why don't you tell me about it?

122
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,278
Am I not a part of this family?

123
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,576
What happened to him?

124
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,788
Something must have happened.

125
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,677
The Princess wants to be alone
and rest today.

126
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,723
How is her condition?

127
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,146
Actually,

128
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,732
she did not
get a wink of sleep last night.

129
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,542
He left.

130
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,839
I do not think
he was able to sleep either.

131
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,841
He looked quite pale.

132
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,135
I did not ask.

133
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,764
I just thought you would want to know.

134
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,766
I do not want to know at all.

135
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,142
I see.

136
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,063
Let us get prepared to go
to the Bureau of Medical Services.

137
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,858
-Your Highness.
-What is it?

138
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,152
I am not interested
in how Master Gyeon is!

139
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,071
That is not what I am about to say.

140
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,908
Should I throw that away?

141
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,047
I found it on my way here.

142
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,468
Are you here to see me?

143
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,012
I just happened to pass by.

144
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,848
I know you came to see me with flowers.

145
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,539
"'Do not seek
to gain recognition by others

146
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,541
but focus on understanding others,'

147
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,835
said Confucius."

148
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,089
I thought I could trust you at least.

149
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,925
But I guess I was wrong.

150
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,220
"Confucius said, 'Do not eat or live
only for pleasure.'

151
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
only for pleasure.'"

152
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,018
Master.

153
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,688
Master.

154
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,816
Yes, Your Highness.

155
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,943
Is there something that worries you?

156
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,821
No, there is not.

157
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,906
You can tell me.

158
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,245
It's okay.

159
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,540
I might be able to help you.

160
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,090
Master, I know you think
I am too young to help you.

161
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,893
So,

162
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,856
a friend of a friend of a friend

163
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,860
came to know a sad story
that would break his lover's heart.

164
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,780
And as his lover found out
that he hid the story from her,

165
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,616
a misunderstanding arose.
Is that what you are saying?

166
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,535
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,044
I think he should be honest with her.

168
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,089
Be honest?

169
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,648
Hello, there.

170
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,152
What a coincidence.

171
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,072
We have met the other day...

172
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,910
Do you work
for the Bureau of Medical Services?

173
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,079
Or are you here to volunteer?

174
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,832
-Yes.
-I see.

175
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,044
By the way, I have heard
that the Princess also works here.

176
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,170
Where is she?

177
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,840
It is a perfect chance
to see the Princess in person.

178
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,969
I do not know.
She might have left already.

179
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,179
She left?

180
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,225
I wanted to see
how beautiful she is as others say so.

181
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,103
Would she come tomorrow again?

182
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,690
Anyway, what brings you here?

183
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,819
I drank too much last night.

184
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,737
I have a stomachache.

185
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,826
It is kudzu.

186
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,619
Kudzu tea helps

187
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,788
settle the stomachache
caused by excessive drinking.

188
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,874
Thank you.

189
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,713
By the way, why do you look worried?

190
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,591
Pardon? I do not.

191
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,886
You can fool everyone but me.

192
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,804
I cannot cure illness

193
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,265
but I am great at relieving
others' worries.

194
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,102
Then tell me.

195
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,022
I must repay you for this.

196
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,358
We must stick
to the principle of give and take.

197
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,235
Do you not know about it?

198
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,743
He is hiding something from you.

199
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,746
So he is telling a lie.

200
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,915
I did not say he lied to me.

201
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,000
They are the same.

202
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,464
-Break up with him immediately.
-Sorry?

203
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,051
I guess that is not what you want.

204
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,139
There must be a reason
why he keeps it to himself.

205
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,060
Then what do you think
the reason would be?

206
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,355
How am I supposed to know?
I am dying to know it too.

207
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,070
Judging from what you said,
he must be a prudent man.

208
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,239
I think he is suffering by himself

209
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,325
because it is something
that his lover must not know.

210
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,786
This is what I think.

211
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,080
You should believe in your lover.

212
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,420
By the way, is your lover...

213
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,258
someone I know?

214
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,052
Well... I do not know.

215
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,250
What matters to me is

216
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,128
how you feel now.

217
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,305
My goodness. You are bleeding.

218
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,099
You must not be distracted
when using a knife.

219
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,309
I will go bring a physician.

220
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,353
Do not make a fuss over a slight cut.

221
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,896
It is not a slight cut.

222
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,362
Do you think it is a slight cut?

223
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,493
-What do you think you are doing?
-You need to get treatment.

224
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,478
Does it hurt a lot?

225
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,024
What do you think?
Of course, it hurts a lot.

226
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,359
I also spent...

227
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,197
a painful night yesterday.

228
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,335
"You will be hugely shocked,

229
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,880
and that is why
I do not want you to know."

230
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,218
I think she will understand you
if you tell her honestly.

231
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,304
Confucius also said,

232
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,933
"When a person should be spoken with, and
you don't speak with them, you lose them.

233
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,103
When a person shouldn't be spoken with and
you speak to them, you waste your breath.

234
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,022
The wise do not lose people,

235
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,441
nor do they waste their breath."

236
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,572
Thank you, Your Highness.

237
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,158
You gave me a great lesson today.

238
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,079
Please tell the friend
of the friend of the friend

239
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:38,375
that I hope he solves
the misunderstanding with his lover.

240
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,303
Your Highness, actually...

241
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,013
You do not need to tell me.

242
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,309
-Why...
-There must be a reason

243
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,645
why you aren't telling me.

244
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,984
I also tried to put myself in your shoes.

245
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,198
I am sorry.

246
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:15,370
I said mean things to you last night.

247
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,130
Why are you staring at me?
It is embarrassing.

248
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,469
Because you are so lovely.

249
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,551
Really?

250
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:15,138
-I was also surprised.
-It is unbelievable.

251
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,895
Did you hear that Da-yeon fell sick?

252
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
Is she sick? What is wrong?

253
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,317
It is obvious.
Her resentment must have made her sick.

254
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,404
Is it because of Master Gyeon?

255
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,952
It was Master Gyeon

256
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,537
who made the Prince of Qing leave.

257
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,332
-Really?
-Yes.

258
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,293
I heard that he often visits
the Bureau of Medical Services

259
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,505
where the Princess works these days.
Both are closer than ever.

260
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:53,009
I cannot understand why he likes
such a bad-tempered wench.

261
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,929
Master Gyeon has
a very eccentric taste in women.

262
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,097
Exactly.

263
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,726
Should we look in on Da-yeon?

264
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,482
We will get in trouble if we do not.

265
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,276
Of course, we will.

266
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,739
Maybe not.

267
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,077
Our visit might annoy her more
as she is full of anger now.

268
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,745
Maybe.

269
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,622
What do we do?

270
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,214
Come closer. Let us visit Chang-hwi.

271
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,425
-Okay.
-Let us go.

272
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,434
What if he dies?

273
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,728
He will not die that easily.
He will just have muscular pain.

274
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,273
No way. You know a sudden change
is a sign of near death.

275
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,734
After Lady Da-yeon flatly rejected him,

276
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,485
he drank every single day.

277
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,529
And now, he is working too hard.

278
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,573
It scares me a lot.

279
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,701
Do we have to tell him

280
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,746
-about Lady Da-yeon?
-Do not.

281
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,291
What happened to Lady Da-yeon?

282
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,295
-What happened to her?
-What?

283
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,133
What is it? Tell me.

284
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,179
-We were about to tell you.
-Right.

285
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,805
Actually...

286
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,143
You cannot have Master Gyeon.
Give up on him.

287
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:33,276
I cannot believe
he has not contacted me since then.

288
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,695
What did you just say?

289
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,449
It is nothing, my lady.

290
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,327
Stop annoying me and leave.

291
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,245
Yes, my lady.

292
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,711
Da-yeon, this is Gyeon Hui.

293
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,799
Just lie down.

294
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,761
How can I lie down in front of a guest?

295
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,806
What do you mean by "guest"?
I am your family.

296
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,311
By the way, what brings you here?

297
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,189
I came to look in on you
as I heard that you fell ill.

298
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,192
You look so pale.

299
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,238
-Thank you.
-Why are you so sick?

300
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,618
I just feel a little sluggish.

301
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,121
Why is that so all of a sudden?

302
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,208
Did the Princess say something to you

303
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,419
on the day you visited
the Bureau of Medical Services?

304
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,761
It is not a big deal.

305
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,389
It seems like a big deal.

306
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,684
It is really nothing.

307
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,939
Da-yeon, you can tell me everything.

308
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,400
We are so close
that we can share anything.

309
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,284
Then keep this a secret from Master Gyeon.

310
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,621
The Princess might distort it
and come between us.

311
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,585
I will keep my mouth shut,
so do not worry.

312
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,514
They told me that they're going somewhere
to treat her finger.

313
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,725
Where are they?

314
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,209
I found you...

315
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,931
I do not want to ruin the mood,

316
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,892
but you should go back to the palace.

317
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,355
Okay. Just give us 15 minutes.

318
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,610
You should leave in 15 minutes then.

319
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,910
Why did you ask him for 15 minutes?

320
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,662
What are you going to do
for those 15 minutes?

321
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,790
You are naughty.

322
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,875
What do you mean?

323
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,008
You are the one who is naughty.

324
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,928
Let us stay here together

325
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,764
like this for the next 15 minutes.

326
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,558
Like this?

327
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,362
I am so jealous.

328
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
What?

329
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,999
These medicinal herbs
will invigorate her body.

330
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,834
Give it to Lady Da-yeon.

331
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,963
I will.

332
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,550
Wait.

333
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,720
Do not tell her that I brought it.

334
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,555
Why not?

335
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,516
Just do not.

336
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,562
Make sure that she drinks it, please.

337
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,160
Master Park brought it for you.

338
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,162
Take it away.

339
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,873
My lady,

340
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,918
you have not eaten anything
for a few days.

341
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,462
You might fall seriously ill
if you eat nothing.

342
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,881
Did Father say anything today?

343
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,633
No, my lady.

344
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,095
He said
it is an invigorating herbal tonic.

345
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,556
Please drink it before it goes cold.

346
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,933
I said I do not want it!

347
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,736
Are you hurt?

348
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,449
I am hurt too.

349
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,914
Gosh, I cannot put
any emotions into my work.

350
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,626
What has gotten into you?

351
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,505
-It hurts.
-Where?

352
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,970
I do not know either.

353
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,474
I have no idea
what is wrong with me at all.

354
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,686
You are pretending.

355
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,775
Shall we go to Morangak
or Hongruwon to drink?

356
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,568
Let us enjoy the full treatment.

357
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,071
Gosh. That is not what I need. Stop it.

358
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,535
I said he is having a meeting.
You cannot just barge in here.

359
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,162
Mal-geum.

360
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,165
We need to talk.

361
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,962
I will be right back.

362
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,797
-Hey, stop.
-Wait.

363
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,260
Gosh.

364
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,558
How can you not come after me
just because I told you not to?

365
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,185
I ran after you, but you were too fast--

366
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,105
How could a man fail
to catch up to a woman?

367
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,858
Being handsome doesn't mean
you can act that way.

368
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,986
What?

369
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,740
This is why Mom told me
not to date handsome guys.

370
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,616
They play hard to get.

371
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,788
Goodness.

372
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,208
-Did you just laugh?
-Wait.

373
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,004
Well, Mal-geum.

374
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,173
-Yes?
-Do you really think...

375
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,217
I look the most handsome in the world?

376
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,471
You never look into a mirror?

377
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,892
My gosh.

378
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,108
Fine. Let us go have lunch.
Your handsome honey will treat you.

379
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm still mad at you...

380
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,827
-Come with me, my baby.
-What are you doing?

381
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,542
What is this?

382
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,629
I heard you have trouble sleeping.
Open it when you get home.

383
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:57,929
Right. It is because of you.
You should be responsible for it.

384
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,222
Because of me?

385
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,682
Why do you keep appearing in my dream?

386
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,935
It is really hard to sleep.

387
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,857
Take care.

388
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,028
This is bad. I do not want to go.

389
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,823
You should leave.

390
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,158
-Please go inside first.
-You leave first.

391
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,910
Please go in first.

392
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:27,041
I will count to three.
Then we will get moving at the same time.

393
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,629
All right. In one, two, three.

394
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,801
Why are you still here?

395
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,303
-Get going.
-Please go in first.

396
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,932
-I will, after I see you leave.
-Then let's go together.

397
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,217
You just smiled.

398
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,931
I am glad to see your smile.
You look much more handsome.

399
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,854
I heard

400
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,608
that your mother passed away a while ago.

401
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,154
I am sure your mother also

402
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,699
wants you to smile brightly
as soon as possible.

403
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,409
Smile.

404
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,996
Then good things will happen to you.

405
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,276
Dried persimmon
helps you fall asleep easily.

406
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,486
Do not forget to eat it
before you go to sleep.

407
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,101
It is so sweet.

408
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,283
Are you eating alone? You are so mean.

409
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,079
You cannot just come in without asking.

410
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,876
Let me have one.

411
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,423
No.

412
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,261
Is it a gold persimmon or something?

413
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,018
It's just an ordinary persimmon.

414
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,812
Why are you here at this late hour?

415
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,192
Well...

416
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,279
Da-yeon told me

417
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,324
to keep it a secret from you
no matter what,

418
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,118
-but the Princess...
-That is it. Stop.

419
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,996
Why? Just hear me out.

420
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,124
You should know how brazen the Princess--

421
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,335
I said stop.

422
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,007
I do not know what Lady Da-yeon said,

423
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,511
but it is dangerous to judge
after hearing only one side of the story.

424
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,805
Talking about something

425
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,349
you are not sure about
is even more dangerous.

426
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,894
You know Da-yeon would not
say something absurd.

427
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,273
You are so annoying!

428
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,616
I think he still has nightmares.

429
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,623
Does it mean
he will regain his memory soon?

430
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,377
Or is it because he has a problem
with his head?

431
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,632
We had better have him go to Jeonju
as soon as possible.

432
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,637
Gyeon U certainly is a good son,

433
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,558
but I do not think he would listen to us
as he is no longer a child.

434
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,394
If he keeps on being so stubborn,

435
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:42,148
I will ask the King to dismiss him.

436
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,986
Would you go that far?

437
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,698
Is there

438
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,368
anything else that I do not know?

439
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,038
I mean

440
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,125
anything other than Gyeon U's condition.

441
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,253
No, there is not such a thing.

442
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,376
You don't look

443
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,712
well.

444
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,591
How did you find me?

445
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,136
Do not be so stiff.

446
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:58,307
Don't you know
how dangerous it is to meet me?

447
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,559
I do.

448
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,607
You are still the only one
who cares about me.

449
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,763
Dan-yeong.

450
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,730
I passed the examination.

451
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,276
Congratulations.

452
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,530
Did something happen to you?

453
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,158
What is the matter?

454
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,290
Where did you get this silk from
out of the blue?

455
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,584
It is mine.

456
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,797
I do not want
to struggle in poverty anymore.

457
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,758
I will work as a royal guard soon.

458
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,303
If you marry me, I promise you--

459
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,637
But your salary

460
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,390
would be too small.

461
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,521
-If I work hard, things will get--
-I recently found out...

462
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,525
that one of my relatives
is a commander of the military.

463
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,819
He is one of the Jeong's family.
You know them.

464
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,488
It is Jeong Gi-jun.

465
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,242
He is a power elite.

466
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,745
So what?

467
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,292
-I asked to send me to the palace.
-Dan-yeong.

468
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,878
The one who will be my husband
will become the king of the nation,

469
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,505
not a minor government officer.

470
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,863
It has been a long time.

471
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:06,245
What brought you here, Your Highness?

472
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,207
I have a favor to ask.

473
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,921
I heard that you are close
with Prince Chuseong.

474
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,132
Please just get to the point.

475
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,508
I need you to cut off his head.

476
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,429
And please work for Commander Jeong.

477
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,767
You can do that for me, right?

478
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,646
Why

479
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,940
do I have to do that?

480
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,651
It is because I asked you.

481
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,413
I have a question.

482
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,334
What on earth...

483
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,464
is Councilor Jeong up to?

484
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,631
What do you mean by that?

485
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,301
I am asking
if Councilor Jeong is about to betray me.

486
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,389
Why are you silent?

487
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,395
Wol-myeong.

488
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,482
You are on my side, right?

489
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,203
I am no longer on your side,
Your Highness.

490
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,000
He is...

491
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,339
no longer on my side?

492
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,576
THE SECOND STATE COUNCILOR JEONG
IS ABOVE THE KING

493
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,246
"The Second State Councilor Jeong
is above the King"?

494
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:16,458
"How could Councilor Jeong reign
over the King?"

495
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,795
"Blinded by power is

496
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,339
Councilor Jeong"?

497
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,427
"The incompetent King turned

498
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:30,264
a blind eye to such evil deeds."

499
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,642
"They are the main culprits
that destroy Joseon."

500
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,687
"Finally, I will punish you
for your sins."

501
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,991
What kind of a jerk did such a thing?

502
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,787
According to the royal guards
who were on watch last night,

503
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,959
the one who spread the jirashis
was wearing a mask.

504
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,545
A mask?

505
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,755
Yes.

506
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,641
As the guy is darting in and out of places

507
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,059
and wearing a mask,

508
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,894
people call him...

509
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,814
Ghost Mask.

510
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,611
"Ghost Mask"?

511
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,238
The jirashis are different this time.

512
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,074
From the handwriting to the type of paper.

513
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,412
This guy does not seem to be one of them.

514
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,541
Then...

515
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,879
who do you think he would be?

516
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,932
Was the dried persimmon effective? Was it?

517
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,812
It did not work?

518
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,066
-I had a sound sleep.
-Really?

519
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,362
You look strange.

520
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,365
Master Gyeon,
you are hiding something from me.

521
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,658
How did you know that?

522
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,826
It is women's instinct.

523
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,790
Is it also something
I am not supposed to know?

524
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,677
This is a jirashi
that contains recent rumors.

525
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,472
THE SECOND STATE COUNCILOR JEONG
IS ABOVE THE KING

526
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,393
HOW COULD COUNCILOR JEONG
REIGN OVER THE KING?

527
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,478
THE INCOMPETENT KING
TURNED A BLIND EYE TO SUCH EVIL DEEDS

528
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,481
I do not think

529
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,818
it is Councilor Jeong who distributed it.

530
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,545
Your Highness.

531
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,176
Lieutenant Gang.

532
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,555
From today, I will accompany you
to the Bureau of Medical Services.

533
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,141
I have Byeol.
I do not need more bodyguards.

534
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,810
Because of Ghost Mask
who distributed the jirashis,

535
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,645
there is a stir in the capital.

536
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,690
Please bear with the inconvenience
and let us guard you.

537
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,866
Hey.

538
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,536
-Have you seen the new jirashi?
-Of course, we have.

539
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,538
It is so dreadful.

540
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,583
It criticizes Councilor Jeong and the King
at the same time.

541
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,627
It is rather satisfying than dreadful.

542
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,339
The guy who gives out the jirashis
haunts like ghosts and wears a mask.

543
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,008
So he is called Ghost Mask.

544
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,763
I heard he wears the mask
to cover his burn scar.

545
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,306
Burn scar?

546
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,349
Ghost Mask is

547
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,977
Prince Chuseong.

548
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,229
Prince Chuseong?

549
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,732
You know what happened ten years ago.

550
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,111
Ten years ago, Prince Chuseong...

551
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,282
Your Highness, you have...

552
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,788
-Your Highness.
-Prince Chuseong.

553
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,958
I will go back to the palace now.

554
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,919
Pardon? This early?

555
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,090
The rumor that Prince Chuseong
is the Ghost Mask

556
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,635
is widespread throughout the capital.

557
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,221
It cannot be Prince Chuseong.

558
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,681
Someone must be impersonating him.

559
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,643
What on earth would his purpose be?

560
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,271
What does he seek to obtain through this?

561
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,066
I do not know what he wants,

562
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,027
but he is certainly dangerous.

563
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,622
Prince Chuseong?

564
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,292
You know the one
who plotted treason ten years ago.

565
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,710
Treason?

566
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,171
Wait.

567
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,049
You do not remember it?

568
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,305
Gyeon U was staying in his grandfather's
house in Jeonju at that time, right?

569
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,933
Was he? I am not sure.

570
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,436
So Prince Chuseong

571
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,647
committed treason ten years ago?

572
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,857
Yes.

573
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,112
He jumped into the fire,
so everyone thought he was dead.

574
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,907
But he returned with the mask
to take revenge.

575
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,285
Take revenge on who?

576
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,414
Mal-geum told me

577
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,291
that Ghost Mask threw

578
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:52,377
a knife at Councilor Jeong a few days ago.

579
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,796
He also appeared

580
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,008
in the houses
of other officials of Royal Court.

581
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,304
It is frightening. I am scared.

582
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,149
Be on your guard.

583
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,692
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

584
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,238
Let us go.

585
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,254
Minister of Administration
would be the last one.

586
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,300
The scum called Ghost Mask

587
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,429
will turn up in the house
of Minister of Administration soon.

588
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,308
Do you think
Prince Chuseong really came back alive?

589
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,896
I just heard people saying it.

590
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,065
He is dead.

591
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,068
You saw him jumping into the fire too.

592
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,819
My apologies.

593
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,865
Stop such nonsense and strengthen
the guard around your house.

594
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,951
There is no need to do so.

595
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,245
Lower the security
and withdraw the guards.

596
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,748
What do you mean by that?

597
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,292
He is our prey.

598
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,088
He must not notice that we are on a hunt.

599
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,370
Lower your guard tonight.

600
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,913
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

601
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,074
Your Highness, where are you rushing to?

602
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,539
Your Majesty, please hurry.

603
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,251
We have found evidence for treason.

604
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,963
He said
that the evidence of treason was found

605
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,884
on the day my mother was dethroned.

606
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:51,014
Does that mean there is something
between Prince Chuseong

607
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,933
and the Queen?

608
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:55,935
Maybe.

609
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,815
Your Highness,
tell us where you are going.

610
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,443
To the only one
who can answer the question.

611
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,411
-Tell her that I am here.
-Yes, Your Highness.

612
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,583
Your Highness,
the Princess is here to visit you.

613
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,055
What brings you here at this late hour?

614
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,182
I have a question to ask.

615
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,476
You have something to ask?

616
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,315
Have you seen the new jirashis
strewn in the capital?

617
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,984
Is that why you came here?

618
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,278
You want to know
if I have seen the jirashi or not?

619
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,073
I want to know who distributed the flyers.

620
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,952
You speak as if I knew who did it.

621
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,329
I want to know...

622
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:59,290
about Prince Chuseong.

623
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,594
You will regret it.

624
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,304
It is okay.

625
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,933
It might break your heart.

626
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,478
That is why I came to you.

627
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,440
You do not care

628
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,609
about my feelings.

629
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,530
You are such a daring girl.

630
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,159
You do

631
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,953
take after your mother.

632
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,122
The apple never falls far from the tree.

633
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,376
Prince Chuseong...

634
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,174
committed adultery
with your mother who was expelled.

635
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,927
Also, he plotted a rebellion
to conceal the relationship.

636
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,512
But he got caught and died.

637
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,474
That is why your mother was dethroned.

638
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,603
That is the truth
that no one has told you...

639
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,273
until today.

640
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,211
The Ghost Mask is here!

641
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:36,447
He knows about the evil deeds
of Councilor Jeong.

642
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,700
What did she find out?

643
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,370
What you heard from Court Lady An
was about Prince Chuseong, right?

644
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,707
He is hiding the fact
that the Ghost Mask visited his house?

645
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,334
You must capture him alive.

646
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,462
"The adultery scandal broken ten years ago

647
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,256
is a total lie."

648
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:56,926
Those who framed my mother will pay
the price for what they have done.

649
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,553
Are you suspecting me now?

650
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,514
Catch the Ghost Mask.
I need to see who is behind the mask.

651
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,433
Master Gyeon!

652
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,233
