1
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,623
We still have a long way to go.

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,167
Will you continue walking?

3
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,921
When will I ever get the chance
to walk outside the palace

4
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,090
so leisurely like this?

5
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,220
That is why I suggested that
you should come out more often.

6
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,810
Every time I decide to make
a trip far away, it troubles our people.

7
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,314
How could I dare to easily take
such a trip like this?

8
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,830
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,916
-Protect His Majesty!
-Yes, sir!

10
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,920
Hurry up.

11
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,967
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

12
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:56,282
"The King will cry bitterly
after losing his child."

13
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,046
I said I will tell you if you let me go.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,798
Can't you understand what's going on?

15
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,300
You must be the one who doesn't
understand what's going on.

16
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,719
I guess you do not need your ledger.

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,388
You little...

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,975
Would you like a few scars

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,853
on that pretty face of yours?

20
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,647
Put that down.

21
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,284
My goodness.

22
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,828
I am seeing a lot of familiar faces today.

23
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,913
Master Gyeon.

24
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,084
Guys, you should welcome our guest.

25
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,420
Move.

26
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,971
What are you doing, you punks?

27
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,399
What the hell?

28
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,661
Master Gyeon!

29
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,587
Master Gyeon...

30
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,929
You should have brought
a more useful weapon.

31
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,181
That fan of yours is
not enough to confront us.

32
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,066
What was that?

33
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,317
Gosh.

34
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,319
Who is that?

35
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,120
-What?
-Hey, go!

36
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,944
Let us go.

37
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,364
What? They are running away!

38
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,366
Get them!

39
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
Are you all right?

40
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,634
Why are you making that strange face?

41
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,054
Guktaeminan.

42
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,224
I was praying for

43
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,018
the wellness of the country and subjects.

44
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,979
What? "Guktaeminan"?

45
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,481
Don't you know you should make a wish
when the lanterns fly?

46
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,526
Is my face the lantern?

47
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,990
By the way,

48
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,451
why aren't you wearing shoes?

49
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,371
What? Where did they go?

50
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,999
Well...

51
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,103
Who ordered you to do this?

52
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,730
I told you many times.

53
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,485
I only wanted to find
my stolen ledger back.

54
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,043
I would've been okay wearing your shoes.

55
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
Then I would have had no shoes to wear.

56
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,467
It was more comfortable
than I expected though.

57
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,137
You can return those flowery shoes then.

58
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,181
You gave this to me already.
Don't be so cheap.

59
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,308
Master Gyeon.

60
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,065
The King is going back to the palace.

61
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,470
Hurry up.

62
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,227
Excuse me. Let me through.

63
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,239
Your Majesty.

64
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,200
Why are you back so early?

65
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,708
Your Majesty.

66
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,632
The King has turned so pale.

67
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,906
Father.

68
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,619
The Princess.

69
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,579
Where is she?

70
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,513
Your Majesty.

71
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,767
-Is she inside?
-Pardon?

72
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
That is...

73
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,482
Gosh.

74
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,202
Father.

75
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,746
Has everything been well today?

76
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,499
Yes, Father.

77
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,586
It is fine then.

78
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,380
Get some rest.

79
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,685
Gosh, it is so hot.

80
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,980
So hot.

81
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,573
Princess.

82
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,909
Are you sure everything is all right?

83
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,703
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,352
Master Gyeon!

85
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,187
Yes, here!

86
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,651
How did it go?

87
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,864
Master Gyeon...

88
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,450
Was she caught?

89
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,952
His Majesty

90
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,622
wants to see you.

91
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,293
Me?

92
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,427
Father.

93
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,846
Look at your pitiful face.

94
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,899
My apologies.

95
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,694
Sorry!

96
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,615
Is it fun to tease me?

97
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,618
You get scared too easily for a man.

98
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,953
Anyway,

99
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,498
I am glad this went well.

100
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,515
What is this?

101
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,809
Well... Use this medicine
however you want.

102
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,063
Well, then. Bye.

103
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,778
Your Highness.

104
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,875
What are you doing?

105
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,919
Do not sneak outside
the palace from now on.

106
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,505
Please behave like a princess.

107
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,715
-Give it to me right now.
-Manners.

108
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,802
Don't be so impolite to me,

109
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,931
and treat me as the Prince's teacher.

110
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,433
I will give this back to you
if you promise.

111
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,896
Then I shall forget everything about

112
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,066
how sassy you behaved outside the palace.

113
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,659
Sure, I promise.

114
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,620
If that is what you want.

115
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,834
Please give my jade ring back.

116
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,005
Please keep it well.

117
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,092
Do not lose it again.

118
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,554
Gosh!

119
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,683
While you are at it,

120
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,437
forget about that too.

121
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:01,025
Then this sassy Princess
will leave you now.

122
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,511
My apologies.

123
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,725
THE KING WILL CRY
AFTER LOSING HIS CHILD

124
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,270
I guess this was done by those
who made the jirashis.

125
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,862
Do you have any idea who they might be?

126
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,502
No one ordered me to do such a thing!

127
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,005
I just did it because of my ledger!

128
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,715
Nothing else!

129
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,472
Don't stop until he tells the truth.

130
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,598
Yes, sir.

131
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,744
I am glad that you found it.

132
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,248
Did you thank Master Gyeon?

133
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,167
He's the one who lost it.
It's only fair that he finds it.

134
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,962
Still, you should admit that
he went through a lot.

135
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,547
He must have suffered

136
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,966
from all the physical
and emotional suppression.

137
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,052
What? By whom?

138
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,596
To be honest, you lost--

139
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,310
I will leave you now. Goodnight.

140
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,938
Goodness.

141
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,736
So why behave so arrogantly?

142
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,865
Put that down.

143
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,258
Master Gyeon!

144
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,013
He injured his arm...
Maybe I shouldn't have kicked his leg.

145
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,098
Whatever.

146
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,687
How did it go?

147
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,230
Are you hurt?

148
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,107
Don't tell anything about this to Mother.

149
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,650
What about that sassy girl?

150
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
She's perfectly fine.

151
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,990
By the way,

152
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,201
why were you in that spooky place?

153
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,327
What?

154
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,872
Just...

155
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,752
I am getting sleepy now. Goodnight!

156
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,098
She should thank me

157
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,266
if I give her sincere advice.

158
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,852
She kicks me all the time.

159
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,938
Does she think she is
a bully or something?

160
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,904
I even shed blood because of her.

161
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,949
I really should not face her again.

162
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,137
Gosh.

163
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,098
She's carrying fire in one hand
and water in the other.

164
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,869
Please keep this safe with you.

165
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,790
I shall return no matter what.

166
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,992
These jirashis have created lies,

167
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,036
made a fool out of the Royal Family,

168
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,789
and deceived me, the King.

169
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,458
Those jirashis are only rumors.

170
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,421
The Princess and the Prince are safe.

171
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,175
Please do not worry anymore, Your Majesty.

172
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,304
They were fully aware of your move.

173
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:09,309
Perhaps, there are spies
within the palace.

174
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,019
"Spies"?

175
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,854
There is no way.

176
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,898
How can you be so sure?

177
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,527
There might be spies right here.

178
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,989
That is absurd, Chief Scholar Gyeon.

179
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,200
That's nonsense.

180
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
Chief Scholar Gyeon is right.

181
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,174
It is possible

182
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,261
that spies sneaked into the palace.

183
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,597
We shall investigate this thoroughly.

184
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,434
If it is true, we shall put an end to it.

185
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,485
What's your plan?

186
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,282
It is only natural the water
flows through its way.

187
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,159
If it becomes a puddle,

188
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,370
we just have to make a new way.

189
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,873
A new way?

190
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,529
THE BUTCHER'S

191
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,978
Which family are you from?

192
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,483
Why? Are you thinking about abusing
your family's power over mine?

193
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,945
You seem to have experience in
abusing your power.

194
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,245
I have searched everywhere
with the others.

195
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,541
There is no such girl in the capital.

196
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,213
Are you saying that she
fell from the sky or something?

197
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,225
Lady Da-yeon.

198
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,982
What brings you here?

199
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,401
I have a favor to ask you.

200
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,114
I will do whatever you ask.

201
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,576
There is a crazy and obsessive woman

202
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,578
clinging to Master Gyeon these days.

203
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,123
I would like you to find out
about that girl.

204
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,545
Do you think I have time
to do such things?

205
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,382
I know it's your duty to
prevent disorderly conduct.

206
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,218
That is right.

207
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,306
It is the first favor I ask of you.

208
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,185
I would be disappointed if you reject.

209
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,067
That Gyeon U!

210
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,286
What happened to his trace?

211
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,079
-We are looking for it.
-Indeed.

212
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,624
-We are working hard on it.
-With our eyes wide open.

213
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,751
Then why are you here?

214
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,377
Go and search!

215
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,087
Let us go.

216
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,214
Wait.

217
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,509
Find out about the crazy
and obsessive woman too.

218
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,221
The crazy and obsessive woman? But...

219
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,348
Never mind.

220
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,100
What? Say it.

221
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,770
Does he have a girlfriend?

222
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,024
Just find the crazy girl.

223
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,984
The girl clinging to Gyeon U!

224
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,737
-I see.
-I see. The crazy girl.

225
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,157
Seeing that Lady Da-yeon
is looking for that girl

226
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,283
she must certainly be

227
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,285
interested in Gyeon U.

228
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,370
Of course.

229
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,040
She wouldn't look for such girl
if she had no interest in him.

230
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,085
-Right.
-I see.

231
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,505
Stop talking nonsense and find her.

232
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,674
See you later.

233
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,733
It seems like it's right in front of me.

234
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,285
What are you doing here?

235
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,662
Go back to your places.

236
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,081
It enables you to see things
far away from you.

237
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,624
It is called a telescope.

238
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,670
I think my sister will like this
very much.

239
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,714
I see.

240
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,718
By the way, I do not see her around today.

241
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,347
We can finally focus on our studies.

242
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,434
Studying with her is fun though.

243
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,145
Your Highness.

244
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,648
If you're done using the telescope,
please take out your homework.

245
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,696
Master, I am not done
using this telescope yet.

246
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,659
There is my sister.

247
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,291
She is with Lieutenant Gang.

248
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,090
There you go. You look serious again.

249
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,385
I just got involved
with some scoundrels by accident.

250
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,304
I will be careful from now on--

251
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,765
Never go outside the palace again.

252
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,266
If you do,

253
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,935
I shall report this
to the King immediately.

254
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,813
Why are you being like this?
You're scaring me.

255
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
Please

256
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,734
be careful.

257
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,865
Lieutenant Gang.

258
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,533
Goodness.

259
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,331
What were they talking about?

260
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,930
Let us begin with our class.

261
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,266
Well...

262
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,728
According to Confucius,

263
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,688
you never earn anything

264
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,315
if you do not think after your lesson.

265
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,484
He also said if you think
only without learning,

266
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,236
it will be too risky.

267
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,447
Hyemyeong.

268
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,787
You are here, Your Highness.

269
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,214
Master Gyeon.

270
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,467
Why did you steal a glance at me?

271
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,220
What do you mean?

272
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,723
I was admiring the dragon head decoration

273
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,183
on the pavilion made by a craftsman.

274
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,186
Master Gyeon, the pavilion
is on the other side.

275
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,313
I was mistaken then.

276
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,485
Master Gyeon, are you interested in me?

277
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,779
Excuse me?

278
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,365
Master Gyeon! Is that true?

279
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,369
It is all right, so be honest.

280
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,663
Don't be shy because the Prince is here.

281
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,374
I don't understand
what you are trying to say.

282
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,627
It is not a crime to be drawn
to a beautiful woman.

283
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,547
I fully understand.

284
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,805
But wake up.

285
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,724
Even if someone offers me
a huge amount of gold

286
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,685
to be with a sly person like you,
I would still refuse.

287
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,345
I cannot stand this anymore.

288
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,769
Your Majesty, Master Gyeon
is here to see you.

289
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:23,655
Did you go outside the palace again?

290
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,454
You do not deserve to be a princess.

291
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,956
Guards!

292
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,500
Dethrone the Princess...

293
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,043
and lock her inside the chest.

294
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,045
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,797
Father!

296
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,049
Father!

297
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,468
Let go!

298
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:49,472
Father, I have something to say.

299
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,394
Please lock Master Gyeon up with me.

300
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,606
It was Master Gyeon

301
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,568
who talked me into going to the festival.

302
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,821
What?

303
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,417
Your Majesty, I am innocent!

304
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,419
-Please save me.
-Come here.

305
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,005
-Please!
-I will not be lonely in here.

306
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,465
Your Majesty!

307
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,887
No way.

308
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,101
What would be a good way
to tame that wild Princess?

309
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,869
Where did everyone go?

310
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,508
Your Highness,
the Queen is looking for you.

311
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,473
Why are you doing this? Why...

312
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,684
You should greet your mother first--

313
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,978
I asked you why you are doing this.

314
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,064
Do you really not know?

315
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,526
They have done nothing wrong.

316
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,861
They did not serve their master right.

317
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,239
They did wrong enough.

318
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,953
Just punish me instead.

319
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,834
How can I?

320
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,587
Continue hitting them.

321
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,300
Stop.

322
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,596
What are you doing?

323
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,181
I said to punish them!

324
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,781
What are you doing?

325
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,037
Hit me instead.

326
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,664
Do you think I won't do it?

327
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,849
What is going on?

328
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,867
The Princess went outside the palace?

329
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:41,037
I went to talk to her yesterday,

330
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,164
but she wasn't in her residence all day.

331
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,251
She could have been
in somewhere else inside the palace.

332
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,920
This is not all.

333
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,005
Even when His Majesty
returned to the palace,

334
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,592
she was sitting in her room
sweating profusely with dirt on her feet.

335
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,010
I am certain.

336
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,768
Seeing her acting innocent
after deceiving her father,

337
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,728
I was very upset.

338
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,648
My apologies.

339
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,946
How should I deal with it?

340
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,366
-We should let His Majesty know--
-Let it slide.

341
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,785
Pardon? But...

342
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:25,248
The King is under a lot of stress already.

343
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:29,710
There is nothing good
about letting him know of this.

344
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,671
Of course,

345
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,716
I do not want him to worry.

346
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,343
Alright then.

347
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:42,098
Be generous and let it slide this time.

348
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:46,769
You gave her a lesson today as well.

349
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,272
She must be repenting now.

350
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,838
Your Highness,

351
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,674
don't be so upset.

352
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,429
I am sorry. It is all because of me.

353
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,890
We are really fine.

354
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,308
Right, Byeol?

355
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,394
Right, we are fine.

356
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,323
There is nothing to be upset about.

357
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,454
-Yeong-sin.
-Yes, Your Highness.

358
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,166
-It is not enough.
-Pardon?

359
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,796
The bandage is too short for you.

360
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,216
You need to lose some fat on your legs.

361
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,178
What do you mean?
It's swollen because of the beating!

362
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,097
If you say so.

363
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,058
I'm telling you the truth!

364
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,810
Stay still.

365
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,188
You are such a crybaby.

366
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,026
How come there are so few books?

367
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,487
Did all the writers slack off?

368
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,073
Goodness.

369
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,328
Seriously.

370
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,334
Master Gyeon.

371
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,963
This is the most popular book these days.

372
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,257
THE PRINCESS' PRIVATE LIFE

373
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,592
"The Princess' Private Life"?

374
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,012
It is amazing.

375
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,516
I am not looking for things like this.

376
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,185
It is all right to be honest between men.

377
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,229
There is nothing to be ashamed.

378
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,982
You are a man, so naturally--

379
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,234
I said I am not looking
for something like this.

380
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,154
Then what is it that you want?

381
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,032
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW

382
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,451
Something about revenge and punishment.

383
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,288
I want everything about taking revenge.

384
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,416
Something about taming girls too.

385
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,839
Master Gyeon.

386
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,550
"A Way to Tame a Girl."

387
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,886
-"Kill Your Wife."
-That is right.

388
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,347
"Vengeance Is Mine".

389
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,518
"The Taming of the Shrew."
This one is a masterpiece.

390
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,104
-Do you need more?
-Yes, please get me more.

391
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,778
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW

392
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,366
Gosh.

393
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,744
THE TAMING OF THE SHREW

394
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,162
VENGEANCE IS MINE

395
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,332
These are all ridiculous.

396
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,418
I will not be able to tame
the Princess like this.

397
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,017
THE PRINCESS' PRIVATE LIFE

398
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,518
Why is this...

399
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,814
Why is this here?

400
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,986
The cover is really...

401
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,170
Your Highness.

402
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,635
You are cute.

403
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,931
Do not even think about
going home tonight.

404
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,558
-You shouldn't do this.
-Yes, I should.

405
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,936
I am not prepared yet.

406
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,938
-Yes, you are.
-Your Highness.

407
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,482
Just stay still. I will do everything.

408
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,651
Just trust me.

409
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,653
Your Highness.

410
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,244
Right.

411
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,497
Like it says in The Art of War,

412
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,668
the best option is to
avoid troubles like this.

413
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,055
Is it not Master Gyeon?

414
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,269
Is he

415
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,188
running away from me now?

416
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,357
I think so.

417
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,318
Master Gyeon!

418
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,238
Master Gyeon!

419
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,074
Master Gyeon!

420
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,498
Are these warts on her face?

421
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,417
KIM EUN-JI, 18 YEARS OLD

422
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,294
She is from a rich family.

423
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,171
That is good.

424
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,173
That would be perfect.

425
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,426
Her father is the Minister
of Culture and Education?

426
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,303
She is in.

427
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,637
A blind date?

428
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:19,268
This is the list of girls who
want to get married to you.

429
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,521
Mother, I am not interested
in getting married yet.

430
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,064
Do not worry.

431
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,525
I do not have any intention of

432
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,652
marrying off my son this early.

433
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,113
What? Then why...

434
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,032
I did not tell you to marry someone.

435
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,993
Meet with these girls but
do not agree on marrying them.

436
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,286
Do not reject them either.

437
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:40,247
Just keep these girls interested in you.

438
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,501
I do not get what you are saying.

439
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,586
It is simple.

440
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,630
She wants to brag about
her outstanding son

441
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,257
to the other families.

442
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,427
In other words, keep them on the hook.

443
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,264
Son.

444
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,768
Can you not grant your mother's wish

445
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,270
and be a good son?

446
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,730
Gyeon U.

447
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,192
Mother, I cannot meet all of them.

448
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,153
Just make them take turns in meeting you.

449
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,114
Let me put them in order.

450
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,283
The one from a rich family
would be first to meet.

451
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,244
She is the first in line.

452
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,818
Master Gyeon?

453
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,579
THIRD DAUGHTER OF THE MINISTER
OF CULTURE AND EDUCATION

454
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,332
Lady Choi?

455
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,419
It is nice to meet you.

456
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,798
You look very different from the picture.

457
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,217
I meant a little.

458
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,468
Right?

459
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,263
I look better in person, right?

460
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,556
Yes.

461
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,267
This picture is totally wrong.

462
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,686
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.

463
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,689
Are you disappointed?

464
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,738
She is warm, modest, and elegant.

465
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,198
She is graceful

466
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,827
and looks like a warm sunlight
in the afternoon.

467
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,664
She is your ideal type.

468
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,227
She is the only daughter.

469
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,396
The family's inheritance
will all go to her husband.

470
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,231
What are you waiting for?

471
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,359
She is perfect for you.

472
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,363
Look at this pretty ring.

473
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,785
Shall I buy you a white horse?

474
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,627
This is driving me crazy.

475
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,183
The fortune says she likes men.

476
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,270
She looks sly which is perfect for you.

477
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,738
My goodness.

478
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,908
I know how to read fortunes
by looking at people's palms.

479
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,910
If you do not mind, may I?

480
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,620
I will read your fortunes.

481
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,831
My goodness.

482
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,958
Goodness gracious.

483
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,378
You are very healthy.

484
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,965
Your hand is so...

485
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,808
Think of her as your mother
and depend on her.

486
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,653
I hear you are the Prince's teacher.

487
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,698
How much is your income?

488
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,534
She must be good at managing the houshold.

489
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,663
She asks how much you earn
right off the bat. She is one of a kind.

490
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,545
Stop already.

491
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,339
Did you say that to me?

492
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,468
Oh, not you.

493
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,556
I heard Master Gyeon is having
blind dates every day.

494
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,684
You wanted Da-yeon to be your in-law.

495
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,561
Have you given up on that?

496
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,023
It is nothing. They are all
meeting him for nothing.

497
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,441
What do you mean?

498
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,736
He is meeting those girls
for his mother's sake.

499
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,740
Those whom Mother wants to make her
daughter-in-law are not on the list.

500
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,911
My brother is only meeting them
to make his mother happy.

501
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,705
But he has the sassy girl.

502
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,377
Are you sure the girl is clinging to him?

503
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,920
Are they really not lovers?

504
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,590
That is nonsense!

505
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,597
-How dare you!
-My apologies.

506
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,848
I am sorry.

507
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,768
Be careful.

508
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,825
If you continue to cry,

509
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,785
I will just make you live with me.

510
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,787
Let us stop and eat something.

511
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,956
Stop the horse.

512
00:47:56,873 --> 00:48:00,043
Will you eat or kiss me?

513
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,381
Stop! Please stop the horse.

514
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,050
Will you eat or sleep with me?

515
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,345
He came for drinks.

516
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,891
Hey, Gyeon U. How was your blind date?

517
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,602
How was it?

518
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,104
Let us stop here.

519
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,484
-Gosh, you stink.
-Stop.

520
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:36,872
So the image of her keeps
showing in front of you.

521
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:41,710
Right, and she is like the enemy
whom I do not wish to see again.

522
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:46,465
That must be because of your
eagerness to take revenge.

523
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,925
Right, that must be it.

524
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,136
The eagerness to take revenge.
Feeling suppressed.

525
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,184
By the way,

526
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,854
how is your relationship
with Lady Hyemyeong?

527
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,399
There is no relationship between us.

528
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,694
He has been talking
about her ever since the festival.

529
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,904
You fool.

530
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,699
If you are not interested,

531
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,993
introduce her to me.

532
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,663
She is not someone you can handle.

533
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,915
That is her charm.

534
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:23,168
She's not confined to the rules.
She goes ahead of time.

535
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,836
She is my ideal type.

536
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,713
Charm? Ideal type?

537
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,050
Write one more novel
if you have time to long for her.

538
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,678
Dating her will eventually
make me do well on my work.

539
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,137
Come on.

540
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,598
You have no pride.

541
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,766
Goodness.

542
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,893
It is love that we are talking about.

543
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:43,146
Stop treating my love so lowly like that.

544
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,941
-Do not hit me.
-That is enough.

545
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,943
Give up on that woman.

546
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,449
Do you like her by any chance?

547
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,202
The girl that you keep
thinking about is...

548
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,710
That is ridiculous!

549
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,255
It is more suspicious
to see you react this way.

550
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,798
Right.

551
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,719
Stop being so stubborn
and introduce her to me.

552
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,264
To me.

553
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,693
Who is that?

554
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,237
-Get him!
-Yes, sir!

555
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,866
Stop!

556
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,251
Stop!

557
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,670
Over there!

558
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,013
-Get them!
-Stop!

559
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,643
-Get them!
-Stop!

560
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,145
Get them.

561
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,647
Stop there.

562
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,249
-Arrest them all.
-Yes, sir.

563
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,297
From here is the Gentry Village.

564
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,927
You cannot enter without
the King's orders.

565
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,274
Gentry Village

566
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:36,111
Do you understand?

567
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,160
Did anyone follow you?

568
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,328
-No, my lady.
-No, my lady.

569
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,341
You must not let others know of this.

570
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,214
Take a look.

571
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,061
Eagerness to take revenge.

572
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,480
Feeling suppressed.

573
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,485
Right, that must be it.

574
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,825
Hey.

575
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,745
We must be meant to be.

576
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,414
I see you wherever I go.

577
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,171
Is it not that you followed me?

578
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,300
We got caught, my lord.

579
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,177
Maybe we made it too obvious.

580
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,182
Is it a new jirashi?

581
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:34,312
We just found this on the ground.

582
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,398
Well,

583
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:41,111
it says the Princess came
to the lantern festival.

584
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,783
Why are you so surprised?

585
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,331
It is surprising news.

586
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,167
It is too early to be surprised.

587
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,548
It also says she enjoyed
the night with a man.

588
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,383
That man is...

589
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,932
Gang Jun-yeong, the lieutenant
of Office of Investigation.

590
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,934
You remember Do-chi, right?

591
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,270
The leader of a gang.

592
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,815
It turns out the three of them
are in a love triangle.

593
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,151
-What?
-Gang Jun-yeong

594
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,529
finds out that the Princess
is dating Do-chi.

595
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,408
Thus, he arrested Do-chi
and locked him up in prison.

596
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,537
That is not true.

597
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,415
How do you know if it's true or not?

598
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,172
I heard from a friend

599
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,091
of a friend of my friend.

600
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,345
I heard from a friend of a friend
of my friend too.

601
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,893
Did you not say she has a lover already?

602
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,020
I heard that is why she keeps
sneaking out of the palace.

603
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,980
That royal commissioner?

604
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:03,359
Now that it has been three years,
it is time that she got over him.

605
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,946
The Princess' lover?

606
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,492
I only read it in the jirashi.

607
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,452
The guy's name is Min Yu-hwan.

608
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,496
He went missing three years ago

609
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,915
while investigating something in secret.

610
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,625
He went missing?

611
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,044
Yes, it is because

612
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,963
he got caught taking bribes.

613
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,217
He must still be on the wanted list.

614
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,708
Let me see that.

615
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,388
LIEUTENANT GANG, THE PRINCESS
AND DO-CHI ARE IN A LOVE TRIANGLE

616
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,364
The Princess, Lieutenant Gang,
and the leader of a gang?

617
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,200
This is exciting.

618
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:39,289
The King's trustworthy
Lieutenant Gang is on the flyer too,

619
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:43,668
so he will not let it pass this time.

620
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,177
Is this true?

621
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,223
Tell me this instant if
you are hiding anything from me.

622
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,392
My apologies, Your Majesty.

623
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,522
What should we do?

624
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,649
It is all over the palace now.

625
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,985
If His Majesty finds this out...

626
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,529
-Do not make a fuss.
-I am not just saying this.

627
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,032
I am worried.

628
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,661
His Majesty is here.

629
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,337
Why did you go outside?

630
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,466
For what reason?

631
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,945
Did you not say she has a lover already?

632
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,072
I heard that is why she keeps
sneaking out of the palace.

633
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,009
You deceived the King and broke the rules.

634
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,095
I cannot let you loose anymore.

635
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,429
She's grounded in her residence?

636
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,599
Being locked up is not enough.
She needs to be stopped for good.

637
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,601
Who is behind all this?

638
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,520
I will return at night.

639
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,313
Why are you so reckless?

640
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,148
Can't you pretend that you didn't see me?

641
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,484
It is all because of her lover.

642
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,654
Please keep this safe with you.
I shall return no matter what.

643
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,074
The longing heart for something.

644
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,119
That is the scariest of all.

645
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,748
Who are you?

646
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,919
