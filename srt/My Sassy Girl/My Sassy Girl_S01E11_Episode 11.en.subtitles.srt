1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,546
There was a secret transaction
using my marriage?

2
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,298
It might have something to do
with the treason.

3
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,052
How dare...

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,766
You did a great job.

5
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,310
I will tell the King of Joseon
about your loyalty.

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,686
I did not do it out of such loyalty.

7
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,609
I did it for my own sake.

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,779
You did it for yourself?

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,968
Do you recognize

10
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,179
the handwriting?

11
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,811
I WANT TO KEEP YOU HERE
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,146
So, this is

13
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,315
the famous fan designed
to recruit talented people?

14
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,610
The Emperor gave me this as he wanted me

15
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,321
to stay there and work for Qing.

16
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,615
And...

17
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,578
the Emperor promised you
he would grant your wish

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,624
anytime you take out this fan, right?

19
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,336
Please give up on the royal marriage.

20
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,923
That is all I want.

21
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,107
Jerk.

22
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,864
Jerk!

23
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,743
"Jerk"?

24
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,039
What does that mean?

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,296
She is saying she feels great.

26
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,756
Jerk...

27
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,686
Miracles happen if you
desperately long for something.

28
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,416
I learned a lot from you.

29
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,879
I will not forget all the moments
I had with you.

30
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,006
I wish you happiness.

31
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,467
I will always pray for your happiness.

32
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,472
You look quite sad.

33
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,017
Of course. The prince is handsome.

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,311
Why don't you go to Qing with him then?

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,812
It is not too late.

36
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,023
Master Gyeon, are you upset?

37
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,859
What do you mean? That is totally absurd.

38
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,111
Come on. I know you are upset.

39
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,821
Please stop it.

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,033
I must have gone out of my mind.

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,037
How could I think this petty man
is better than the prince?

42
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,208
Pardon?

43
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,710
What did you just say?

44
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,755
-I know you heard it.
-I did not hear it clearly.

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,925
You are more handsome than him.

46
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,930
You are so beautiful.

47
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,932
Do you really think so?

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,272
They are so lovey-dovey together.

49
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,987
Who did you collude with?

50
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,739
Your charge is treason.

51
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,492
You cannot just take
the responsibility alone.

52
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,912
My lord.

53
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,293
You will never be able to get out of here

54
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,045
before you reveal everything.

55
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,130
If you ever...

56
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,925
think someone would let you free,

57
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,012
that is nothing but a vain hope.

58
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,809
Your Majesty, put the criminal
to death by dismemberment, please.

59
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,854
We have already secured evidence,

60
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,856
and he clearly has diabolical greed.

61
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,358
There is no reason to keep him
alive anymore.

62
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,195
Please behead him immediately
and make it an exemplary punishment.

63
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,742
Your Majesty, that is not right.

64
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,996
You cannot punish him
without a proper interrogation.

65
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,456
I agree.

66
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,043
A thorough investigation must precede.

67
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,548
Your Majesty, please question
the criminal yourself.

68
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,512
There may be accomplices.

69
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,473
Please interrogate him yourself

70
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,893
and eliminate all suspicions.

71
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,528
What do you think about it?

72
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,123
Answer me.

73
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,546
I believe it is a reasonable suggestion.

74
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:28,012
I will hold an official
investigation in three days.

75
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,890
I ask you all for your presence

76
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,977
and cooperation so that we can
get to the bottom of the case.

77
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,063
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,244
An official investigation?

79
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,956
What if Minister of Taxation
reveals everything?

80
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,209
Office of Investigation is on high alert.

81
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,796
Since the devoted retainers
of Lieutenant Gang are on guard,

82
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,798
it seems difficult to break in.

83
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,133
We have three days left.

84
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,927
Then get rid of him immediately.

85
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
You know what happens

86
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,391
when we fail to remove the rotten flesh.

87
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,311
I heard you played a major role in
the arresting of the minister.

88
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,980
Thank you.

89
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,023
It was my duty
as a scholar in this country

90
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,276
to serve the country
and rectify injustices.

91
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
I cannot take credit for my duties.

92
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,246
I will reward you.

93
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,290
Is there any position you want to take?

94
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,209
I did not do it for a reward.

95
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,462
Just tell me.

96
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,382
I really want to reward you.

97
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,269
You were reinstated
as the Prince's teacher?

98
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,438
What is the matter?

99
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,982
The King said you could take up
any position you wanted.

100
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,651
Why did you decide just
to be the Prince's teacher again?

101
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,570
What is wrong about being a teacher?

102
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,157
I am just saying that there are
many better posts than that.

103
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,827
I will be able to see you

104
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
more often and easily then.

105
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,962
Also, I believe the position to give
the right instructions to the Prince

106
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,131
who will govern the nation is

107
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,258
more important than any other job.

108
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,727
Why are you staring at me?

109
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,647
Because you are so lovely.

110
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,126
Your Highness.

111
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,672
Your Highness.

112
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,135
-Your Highness!
-You scared me.

113
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,595
Do you have a death wish?

114
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,014
I called you so many times.

115
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,892
You were so engrossed in thinking about
Master Gyeon that you didn't hear me.

116
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,227
How do you know

117
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,438
if I was thinking about
Master Gyeon or not?

118
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,649
It is obvious. You were smirking

119
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,068
with flushed cheeks.

120
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,195
Do you think we are that slow-witted?

121
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,288
Did I really look like that?

122
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,255
Do you like him that much?

123
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,092
Do not ask! I do not know.

124
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,595
Stop looking at me.

125
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,308
My lady,

126
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,523
please wait here.

127
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
My lord...

128
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,710
What happened?

129
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
I asked you what happened.

130
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,506
She heard

131
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,593
that the Princess's marriage was
called off because of Master Gyeon...

132
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,604
By the way,

133
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,565
who requested a royal marriage

134
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,901
with the Princess?

135
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,780
Why do you ask?

136
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,241
It is just out of curiosity.

137
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,549
Resignation?

138
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,552
Why do you not look back at yourself

139
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,472
and devote to training young
scholars in Jeonju for a while?

140
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,517
Father, why...

141
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,102
When a tree grows taller,

142
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,813
it has to withstand more wind and rain.

143
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,357
Sometimes, it needs to find

144
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,195
and stand under the shade
rather than basking in the sun.

145
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,574
I understand how worried you are
but I cannot do that.

146
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,619
-Gyeon U.
-A tree that runs away from the wind

147
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,663
and rain out of fear
can never be a strong tree.

148
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,457
Please trust me and watch me.

149
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,811
Do as your father says.

150
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,563
Mother...

151
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,567
You have had bad dreams
and have lost weight recently.

152
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,611
Give him better invigorating tonics.
He does not have to resign.

153
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,822
What is the matter with you and Father?

154
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,491
-Be quiet.
-Am I wrong?

155
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,452
Working as the Prince's teacher is--

156
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,454
I said be quiet.

157
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,997
Mother...

158
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,626
Gyeon U,
I do not want you to be in danger.

159
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,630
I do not want you to get
along with the Princess either.

160
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,302
Please give a second thought
to his suggestion.

161
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,725
Do not go.

162
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,769
Do not.

163
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,812
Please do not leave.

164
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,731
Please.

165
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,523
Show me the other side too.

166
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,644
Your Highness!

167
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,692
What are you making a fuss over?

168
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,777
Queen Dowager wants you to come over.

169
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,113
Grandmother wants to see me?

170
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,957
You look well now.

171
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,423
I know it must have been painful for you.

172
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
I have not felt at ease either.

173
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,846
It must have been the same with the King.

174
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,810
I heard everything

175
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,065
from why you had to leave
the palace in secrecy

176
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,027
to why you had to stay silent.

177
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,159
However, whatever the reason for
your going outside the palace is,

178
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,662
people who had no idea about it

179
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,829
must have thought

180
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,167
you were
an uncivilized and sassy princess.

181
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,589
You caused the King trouble so many times.

182
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,051
I apologize, Grandmother.

183
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,723
It is not too late.

184
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,558
Show people

185
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,687
your dignity and behavior as the Princess.

186
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,403
Thank you, master.

187
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,030
-Pardon?
-You stopped

188
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,157
my sister from leaving for Qing.

189
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,078
It mattered a lot to me as well.

190
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,913
Are you that happy?

191
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
Pardon?

192
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,545
Well...

193
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,090
You must be happy to be reinstated.

194
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,676
Well, of course.

195
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,888
I am more than happy to teach you again.

196
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,100
Prince.

197
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,774
Gosh, you are here too.

198
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,192
It is great to see you.

199
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,530
Did you not know I study at this hour?

200
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,907
Prince.

201
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,493
Eat this.

202
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,746
It is honey rice cake.

203
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,622
Try some.

204
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,208
Have some too.

205
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,795
I made it myself,
so make sure to finish them all.

206
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,213
Yes, Your Highness.

207
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,717
You made these yourself?

208
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,053
I did. Dig in.

209
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,722
Please have it first.

210
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,600
I will.

211
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,280
How is it, Master Gyeon?

212
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,995
Wow. I have never tasted
anything like this.

213
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,705
It has a very unique taste.

214
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,792
-Does that mean it tastes good?
-Yes.

215
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,468
Gosh, what on earth is this?

216
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,845
What did you put in the rice cake?

217
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,806
Did you put salt instead of honey?

218
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,725
Why? Is it salty?

219
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,563
Master, does it really taste good to you?

220
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,113
It does.

221
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,867
It is full of salt.

222
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,286
Did I pour too much salt
when I kneaded the dough?

223
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,665
It is just perfect to me.

224
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,572
Why are you looking at me like that?

225
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,324
You have...

226
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,285
Do I have

227
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,038
beauty on my face?

228
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,104
You could have just told me
if I had something on my face.

229
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,023
How rude!

230
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,941
I apologize.

231
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,777
Hyemyeong, why are you so mad?

232
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,906
You just saw what he did to me.

233
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,867
I cannot let this slide.

234
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,203
Let's have a talk outside.

235
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,292
What is the matter with her?

236
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,045
I think I made a mistake.

237
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,215
Please do not worry.
I will go and apologize to her.

238
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,385
Gosh.

239
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,310
I will start volunteering at the Bureau
of Medical Services today.

240
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,355
-Volunteering?
-Grandmother ordered me to do so

241
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,273
as a punishment
for sneaking out of the palace.

242
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,776
-You deserve it.
-What?

243
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,945
You know what you have done so far.

244
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,446
Do you want to die?

245
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,907
If you say you would die with me, yes.

246
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,871
Anyways, take care over there.

247
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,501
Do not worry. Byeol and Yeong-sin
will accompany me.

248
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,381
By the way, what happened
to Minister of Taxation?

249
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,217
He has not opened his mouth yet.

250
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,309
Stop.

251
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,312
Bring it to me.

252
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,370
Lieutenant Gang.

253
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,510
They already planned to kill you.

254
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,476
Are you mocking me?

255
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,147
The King will interrogate you
two days later.

256
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,357
You should tell him everything.

257
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,821
That is the only way to save your life.

258
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,495
He still remains silent?

259
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,874
I offered him a commutation of punishment,

260
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,876
but he did not even blink an eye.

261
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,922
He still believes that
they would get him out of prison.

262
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,093
I am sure it would be hard for him
to accept that he is abandoned.

263
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,889
I will do my best to persuade him
until the investigation.

264
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,312
You failed?

265
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,024
Fortunately, the minister
has not betrayed us yet.

266
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,193
Are you joking me?

267
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,111
I apologize.

268
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,455
The Queen wants you to come over.

269
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,464
I told you to stay quiet
until I take care of everything.

270
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,883
How am I supposed to stay quiet now?

271
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,384
The marriage is called off.

272
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,762
The Prince of Qing left for Qing,
and the Princess is still here.

273
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,431
And Minister of Taxation

274
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,226
is arrested on the charge of treason

275
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,436
for having a secret transaction.

276
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,565
I did not know he was
such a greedy person.

277
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,860
You really did not know about it?

278
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,322
How could I know what he had been up to?

279
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,117
You suggested the marriage
to the Qing Dynasty.

280
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,579
It is Qing that offered
the marriage first.

281
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,248
Sure.

282
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,626
You are right.

283
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,378
By the way,

284
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,924
you seem to be curious in
too many things, Your Highness.

285
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,385
Do not try to know everything.

286
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,304
If you do,

287
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,142
you will only put yourself in danger.

288
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,494
Councilor Jeong,

289
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,623
what on earth do you have up your sleeve?

290
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,879
Although it is a punishment,

291
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,298
you should have dressed up.

292
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,426
Everyone there must be waiting
to see how pretty you are.

293
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,554
Are you saying that I look hideous now?

294
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,348
No, Your Highness. Of course not.

295
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,186
Your beauty never fades
no matter what you wear.

296
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,440
I am not going there to show off my beauty

297
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,151
but to help the people in need.

298
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,196
So you need to work hard too.

299
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,739
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

300
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,536
CONGRATULATIONS! THE PRINCESS
PAYS A VISIT FOR A HELPING HAND

301
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,248
Gosh, I hate such those things.

302
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,542
But you do not have a choice.

303
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,017
Are you from the palace?

304
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,145
By the way,

305
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,523
where is the Princess?

306
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,193
So,

307
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,529
the Princess is not here today?

308
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,247
Well,

309
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,125
I apologize, Your Highness.

310
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,461
Please forgive me.

311
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,089
I said it is all right.

312
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,633
Is it really okay?

313
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,345
Everything is fine. I am not that uptight.

314
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,640
I see. Please follow me.

315
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,518
We prepared a place to rest

316
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,186
during your stay.

317
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,981
A place to rest?

318
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:11,778
Yes. We also prepared
sumptuous refreshments with tea.

319
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,113
I will show you the way.

320
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,660
I am not okay with that.

321
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,953
Pardon?

322
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,373
I am here to work, not to idle away.

323
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,252
So please assign work to me.
I will do my best.

324
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,630
I see.

325
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,813
It is dangerous. Play over there.

326
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,399
Come here.

327
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,277
What are you doing?

328
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,655
Let us go take your medicine.

329
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,575
It is time to take your medicine.

330
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,787
Good job. You are a good girl.

331
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,413
One more.

332
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,468
Please open your mouth.

333
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,755
Hearing only one side of story

334
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,216
causes estrangement only.

335
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,511
"Hearing only one side of story

336
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,763
causes...

337
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,225
estrangement only."

338
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,395
People will be estranged from each other

339
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,522
if they listen to only one side
of the story.

340
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,378
Are you okay, master?

341
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,922
I am.

342
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,218
Why did you eat so many salty rice cake?

343
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:26,639
You will understand when you grow up.

344
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,287
Master Gyeon.

345
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,759
I found it on my way here.

346
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,724
Are you here to see me?

347
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,645
I just happened to pass by.

348
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,773
I know you came to see me with flowers.

349
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,493
Actually, I...

350
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,038
thought about it.

351
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,582
I think...

352
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,001
Hey.

353
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,422
-Be my girlfriend.
-Are you serious?

354
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,845
Yes. I will give up everything
I wanted in my life

355
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,972
and...

356
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,099
Do you have to put it that way?

357
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,561
How do you want me to say then?

358
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,523
You could say that in a sweet manner.

359
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,026
Goodness.

360
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,616
Let me ask you one thing.

361
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,413
Do I look the most handsome in the world?

362
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,708
-Even more than flowers?
-Yes.

363
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,876
Gosh.

364
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,881
So it is our first day together, right?

365
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,508
If that is what you want, fine.

366
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,895
Hey.

367
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,607
-Hey, come here.
-Welcome.

368
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,443
This is so pretty. Try it on.

369
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,867
-Is it good?
-It is tasty.

370
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,788
-Do you want some taffy?
-What?

371
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,750
You know the caramel-like sweets.

372
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,501
Right.

373
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,588
I will have pumpkin taffy.

374
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,090
I will have the same too.

375
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,969
-Let us go.
-Let us go have some taffy.

376
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,813
-Down.
-What are you doing?

377
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,732
It is nothing.

378
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,992
-Are you embarrassed of me?
-A little. No, I mean...

379
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,454
Mal-geum.

380
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,708
Do not follow after me. You are so ugly.

381
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,796
Hey, what do you mean I am ugly?
She is really fast.

382
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,674
Hey! Mal-geum!

383
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,717
Hey!

384
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,473
How could he not follow after me
just because I told him not to?

385
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,687
My lady.

386
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,190
Where have you been?

387
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,776
-Sorry?
-Where have you been?

388
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,778
Well...

389
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,156
I went out to find out
how the Princess is doing.

390
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,827
The Princess?

391
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,665
Gosh, my whole body aches.

392
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,085
Byeol, give me a shoulder massage.

393
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,713
Now.

394
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,679
Hey, be gentler!

395
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,097
You asked for it.

396
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,980
Your Highness, are you all right?

397
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,690
I am fine.

398
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,119
Hey, her condition looks
quite grave, right?

399
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,179
Did something happen to you?

400
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,182
What is wrong?

401
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,856
It is your fault.

402
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,942
My fault? Why?

403
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,154
If it had not been for you,

404
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,699
I could have eaten taffy.

405
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,536
-What?
-What?

406
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,752
Are you dumped?

407
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,963
You have a girlfriend?

408
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,178
I guess not anymore.

409
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,808
You are wrong.

410
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,770
You got it wrong. Okay?

411
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,985
Do not worry.

412
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,115
You will see him chasing
a new woman around soon.

413
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,287
By the way, tell me what happened.

414
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,832
I heard that you caught the traitor
and got reinstated.

415
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,767
It seemed like Second State Councilor
Jeong was another regular of that place.

416
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,604
Wait. You dropped this. Take it.

417
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,649
Or find its owner.

418
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,735
You work at the Office of
Investigation after all.

419
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,922
No one had kept his word
to treat me later except you,

420
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,924
-right?
-You are so right.

421
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,886
-Please allow me to pour you a drink.
-Sure.

422
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,812
It tastes even better as it is free.

423
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,902
Was it really a coincidence?

424
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,991
-The one who wrote--
-Are you

425
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,036
suspecting me now?

426
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,958
Did you write it?

427
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,714
Do I get a reward if it was me?

428
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,383
Then I will just say I wrote it.
How much would I get?

429
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,763
-I hope it is a lot.
-I hope so too.

430
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,389
Then I will give you pocket money.

431
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,440
Thank you for coming all the way
to such a shabby place.

432
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,318
This is where we make medicine.

433
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,154
And we treat patients over there.

434
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,039
Lady Gyeon Hui.

435
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,043
It has been a while, Your Highness.

436
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,924
Do you remember me, Your Highness?

437
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,385
Who are you?

438
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,264
I heard that you work here.
So I came here to help

439
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,474
and correct the misunderstanding.

440
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,894
I am glad that you are willing
support a good cause.

441
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:56,107
Please forgive my rudeness
that was caused by my ignorance

442
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,358
about your identity.

443
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,027
I apologize, Your Highness.

444
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,196
Please forgive us.

445
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,743
I apologize to you too.

446
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,916
Please do not apologize, Your Highness.

447
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,252
Then let us get to work.

448
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,506
By the way, can you really
work in that dress?

449
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,760
Is there anything wrong with it?

450
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,346
Well, never mind.

451
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,779
You are not only pretty
but also kind-hearted.

452
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,657
You have gone through a lot
because of the Princess,

453
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,159
but you are here to help her.

454
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,829
It was a misunderstanding, so it is okay.

455
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,791
You will be the perfect wife
of my brother.

456
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,170
I think you impressed my mom

457
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,547
when you gave her the gift.

458
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,093
If Gyeon U had not been infatuated
with the Princess...

459
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,152
I wish to have you as my family
more than anyone.

460
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,033
Then we should make that happen.

461
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,011
This room is

462
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,223
for the patients who are seriously ill.

463
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,226
The one sleeping over there
stayed up all night due to pain

464
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,478
and fell asleep in the morning.

465
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,399
-Did he vomit all night long?
-Yes.

466
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,907
What if he has an infectious disease?

467
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,080
What are you doing? Apologize immediately.

468
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,084
How can I suppress coughs?

469
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,796
You faced this way intentionally
to transmit your disease, right?

470
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,631
Do you know who we are?

471
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,299
Seriously.

472
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,386
Apologize already.

473
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,270
My apologies.

474
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,982
What are you doing?

475
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,403
Well,

476
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,282
he just coughed at us.

477
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,076
That is such a ridiculous reason.

478
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,288
Head back now.

479
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,541
Stop causing trouble and leave.

480
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,378
We are here to help you.

481
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,465
Then why are you bossing around here?

482
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,341
Apologize to him right now.

483
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,557
Now!

484
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,059
-I apologize.
-I apologize.

485
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,273
If you want to stay here, behave and work.

486
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,518
Work harder.

487
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,021
The stain is not removed at all.
Do it again.

488
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,023
You must do it again too.

489
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:09,193
Hit it harder. Harder.

490
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,028
I said harder.

491
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,074
What is going on?

492
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,456
The ladies did not seem to know
how to work,

493
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,625
so I was instructing them.

494
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,300
Why do you not join them too?

495
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,473
Your Highness,

496
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,810
may I talk to you privately?

497
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,646
I am busy now.

498
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,399
It will not take long.

499
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,205
I apologize on behalf of my friends.

500
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,000
I do not think the apology should
be made to me.

501
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,127
They came here out of goodwill.

502
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,462
Still, I apologize for the stir.

503
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:15,259
I suggest that you stop wasting time
here and work with them.

504
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,180
You are indeed as I have heard.

505
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,685
I heard a lot about you

506
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,562
from Master Gyeon.

507
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:33,694
Please do not worry.
He talked only good things about you.

508
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,031
Why did Master Gyeon

509
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,825
talk about me to you?

510
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,669
I often see him as we will get
married soon.

511
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,423
He gave me this ornament as a token.

512
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,224
Did I startle you?

513
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,482
Master Gyeon has never

514
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,817
told me about it.

515
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,781
I guess he had no reason to do so.

516
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,578
Why would he tell you
such private matters?

517
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,802
No way.

518
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:44,223
Do you really think Master Gyeon
would marry Councilor Jeong's daughter?

519
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,689
Right. Councilor Jeong recommended
him to be in charge of reception.

520
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,857
Stop.

521
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,238
Do not worry.

522
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:03,575
I do not think he gave her
the ornament as a token.

523
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,453
Right.

524
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,749
Byeol, you said you saw Master Gyeon
visiting Councilor Jeong's house, right?

525
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,668
What is the matter?

526
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,843
Why are you so absent-minded?

527
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,431
Master Gyeon, did you come straight
here after work?

528
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,937
Would he have come here to see you
if what she said was true?

529
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,615
Give it to me. Let me do it.

530
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,325
No thanks.

531
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,205
Why are you so depressed?

532
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,502
Master Gyeon.

533
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,629
Yes, Your Highness.

534
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,633
Never mind.

535
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,262
Please just tell me.

536
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,683
Have you...

537
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,980
ever given an ornament to a lady?

538
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,860
How do you know...

539
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,451
Lady Da-yeon did?

540
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,538
She said she will marry you soon

541
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,541
and got the Princess riled up.

542
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,295
Is that true?

543
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,590
Is that why you visited
the Councilor Jeong's house?

544
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,592
That is ridiculous.

545
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,013
Then why did she say such a thing?

546
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,895
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

547
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,524
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

548
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,322
Your Highness.

549
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,372
Thank you.

550
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,998
Your Highness.

551
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,461
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

552
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,308
Nothing works out for me.

553
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,367
What are you doing?

554
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,869
That is total nonsense.

555
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,663
Then

556
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,957
explain about the ornament.

557
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,001
It was a token of my gratitude.

558
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,503
Then why would she lie to me?

559
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,422
It does not matter to me.

560
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,301
What matters to me is you
who is right in front of me

561
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,845
and how you feel now.

562
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,436
Do you feel better?

563
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,397
I do not know.

564
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,400
Then I will not let you go.

565
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,358
I know it is not easy for you
to be in here.

566
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,527
How is the case going?

567
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,614
The official investigation will
start tomorrow.

568
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,577
You should tell everything honestly.

569
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:33,553
Reveal all the truth at the investigation.

570
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,769
I will.

571
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,819
I cannot come to see you tomorrow.

572
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,573
The official investigation will be held.

573
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,496
Do you think the minister of Taxation
will talk about Councilor Jeong?

574
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,958
I should make him do so.

575
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,210
I will make sure the truth is revealed.

576
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,140
A criminal escaped!

577
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,559
Arrest him!

578
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,978
Never let the traitor

579
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,605
who betrayed the nation run away!

580
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,858
Arrest him!

581
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,831
Capture him no matter what.
You may kill him if it is needed.

582
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,791
-Arrest him!
-Yes, sir!

583
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,546
My lord... My lord....

584
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,025
My lord....

585
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,110
My lord....

586
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,126
The Minister of Taxation has been killed?

587
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,796
He attempted to escape from prison
between the shifts.

588
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,965
Why did they kill him
instead of arresting him?

589
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,259
The Minister of Defense ordered to do so,

590
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,888
saying they should never lose
the criminal charged with treason.

591
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,182
My apologies, Your Majesty.

592
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,877
Are you on your way back
from the Bureau of Medical Services?

593
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,341
Why are you going home so late?

594
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,344
A disturbing incident
took place in the palace.

595
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,013
What do you mean by that?

596
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,932
Have you not heard yet?

597
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,268
The Minister of Taxation is dead.

598
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,823
Is he

599
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,911
killing off his own people?

600
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,665
If Councilor Jeong

601
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,419
really plotted treason...

602
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,881
That means he will abandon me too.

603
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,425
Your Highness.

604
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,511
I cannot just sit back
and wait to be attacked.

605
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,429
I...

606
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,808
have suffered a lot to become the Queen.

607
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,978
I have borne all the harshness
to keep this position for ten years.

608
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,880
It is getting messy.

609
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,888
-I need you to stop.
-What do you mean?

610
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,851
I think you cannot have
Master Gyeon. Give up on him.

611
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,645
Father.

612
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,980
I do not want you to be
crooked-minded anymore.

613
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,777
I cannot give up.

614
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,161
What started bothering me never stops

615
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,289
-until I put an end to it.
-I can never put an end to it

616
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,708
like this.

617
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,486
Who is it?

618
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,363
My lord!

619
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,077
Are you all right, My lord?

620
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,431
RIGHT WILL PREVAIL IN THE END

621
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,895
YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW

622
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,580
You do not seem to have slept tight.

623
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,292
Is there any way

624
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,545
to bring down Jeong Gi-jun?

625
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,425
-Your Highness.
-I still cannot stop him

626
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,011
just like ten years ago.

627
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,221
Your Highness!

628
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,392
Your Highness, I found her.

629
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,936
The court lady who worked
at central palace ten years ago.

630
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,321
Please wait in your residence.

631
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,074
No. I need to meet her myself.

632
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,785
I will meet her instead.

633
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,454
Let us go together. Okay?

634
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,873
-It is too dangerous.
-Master Gyeon.

635
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,126
Please trust me and wait here.

636
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,465
Please tell me

637
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,427
what happened ten years ago.

638
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,265
I know nothing.

639
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,308
-Please.
-I no longer

640
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,353
belong to this world.

641
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,899
Please do not ask me
what happened in this world.

642
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,279
Please tell me anything.

643
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,364
Before you left the palace...

644
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,616
Why do you want to know it so badly?

645
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,871
I want to find

646
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,124
the mother of my lover.

647
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,339
Tell her to stop looking for her mother.

648
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,509
The mother of the Princess

649
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,013
was deposed after she committed
adultery with Prince Chuseong.

650
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,974
The Princess will be placed in danger

651
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,268
if she finds her mother.

652
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,395
What do you mean by that?

653
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,397
She committed adultery?

654
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,234
Please do not ask anymore.

655
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,598
Why can you not tell me about it?

656
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,016
What is the reason?

657
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,018
There must be a reason
why he keeps it to himself.

658
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,770
You should believe in your lover.

659
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,274
I am asking if Councilor Jeong
is about to betray me.

660
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,525
I need you to cut off his head.

661
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,151
Who in the world is doing this?

662
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,904
So Prince Chuseong is back?

663
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,448
I do not think Councilor Jeong
distributed it.

664
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,325
Do you think Prince Chuseong
really came back alive?

665
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,702
He is dead.

666
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,787
Lower the security and withdraw
the guards.

667
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,665
He must not notice that we are on a hunt.

668
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,710
I want to know about Prince Chuseong.

669
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,424
