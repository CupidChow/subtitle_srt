1
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,789
Let me see your face.

2
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,154
I am sure.

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,865
Like you ordered, I let him in for now.

4
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,806
50 SHADES OF THE YOUNG LADY

5
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,867
You are amazing.

6
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,204
What is your secret
to writing so many books?

7
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,875
I get inspiration when
I look at beautiful women.

8
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,130
And tonight, I might be able to finish
a book thanks to you, Your Highness.

9
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,383
Your Highness.

10
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,974
SECRETS OF
THE FEMALE TRANSVESTITE OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

11
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,685
THE PRINCESS' PRIVATE LIFE

12
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,400
What is this?

13
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,862
"The Princess' Private Life"?

14
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,448
I never had you in mind
when I wrote that book.

15
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,286
It is just a novel. Please do not
take it the wrong way.

16
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
It is all right.

17
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,248
-No!
-No!

18
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,167
Please... No...

19
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,878
I said it is all right.

20
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,380
I am not that narrow-minded.

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,014
You might not like what you read.

22
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,266
What's the matter?
You're making me curious.

23
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,436
It is not fun to read at all.

24
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,898
It is a piece of garbage.
Gwang-su wrote it.

25
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,317
Please kill him.

26
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
Gosh.

27
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,071
I cannot fall asleep when I am curious
about something.

28
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,700
It might be harder to fall asleep if you
read it.

29
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,285
You must have read it.

30
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,580
No way. I do not read things like that.

31
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,499
You did. That must be why
you are being like this.

32
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,257
What is the matter?

33
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,750
Master Min!

34
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,961
No.

35
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
Min Yu-hwan?

36
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,375
He's in the capital?

37
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,420
He must have heard that the Princess
is residing outside the palace.

38
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,882
He came to die of his own accord.

39
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,467
How shall I deal with it?

40
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,928
He cannot meet the Princess.

41
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
However,

42
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,975
bring him to me alive.

43
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,437
I have a lot to ask him.

44
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,942
Follow me quietly.

45
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,083
-It is dangerous.
-I need to talk to him.

46
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,419
-It may be another trap.
-I do not care.

47
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,589
I do not care even if
it is a trap, so let go!

48
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,595
Then I shall go with you.

49
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,974
I cannot let you go alone.

50
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,903
That was a bad move.

51
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,533
Do you think so?

52
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,507
Why is the princess still staying
outside the palace?

53
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,511
I only laid the groundwork of my plan.

54
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,015
It is not fun to let the other
know your entire plan.

55
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,314
Being too complicated

56
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,567
is not fun either.

57
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,656
Does she irritate you a lot?

58
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,912
I shall remove her soon.

59
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,622
So do not worry.

60
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,333
Please hurry.

61
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,253
It is getting harder to hold in.

62
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,386
I have

63
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,554
brought him.

64
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,599
Good job.

65
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,483
Why did you release that butcher?

66
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,528
We searched through the butcher's,

67
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,947
but could not find
a single piece of evidence

68
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,242
that proves his involvement
in the jirashi incident.

69
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,457
I cannot keep the innocent
in prison. You know that.

70
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,433
Jeong Gi-jun.

71
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,310
It has been a while.

72
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,774
The dethroned queen is alive?

73
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,610
The Princess has her jade ring.

74
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,447
The dethroned queen had
that ring ten years ago.

75
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,825
There is no way.

76
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,702
We saw her dead body.

77
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,662
But we could not check her face.

78
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,625
What if that dead body was not her?

79
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,212
What if she was not attacked
by wild animals?

80
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,257
Why did you come to think so?

81
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,717
I think

82
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,804
Master Min has found her.

83
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,224
Do you mean the Princess' teacher?

84
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,184
Ever since he came back
from his investigation,

85
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,313
they often meet in secret.

86
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,610
That brazen girl must be planning
to bring her mother back in.

87
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,237
She wants to kick me out
and put her mother on my seat.

88
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,323
The King must not...

89
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,242
He must never find this out.

90
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,872
Eliminate both the Princess...

91
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,710
-and Master Min.
-That is not important now.

92
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,921
If she is really alive,

93
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,174
we need to find out

94
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,885
who saved her for what reason.

95
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,398
Have you been well?

96
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,575
It must have been tough
to live with a price on your head.

97
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,623
Why did you not come visit me earlier?

98
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,751
We have a lot to talk about.

99
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,722
Your Majesty, the Queen is
here to see you.

100
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,308
Let her in.

101
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,486
What brings you here?

102
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,321
I heard

103
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,282
you have not been sleeping well
these days.

104
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,659
I brought lotus leaf tea.

105
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,002
I have had enough tea already.
Leave it and go.

106
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,758
Is it because of the Princess?

107
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,140
I am very much concerned
about her as well.

108
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,767
She is there to take a rest,

109
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,938
but I feel anxious to leave
her outside like that.

110
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,028
I will guide and teach her.

111
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,865
Why do you not bring her
into the palace now?

112
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,879
-My Queen.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,256
If you are that anxious and worried,

114
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,550
take this tea and have it yourself.

115
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,055
You may leave now.

116
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,600
I have a lot of work to do.

117
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,704
The way he looked at me

118
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,749
was like a freezing wind.

119
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,797
I must have lost his favor that night.
I am certain.

120
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,549
What should I do now?

121
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,968
What if he tries to avoid me?

122
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,679
Your Highness.

123
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,432
Do you remember what the shaman told you?
It is tonight.

124
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,402
-Where is my order?
-It is coming.

125
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,487
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

126
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,120
Here. Thanks for the food.

127
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,836
-Excuse me.
-What?

128
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,972
Let us go back.

129
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,891
Everyone must be worried by now.

130
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,561
Are you going to stay up
all night like this?

131
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,063
You should go back.

132
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,108
You go.

133
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,402
Do you believe he will come back?

134
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,530
You know that he went with
the guy with a scar.

135
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,992
Just report this to
the Office of Investigation.

136
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,663
Whether he came back to see
you or harm you, they might--

137
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,998
I cannot do that.

138
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
His limbs will be torn apart
if he gets caught.

139
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,714
I cannot put him in danger.

140
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,549
What if you get hurt?

141
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,593
What are you trying to do
with a wanted person?

142
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,886
What do you know?

143
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,513
What makes you think
you can say such things?

144
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,769
I just do not want you...

145
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,191
to be in danger because of him.

146
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,448
I do not want you...

147
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,202
to be in pain anymore.

148
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,425
Here you are.

149
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,930
We should go.

150
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,641
His Majesty is waiting.

151
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,749
She went to the rental bookstore
with Master Gyeon.

152
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,544
Why did they not take someone
from the Office of Investigation?

153
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,088
They said they would be back soon.

154
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,133
They did not want to
draw people's attention.

155
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,853
Why are they not back yet?

156
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,983
Is there really nothing
between him and the Princess?

157
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,068
Last time, they were found
in the same bed--

158
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,737
Stop that nonsense.

159
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,614
Your reckless words may bring bad luck.

160
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,576
But seriously! They are suspicious.

161
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,952
Shut it.

162
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,123
The talk about him becoming her
husband is giving me a headache.

163
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,127
I do not care who she is.
I will kick her out of our house.

164
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:35,095
Where did my Gyeon U go?

165
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,814
My apologies, Your Majesty.

166
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,941
It is fine.

167
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,653
I am the one who is giving you trouble.

168
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,698
Please do not say that.

169
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,996
I am not sure if keeping her
outside like this is a good idea.

170
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,877
Bring her in
and move her marriage forward.

171
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,253
That will be

172
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,882
the only way to protect her.

173
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,201
Hide all these 100 talismans
in her bedroom.

174
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,287
Then His Majesty will care
less about the Princess.

175
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,873
It will lead him to focus more on you.

176
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,879
This must not turn out to
be another failure.

177
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,798
Since the Princess is outside,

178
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,969
this will be the perfect chance.

179
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,645
Sister.

180
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,862
Mother.

181
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,697
Queen.

182
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,701
What are you doing in
the Princess' room at this hour?

183
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,704
I missed her, so I thought

184
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,583
visiting her room
would make me feel better.

185
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,084
I see.

186
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,264
I guess we shared the same thought.

187
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,643
We came because we missed her too.

188
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,978
Is that right?

189
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,981
It is surprising that
we shared the same thought.

190
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,165
I will send you a message
as soon as they are back.

191
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,375
Please do not worry.

192
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,523
Father.

193
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,442
My apologies.

194
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,861
It is all my fault.

195
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,456
I will bring you in.

196
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,379
Come back to the palace.

197
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,136
Chief Scholar Gyeon.

198
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,931
Send her in when everything is prepared.

199
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,182
Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,294
What happened?

201
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,131
I told you already. We were
at the rental bookstore--

202
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:43,010
People from Office of Investigation
went to the rental bookstore first.

203
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,555
What is it that you are hiding?

204
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,560
Tell me the truth.

205
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,188
I have...

206
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,066
nothing to say.

207
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,580
How is Her Highness?

208
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,082
She wants to be alone.

209
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,245
The Princess' lover?

210
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,999
I only read it in the jirashi.

211
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:59,586
The guy's name is Min Yu-hwan.
He went missing three years ago

212
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,963
while doing a secret investigation.

213
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,381
He went missing?

214
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,968
Yes, it is because
he got caught taking bribes.

215
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,013
He must be still on the wanted list.

216
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,981
What do you know?

217
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,359
What makes you think
you can say such a thing?

218
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,368
I will bring you in.

219
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,249
Come back to the palace.

220
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,303
She wandered around late at night?

221
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,432
I forgave her for running away
during her probation.

222
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,560
Now, she is getting out of control.

223
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,313
Seeing how Master Gyeon stayed quiet,

224
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,440
there must be a reason.

225
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,111
What is she up to?

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,908
I think we better hurry with her marriage.

227
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,120
If she has a husband,

228
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,165
she will have someone to lean on.

229
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,667
Then she will stop causing trouble.

230
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,171
Choosing her husband is not easy either.

231
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,716
They will try to put up someone
on their side as her future husband.

232
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,604
The King visited
Chief Scholar Gyeon's house today.

233
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,733
The Princess disappeared
without a word again.

234
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,778
People from the Office of
Investigation searched everywhere.

235
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,074
She must have lost her control after
seeing someone she has been waiting for.

236
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,619
Now,

237
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,249
it is time we show them what we prepared.

238
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,489
Where are you going?

239
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,625
Are you going to find him?

240
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,086
I need to meet him.

241
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,548
I do not know when I will
be able to come out again.

242
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:57,264
This may be the last chance to meet him.

243
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,849
-Your Highness.
-Let me go, Master Gyeon.

244
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,604
Please.

245
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,685
The Princess will come back

246
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,313
and I shall start looking for
her future husband.

247
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,814
There will be a ban on marriage

248
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,900
throughout the nation until she gets
married. Prepare for her wedding.

249
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,571
Your Majesty.

250
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,574
You will not need to
look for the candidates.

251
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,743
What do you mean?

252
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,494
The Qing Dynasty

253
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,831
has suggested
a royal marriage with the Princess.

254
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,336
If Qing and Joseon become allies
through a royal marriage,

255
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,088
it would be perfect for us.

256
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,633
He is known to be a competent
person trusted by the Emperor.

257
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,469
It will be a great advantage
for the nation

258
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,721
if such a man becomes
the Princess' husband.

259
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,099
How could you suggest sending
our Princess to such a far land?

260
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,061
It is a good way to calm down

261
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,771
people's anger against her.

262
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:28,855
Minister of Defense.

263
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,733
-That was out of line.
-What?

264
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,362
Your Majesty.

265
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,114
Marriage is very important in one's life.

266
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,617
And it is the Princess' marriage.

267
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,786
Please consider this matter carefully.

268
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,372
It is right to be cautious,

269
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,624
but I am worried if she will
miss the right timing.

270
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,833
Please

271
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,669
think of the Princess.

272
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,968
I disapprove.

273
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,849
I cannot send her to the Qing.

274
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,950
They seem to have something in mind

275
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,787
seeing how they are trying to rush
her wedding with the Qing.

276
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,540
I will never approve this.

277
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,959
They are up to something suspicious.

278
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,336
I am worried.

279
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,342
Why are they after the Princess?

280
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,020
Are you saying you could not
change His Majesty's mind?

281
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,485
It was impossible to begin with.

282
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
Just

283
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
ask him to do the husband selection.

284
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,907
It is not over yet.

285
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,535
It is just the beginning.

286
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,466
He insists on

287
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,385
sending her to the Qing.

288
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:26,973
Councilor Jeong said he would find a way.

289
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,309
He could just send her

290
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,437
to an island or to the countryside.

291
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,690
It is strange that he is trying
to send her to the Qing.

292
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,444
Does he have another intention?

293
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,917
50 SHADES OF THE YOUNG LADY

294
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,547
"50 shades of the young lady."

295
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,633
-What do you say?
-Goodness!

296
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,052
What do you take us for?

297
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,555
How dare you recommend
that disgusting book to us?

298
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,681
What?

299
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,725
Disgusting?

300
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,853
Even the daughter of Councilor Jeong

301
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,940
borrowed this book in a hurry.

302
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,484
Da-yeon?

303
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
Really?

304
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,823
Sure. It must have been so fun to read.

305
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,908
She even paid the late fee.

306
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,914
Da-yeon, that brat
pretended she was aloof.

307
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,628
Look.

308
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,925
Goodness.

309
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,885
You are here.

310
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,971
Please come inside.

311
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,978
This way. I'm sorry
this place is so shabby...

312
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,648
Come inside.

313
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,453
-Go inside first.
-Yes, master.

314
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,670
It is hard to find him without any clue.

315
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,465
Having his portrait may help you find him.

316
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,011
He could be put in danger
if the Office of Investigation

317
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,679
finds out he is in the capital
because of me.

318
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,765
Se-ho and Gwang-su are trustworthy.

319
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,100
Mr. Hwang as well.

320
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,687
I don't think I can do this.

321
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,857
Then what about the man with the scar?

322
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,985
We can draw his portrait.

323
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,946
Since they went together,
looking for that man

324
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,865
could lead us to Master Min.

325
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Please go inside.

326
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,828
We cannot drag time here.

327
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,834
Will they be here again?

328
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,669
If the Office of Investigation comes,

329
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,546
don't tell them that we were here.

330
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,049
Goodness.

331
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,675
It is done.

332
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,135
Who is it?

333
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,930
Just drawing his face scared me.

334
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,181
Let us hurry.

335
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,183
Who is he?

336
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:22,023
Gyeon U,
it is time for your herbal tonics.

337
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,776
Son?

338
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,744
Where did he go again?

339
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,496
Goodness.

340
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,916
He would not have gone
to meet the Princess, would he?

341
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,682
I cannot believe this.

342
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,142
Must I guard Gyeon U's house?

343
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,814
The Princess will be
returning to the palace.

344
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,941
-It is just for today--
-That

345
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,653
still irritates me.

346
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,199
What?

347
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,255
Lady Da-yeon.

348
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,967
What brings you here?

349
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,137
Are you here

350
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,139
to see Gyeon U?

351
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,850
Should I answer?

352
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,564
As a second lieutenant,
I cannot let anyone inside.

353
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,151
Am I

354
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,653
just anyone?

355
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,324
It is not that--

356
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,995
Da-yeon.

357
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,254
What are you doing to my guest?

358
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631
Let us go in.

359
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,014
Goodness.

360
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,100
Like brother, like sister.

361
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,062
Are you here to greet the Princess?

362
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,815
I heard she returns to
the palace tomorrow.

363
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,028
Should we not make up
before she leaves here?

364
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,573
What is wrong with you?

365
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,575
Let go of me.

366
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,786
The Office of Investigation
must know of this.

367
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,621
-Goodness.
-No.

368
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,082
The Princess leaves here tomorrow,
so just pretend not to know.

369
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,917
So why did she take my son with her?

370
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,170
Do you think it is only the Princess
who will be punished?

371
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
Master Gyeon will be punished too.

372
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,131
Are you threatening me now?

373
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,926
It is a favor I am asking you.

374
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,886
You must not tell anyone

375
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,180
that she sneaked out.

376
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,349
-Let go.
-Goodness!

377
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,205
Well

378
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,251
It would be great if you would
forget what you have just heard.

379
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:33,047
He was forced to go with
her as he is too nice.

380
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,383
If it becomes a big deal...

381
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,219
Do not worry.

382
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,972
Why would I tell others

383
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,391
something that could harm Master Gyeon?

384
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,813
-Thank you.
-Mother.

385
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,399
Da-yeon is not like that.

386
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,818
She is too kind

387
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,611
that she came to make up with the Princess

388
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,655
even though she did nothing wrong.

389
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,369
You flatter me. It is nothing.

390
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,832
Drink some tea.

391
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,270
Have you seen this man?

392
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,116
Have you seen this man?

393
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,263
The Princess went outside?

394
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,973
Did you not know?

395
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,100
It seems like she left a while ago.

396
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,020
You should hurry

397
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,022
before you get in trouble.

398
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,286
Have you seen this man?

399
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,746
No.

400
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,966
Whom are you looking for desperately?

401
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,439
Your lover?

402
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,067
No.

403
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,200
Did you fall for me?

404
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,077
Why are you staring at me?

405
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,373
What is wrong?

406
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,336
Have you seen this man?

407
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,845
Yes.

408
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,852
-Put it over there.
-Okay.

409
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,238
Are you inside?

410
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,074
Hello, my lord.

411
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,035
I see the pigs have become chubby.

412
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,369
You are here.

413
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,164
Are the meats fresh today?

414
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,583
Yes my lord. They are very fresh.

415
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,918
Welcome.

416
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,509
Are they your company?

417
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,804
What shall I get for you?

418
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,058
We did not come here to buy meat.

419
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,061
Do you know this guy by any chance?

420
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,979
I heard he comes here often.

421
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,280
I am not sure.

422
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,199
Try to remember.

423
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,368
I think I have seen him here a few times.

424
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,287
I do not know.

425
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,373
Take another look at the picture.

426
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,926
I have so many people who come and go.

427
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,053
I am not smart enough

428
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,640
to remember every customer.

429
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,149
It's not the kind of face that
you would forget that easily.

430
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,537
Well, he does not know.

431
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,415
Let us just buy some meat
and go for a picnic.

432
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,212
I will treat you,
so do not be so disappointed.

433
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,715
What will be delicious?

434
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,136
My lord, it is this way.

435
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,721
Let us go.

436
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,186
Look at all these parts of meat.
They look delicious.

437
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,604
They are not fresh.

438
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,274
I want to have a closer look.

439
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,733
We will get going then.

440
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,261
By the way,

441
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,723
I hear a strange noise on the floor.

442
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,520
I have beef as well.

443
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,689
Which part should I give you?

444
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,149
Right.

445
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,152
Shall I have some cow liver then?

446
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,031
By the way,

447
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,659
you need to fix the floor.

448
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,996
I guess so.

449
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,676
This part. You need to fix this part.

450
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,472
Goodness.

451
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,350
What are you?

452
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,602
Why are you doing this to me?

453
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,229
Goodness.

454
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,206
Stay still.

455
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,637
Where is he?

456
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,715
Master Min.

457
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,736
What about Min Yu-hwan?

458
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,696
I killed him before leaving.

459
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,824
My apologies.

460
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,328
Hide yourself until I give you
a new order.

461
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,502
I am innocent.

462
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,337
My gosh.

463
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,548
-What happened?
-I came to buy meat

464
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,385
and the floor made this
weird creaking noise.

465
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,638
I had no idea a dead body
was under the floor.

466
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,354
This way.

467
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,000
Your Highness, this is my close friend.

468
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,919
He was placed in
the Office of Investigation after passing

469
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,880
the recent state exam
as the youngest candidate.

470
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,466
I am Gang Jun-yeong, Your Highness.

471
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,530
Do you not know how to smile?

472
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,907
Do not be so serious.

473
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,326
You look like you are taking
on all the burden in the world.

474
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,709
She is a poor lady.

475
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:41,006
She looks bright,
but she must be hurting so much inside.

476
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,348
Please take good care of her.

477
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,986
Min Yu-hwan was found dead

478
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,071
in the base where they made the jirashis?

479
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,614
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,662
I do not know why they were after him.

481
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,706
Your Majesty,

482
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,001
Second Lieutenant Park is here to see you.

483
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,168
Let him in.

484
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,425
Your Majesty,

485
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,719
the Princess disappeared.

486
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,054
What?

487
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,932
Master Gyeon went out with the Princess

488
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,767
leaving us unnoticed.

489
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,104
Master Gyeon?

490
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,703
Our men were arrested,

491
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,581
and Wol-myeong is on the wanted list.

492
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,834
What shall we do now?

493
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,801
It is nice.

494
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,230
Something is wrong.

495
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,815
Look!

496
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,735
Come help them out!

497
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,509
Apparently, the Princess

498
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,095
has been out with Master Gyeon.

499
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,722
I thought things were getting hard for us,

500
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,016
but the Princess is helping us out.

501
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,522
The wind is blowing in our direction,
so we need to set sail.

502
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,774
Prepare thoroughly

503
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,860
so that things go as we planned.

504
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,800
It is all over now.

505
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,933
I thought...

506
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,064
I would be able to meet
my mother this time.

507
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,290
You do not have to hold in...

508
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,878
if you want to cry.

509
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,634
Think that I'm not here.

510
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,757
Master Min brought

511
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,386
Mother's jade ring.

512
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,723
He promised me...

513
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,019
he would come back
with her no matter what.

514
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,733
There must be a way to find her.

515
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,404
I shall help you from now on.

516
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,241
But

517
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,994
you must go back now.

518
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,205
Your Highness.

519
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,084
If you are reading this now,

520
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,213
I might never be able to see you again.

521
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:26,930
Three years ago,

522
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,516
I went to get her,

523
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,521
but it was after she disappeared.

524
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,527
WANTED, MIN YU-HWAN

525
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,573
Why is he wanted?

526
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,159
-I do not know.
-Maybe he did something wrong.

527
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,454
I tried to hurry back and tell you this,

528
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,875
but I had to run away
as I was being framed.

529
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,965
Now,

530
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,344
I know who chased me and framed me.

531
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,515
-Mother.
-Take her.

532
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,559
-My baby.
-Mother.

533
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,353
-My baby.
-Mother.

534
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,480
Mother!

535
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,236
Father, please save Mother.

536
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,904
Mother is...

537
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,239
Go back to your room.

538
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,034
Father.

539
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,166
Your Majesty, please hurry.

540
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,919
We have found evidence for treason.

541
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,061
Father.

542
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,188
Your mother has committed a crime.

543
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,523
Do not look for her anymore.

544
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,905
Father.

545
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,576
What has she done?

546
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,370
What did she do so wrong
that she is expelled?

547
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,914
What are you doing?

548
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,333
Take her immediately.

549
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,002
Let go.

550
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,379
Let go.

551
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,257
Let go of me.

552
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,555
Jeong Gi-jun.

553
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,475
Be careful of that man.

554
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,072
Your Highness.

555
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,427
What are you trying to do?

556
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,221
We have no evidence or witnesses.

557
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,640
You cannot do anything
only with that letter.

558
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,934
Then what do you suggest me to do?

559
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,187
Just stay quiet pretending not to know?

560
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,649
You must if necessary.

561
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,235
You can win every battle

562
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,238
if you know yourself and the enemy.

563
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,282
It would not be too late

564
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,200
to take action

565
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,162
after finding out what exactly
happened to your mother

566
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,205
ten years ago.

567
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,293
Your Majesty.

568
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:47,130
Dethrone the Princess.

569
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,716
-Dethrone the Princess.
-Dethrone the Princess.

570
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,012
Your Majesty,

571
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,140
sneaking out of the palace
without permission was not enough,

572
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:00,727
but she went outside again
and cannot be found now.

573
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,480
You cannot be silent about this anymore.

574
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:08,234
Please dethrone her.

575
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,070
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

576
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,489
Your Majesty,

577
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,950
please dethrone her.

578
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,578
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

579
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:24,417
Please dethrone the Princess.

580
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,421
Your Majesty, Second State Councilor Jeong
is here to see you.

581
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,133
Let him in.

582
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,280
Please dethrone the Princess.

583
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,283
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

584
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,618
Your Majesty,

585
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,664
please dethrone her.

586
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,667
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

587
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,649
The Princess is wandering around
the Office of State Records?

588
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,568
Did you read the state records?

589
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,736
It was ordered to put
in silence for 100 years.

590
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,447
-If you are caught...
-I might be killed.

591
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,699
You know well.

592
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,826
Do not attempt to know more.

593
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,703
Forget everything you have found out.

594
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,122
Do not ever hang out with the Princess.

595
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,624
You do not deserve to
be the Crown Prince's teacher.

596
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,710
I will dismiss you from your position.

597
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,046
I need to find Mother.

598
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,674
She must have heard something
from Min Yu-hwan.

599
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,634
I have his letter that he left behind.

600
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,803
Are you not curious?

601
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,098
The Qing's Prince is
coming here to see you.

602
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,476
I am not going anywhere. I cannot.

603
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,315
