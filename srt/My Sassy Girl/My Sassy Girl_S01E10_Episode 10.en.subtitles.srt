1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,382
Please help me protect

2
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,843
the people I love.

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,268
She has no choice but to go to Qing.

4
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,563
The Prince's installation to be
a crown prince is on the line.

5
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,822
Princess.

6
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,867
What is your wish?

7
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,914
What is your wish?

8
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,879
It is a secret.

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,175
If you tell me, I can make it happen.

10
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,180
"I can make it happen."

11
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,975
Tell him.

12
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,407
May I tell you about my wish first?

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,124
My wish is to live with you
for the rest of my life.

14
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,845
Please go ahead and translate that for me.

15
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,943
What is it?

16
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,655
-Master Gyeon.
-Gyeon U.

17
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,242
I cannot translate that.

18
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,710
I cannot

19
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,254
translate that.

20
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,693
You are right.

21
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,195
I should tell it to her myself.

22
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,829
Princess,

23
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,000
I will keep my wish a secret
for a little longer.

24
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,872
Goodnight, Princess.

25
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,752
Goodnight, Princess.

26
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,825
Why don't we have another drink?

27
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,854
I am thinking about hosting a banquet.

28
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,233
I will tell them to prepare in accordance.

29
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:24,240
I intend to propose to
the Princess at the banquet.

30
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,043
Can you help me?

31
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,550
I would like to ask her to marry me

32
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,386
in your language.

33
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,999
I cannot translate that.

34
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,661
Da-yeon.

35
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,374
Why is she playing so hard to get?

36
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,504
It is like she is teasing me.

37
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,174
She does whatever she pleases.

38
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,976
Gyeon U?

39
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,199
You annoying punk.

40
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,872
You are drunk.
Stop picking on people and go home.

41
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,125
Stop right there.

42
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,548
I said stop!

43
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
Gosh, it hurts.

44
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,345
I told you to stop.

45
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,270
Do you think I will give up?

46
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
I will never give up like this!

47
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,150
I will do whatever it takes

48
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,611
to stop you from having her.

49
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,681
Master Doggy.

50
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,644
What should I do?

51
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,354
"On the last day of this month,

52
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,356
you will be able to see

53
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,443
the murderer of Min Yu-hwan
at the temple at 10 p.m."

54
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,329
Watch carefully.

55
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,456
If the information is true,

56
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,668
there will be some kind of movement
before the last day.

57
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,670
Yes, sir.

58
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,650
You are throwing a banquet?

59
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,112
He wants to invite all the officials

60
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,740
as he will make a huge announcement.

61
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,709
Help the Prince of Qing

62
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,629
so that he does not have any problems

63
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,548
when preparing for the banquet.

64
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,800
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,400
A banquet all of a sudden?

66
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,611
It does not feel right.

67
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,783
I get it! It is to propose
to Your Highness--

68
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,416
No way.

69
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,378
That will not happen. Right.

70
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,314
Just let me know
if there is anything you need.

71
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,275
It will be a special day for
both you and the Princess.

72
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,653
It must be as grand as possible.

73
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,405
He is willing to help
prepare for the banquet

74
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,199
as it will be a special day

75
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,700
for you and the Princess.

76
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,871
Today is her day,
so I want to make sure she is satisfied.

77
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,623
He wants everything to be

78
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,918
in favor of the Princess
since it is her day.

79
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,464
I shall discuss this matter with Eunuch Ju

80
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,843
to make sure the Princess is satisfied.

81
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,011
They will try their best.

82
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,764
Thank you in advance.

83
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,517
He thanks you in advance.

84
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,274
-Let us go together.
-Okay.

85
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,526
-Let us go.
-Okay.

86
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,242
He seems quite close to others.

87
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,581
He came to Joseon several times
as a messenger.

88
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,541
So of course they are close.

89
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,924
It is ready.

90
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,888
Good. I got it.

91
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,441
What is this?

92
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,361
Open it, Your Highness.

93
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,380
Do you like it?

94
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,509
This thing makes objects
that are very far away, look big.

95
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:24,595
You showed me a similar one before.

96
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,347
I am not interested.

97
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,024
Are you that sad to
send your sister off to Qing?

98
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,612
My late mother was also from Joseon.

99
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,331
He says his mother was also from Joseon.

100
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,086
She missed Joseon a lot.

101
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,838
So she mentioned Joseon quite often.

102
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,882
However, it does not

103
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,426
mean that she was unhappy in Qing.

104
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,304
My father loved her so dearly

105
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,473
and she also often said that

106
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,017
coming to Qing was the right decision.

107
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,648
I will try to be that kind of
husband to your sister.

108
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,360
I will love, adore and protect her

109
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,280
so that she can be the happiest princess
in the whole world.

110
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,701
We will visit Joseon often after marriage.

111
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,579
You will be able to see her

112
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,625
so please do not be upset.

113
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,053
I am not sure what I should
prepare for her wedding gift.

114
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,890
She will be leaving right after
after the banquet, you know.

115
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,059
There are so many things

116
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,854
I need to prepare now that she is leaving.

117
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,692
I guess you care very much about her.

118
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,069
I am her mother after all.

119
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,655
-By the way.
-Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,742
You look somewhat pleasant and happy.

121
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,202
Others may think

122
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,831
you are very excited to send her off.

123
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,958
That is not true.

124
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,378
My heart breaks due to the sadness,

125
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,881
but I should prepare everything
perfectly--

126
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,508
You are going too far.

127
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,721
-Pardon?
-When you are that sad,

128
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,557
you should behave accordingly.

129
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,143
My apologies.

130
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,702
That old bag.

131
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,873
You should be more careful
until the Princess leaves.

132
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,543
It will not do you any good
if you lose her favor.

133
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,962
Until when

134
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,882
must I walk on eggshells
around that old bag?

135
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,305
Endure it for just a little longer,
Your Highness.

136
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,892
All right.

137
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,521
Let us get rid of the Princess first.

138
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,607
Let us do it step by step.

139
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,867
It is so pretty.

140
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,997
Have you heard?

141
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,542
The Prince of Qing is throwing
a banquet soon.

142
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,877
The Princess will be leaving
for Qing soon.

143
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,045
I heard Master Gyeon is

144
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,965
in charge of the reception.

145
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,260
What is wrong about it?

146
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,595
He must be heartbroken.

147
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,932
He is marrying off his lover.

148
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,021
What lover?

149
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,064
I told you many times.

150
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,692
My brother and the Princess
are not dating.

151
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,069
If you keep on spreading
that ridiculous rumor...

152
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,779
It is not a ridiculous rumor.

153
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,240
I saw it all.

154
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,491
Saw what?

155
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,995
I saw them going into
the rental bookstore together.

156
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,246
That is not true.

157
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,123
I saw them too.

158
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,125
Right, we saw them too.

159
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,752
So did I.

160
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
Hyo-jin.

161
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,473
Does your father work at
the Capital District Office?

162
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,225
Why do you ask?

163
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,478
I just heard about

164
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,272
a vacant position in Tamna.

165
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,864
Seon-gyeong and Bo-yeong.

166
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,617
Where does your father work?

167
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,883
There...

168
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,053
There is someone

169
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,097
who I wish to get married to.

170
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,976
He wants everything to be...

171
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,621
What is wrong with him?

172
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,625
Is it because of the Prince of Qing?

173
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,753
-It is because of the Princess.
-They are the same.

174
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,171
Goodness.

175
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,717
Why don't we go for a drink?

176
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,804
-Or to the Kisaeng Parlor?
-You punk.

177
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,932
I am not doing it for my sake.

178
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,893
I am doing this to make him feel better.

179
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,196
Forget it all.

180
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,575
Half of the people in the world are women.

181
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,744
It is the royal marriage.

182
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,747
There is nothing you can do about it.

183
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,924
My gosh.

184
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,886
Why are you so late?

185
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,013
What? Is something wrong?

186
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:46,185
Second State Councilor Jeong
invited you to his house.

187
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,603
Second State Councilor Jeong?

188
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,379
Do not get your hopes up.

189
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,382
I'm just meeting him to check things out.

190
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,274
Hello, master.

191
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,444
Please go in. He is waiting for you.

192
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,489
Master Gyeon?

193
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,295
How is the reception going?

194
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,422
Is everything all right?

195
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,258
Yes.

196
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,137
I am grateful for how you offered me

197
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,098
this valuable opportunity.

198
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,061
The royal marriage depends on this event.
Please keep up the good work.

199
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,439
By the way,

200
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,943
there is something
I would like to ask you.

201
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,321
Who requested a royal marriage

202
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,865
with the Princess?

203
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,536
Why do you ask?

204
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,083
It is just out of curiosity.

205
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,459
"Curiosity..."

206
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,087
I apologize if I went too far.

207
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,508
I would like to answer your question,
but I'm afraid I don't know either.

208
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,845
Shall I get to the point now?

209
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,222
I invited you today

210
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,932
because I intend to

211
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,601
promote you after the reception.

212
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,273
What do you mean?

213
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,733
I intend to

214
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,445
give you my full support
so you can have a successful career.

215
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
I learned to always
be honest and honorable.

216
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,285
Thank you for the offer,
but I'm going to have to refuse.

217
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,958
You are the son of
Chief Scholar Gyeon indeed.

218
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,087
I shall leave you if you are done.

219
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,881
Do you feel uncomfortable around me?

220
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,135
The people say that

221
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,306
the Second State Councilor Jeong is
above the King.

222
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,895
I took it as an irreverent rumor,

223
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,355
but seeing how you are offering
your full support,

224
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,899
it seems like you believe in

225
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,401
that rumor more than anyone else.

226
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,112
And that makes me a little uncomfortable.

227
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,512
Master Gyeon.

228
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,392
I was on my way to serve you
a glass of lotus leaf wine.

229
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,938
Why are you leaving already?

230
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,191
I will see you next time.

231
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,210
Father.

232
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,632
Yes.

233
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,927
I can see why you desire to be with him.

234
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,513
However,

235
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,101
the fish that lives in clear water
tends to be bony.

236
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:01,481
I'll need more time to decide
if he can be your husband or not.

237
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,369
Gyeon U. What did
Second State Councilor Jeong say?

238
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,288
Does he support
your relationship with Da-yeon?

239
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,294
I will keep this from your father.

240
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,337
So tell us.

241
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,257
Right. We are so curious.

242
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,217
It was nothing.

243
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,720
So tell us.

244
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,474
He would not have invited
you at night for nothing.

245
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,851
Tell us.

246
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,022
Was it about your marriage?

247
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,399
Mother.

248
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,241
Tell you what?

249
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,243
Nothing.

250
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,163
Right, Father. It is nothing.

251
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,581
Right, Gyeon U?

252
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,542
I will go in first.

253
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,137
Nothing.

254
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,851
Master Gyeon went to see
Second State Councilor Jeong?

255
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,311
Yes, Your Highness.

256
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,232
Second State Councilor Jeong did recommend

257
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,025
Master Gyeon
to be in charge of the reception.

258
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,194
He is acting strangely.

259
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,658
Does that mean he is
Second State Councilor Jeong's person now?

260
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,577
But that is how it seems.

261
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,163
It is not the first time the officials
betrayed each other for power.

262
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,581
They are like bats.

263
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,668
Why don't you just make a hole on my body?

264
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,211
Hit harder why don't you?

265
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,506
Continue watching Councilor Jeong.

266
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,174
Yes, Your Highness.

267
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,302
Hyemyeong.

268
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,308
Prince.

269
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,728
What brings you here this late at night?

270
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,064
I missed you.

271
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,031
I heard the Prince of Qing's
mother is from Joseon.

272
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,491
Did you know?

273
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,742
Really?

274
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,707
He wants someone like
his mother to be his wife.

275
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,418
That's why he has been
wanting to marry a Joseon woman.

276
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,255
How did you know?

277
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,756
He told me himself.

278
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,803
He does not seem like a bad person.

279
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,557
Right, he is nice.

280
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,100
So,

281
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,061
do not worry about your sister now.

282
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,604
Still, I

283
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
like Master Gyeon more.

284
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,486
Can't you marry Master Gyeon?

285
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,198
I want you to marry him.

286
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,200
Then you will not have to go to Qing.

287
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,702
-And--
-Prince.

288
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,624
Okay.

289
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,103
If I turned down the invitation
I probably would have regretted it.

290
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,108
They said Qing
suggested the royal marriage.

291
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,365
He came to Joseon several times
as a messenger.

292
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,408
So of course they are close.

293
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,326
Do not go.

294
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,579
Do not go.

295
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,837
Gyeon U, are you awake?

296
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,218
Son.

297
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,681
Gyeon U.

298
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,392
Gyeon U.

299
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,893
Gyeon U.

300
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,313
Son, are you okay?

301
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
Yes, I am okay.

302
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,654
You look so pale.

303
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,781
Should we call a shaman?

304
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,872
Your herbal tonics are not working well.

305
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,916
You have been having nightmares, right?

306
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,379
-What is this about?
-Stop talking nonsense.

307
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,258
Look at all this sweat.

308
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,886
Do not worry.

309
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,263
What should we do?

310
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,735
Gyeon U has been acting
strangely these days.

311
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,490
He keeps having nightmares.

312
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,285
Like then.

313
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,588
What about Master Gyeon?

314
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,640
I will leave if you have nothing to say.

315
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,058
I have

316
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,893
something to say.

317
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,817
I guess

318
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,611
you know already.

319
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,032
-About how I feel about you.
-I have no feelings for you.

320
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,787
I believe it is rude not to turn you down
when I have no feelings for you.

321
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,665
Goodbye.

322
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,300
-Is it because of Gyeon U?
-What are you doing?

323
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,969
I asked you if it is because of him.

324
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,643
I'm not obligated to answer

325
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,104
such a question.

326
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,711
Say it with your eyes closed.

327
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,090
What is it?

328
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,843
Well... I...

329
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,721
like you.

330
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,056
Lie?

331
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,019
-No. I said "Like"!
-Like what?

332
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,868
Me?

333
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,497
I fell in love with you at first sight.

334
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,125
You are so handsome.

335
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,794
She says he is handsome.

336
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,588
Se-ho is?

337
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,846
Gosh.

338
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,766
Goodness. Well...

339
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,935
She cannot just leave like this.

340
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,647
She made my heart flutter.

341
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,942
Wait.

342
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,027
Wait.

343
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,738
Stop.

344
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,406
Hey!

345
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,617
What is going on?

346
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,452
You started this so you should...

347
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,456
I have a feeling

348
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,541
that something will happen.

349
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:44,462
That punk will finally get
to date someone.

350
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,611
Hello.

351
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,989
Is the Prince of Qing inside?

352
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,992
Yes, he is.

353
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,207
We are leaving as we are busy
preparing for the banquet.

354
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,578
Do you want to spar with me?

355
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,531
I won.

356
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,136
You mean in Joseon?

357
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,222
The request came through Eunuch Ju.

358
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,767
Then this visit is for...

359
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,937
I thought I was invited here by you guys.

360
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,694
What is it?

361
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,281
It's nothing.

362
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,923
You keep it.

363
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,772
I do not deserve to keep that ring.

364
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,778
Father.

365
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,743
I am sorry...

366
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,789
that I am such an incompetent father.

367
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,327
Do you have anything else
you want to have?

368
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,167
Lieutenant Gang.

369
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,297
Why are you outside?

370
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,927
Will you go buy it for me

371
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,971
if I tell you what I want to eat?

372
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,182
Anything.

373
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,142
Lieutenant Gang.

374
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,270
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,355
After I leave,

376
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,943
take good care of my brother.

377
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,949
-Your Highness.
-Help him

378
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,159
grow healthy and well

379
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,412
and become a great king.

380
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,041
I am sorry.

381
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,794
I always ask you for a favor.

382
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,129
I refuse.

383
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,969
You should do it yourself, Your Highness.

384
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,430
See it yourself.

385
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,058
I will make sure you can.

386
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,470
What are those?

387
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,349
They are wedding gifts sent from Qing.

388
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,434
Well...

389
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,229
What brings you here?

390
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,527
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

391
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,173
I heard you gave
a telescope to the Prince as a gift.

392
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,261
Thank you for being so considerate

393
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,637
of my little brother.

394
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,653
My goodness!

395
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,990
-Are you okay?
-Lieutenant Gang!

396
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,162
Do not be so stiff.

397
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,624
Thank you so much for your help last time.

398
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,084
That's it?

399
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,463
I shall repay you next time.

400
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:52,009
People never keep that promise, you see.

401
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,471
Sorry, I am in a hurry.

402
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,225
Wait.

403
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,232
You dropped this.

404
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,943
It does not belong to me.

405
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,277
Take it.

406
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,530
Or find its owner.

407
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,574
You work at the Office of
Investigation after all.

408
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,503
"The information is fake.

409
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,297
He will not appear."

410
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,675
What does this mean?

411
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,389
"On the last day of this month,

412
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,057
you will be able to see

413
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,477
the murderer of Min Yu-hwan
at the temple at 10 p.m."

414
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,364
The information is fake.

415
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,658
He will not appear.

416
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,619
What is wrong?

417
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,121
Nothing.

418
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,633
Look who it is.

419
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,470
Your Highness.

420
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,354
What are you doing?

421
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,190
You trained your dog poorly.

422
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,443
I caught this dog

423
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,654
sneaking around my house.

424
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,451
Why is your bodyguard spying on me?

425
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,374
Seeing how you cannot answer,

426
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,168
there must not be a fair reason.

427
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,628
Then...

428
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,927
what should I do with this wench?

429
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,524
I apologize.

430
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,527
Release her.

431
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,363
I do not wish to make
a big deal out of this either.

432
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,877
Let us say you owe me a huge debt.

433
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,504
I will consider

434
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,591
the debt paid

435
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,343
if you go to Qing without making a scene.

436
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,066
My apologies. Your Highness.

437
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,694
Cheer up, Your Highness.

438
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,200
I am sorry.

439
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,372
I

440
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,792
put you in danger.

441
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,836
Your Highness.

442
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,716
Now, I do not have...

443
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,345
anything I can protect.

444
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:47,930
Your Highness.

445
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,376
Tailed?

446
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,587
Lieutenant Gang tailed Wol-myeong.

447
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,006
He must be watching me.

448
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,341
Then

449
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,761
our exchange could be risky.

450
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,055
They say to strike from the west

451
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,850
after causing noise in the east.

452
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,770
Strike the west while
causing noise in the east?

453
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,439
Give false information to
the Office of Investigation

454
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,899
saying that Wol-myeong appeared.

455
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,376
Thanks to you, our transaction
is complete.

456
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,880
Thank you for suggesting a great deal.

457
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,716
Thank you. Let us drink!

458
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,553
Thief!

459
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,018
Thief! Thief!

460
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,774
You thief. Give that back right now!

461
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,656
-What is this?
-Get him!

462
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,500
-Get him!
-Stop!

463
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,585
Stop!

464
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,899
You have a lot of nerve.

465
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,901
You dared to rob my house.

466
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,073
It is not a big deal. Please do not worry.

467
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,619
Do not make a fuss,

468
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,663
and send him to the government office.

469
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,790
We sent someone to report him already.

470
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,627
Put those away!

471
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,753
Yes, my lord.

472
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,756
Stop.

473
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,182
I received a report and
came to investigate.

474
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,146
There was no need for you to come.
He's just a petty thief.

475
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,524
Go back. I will take care of it myself.

476
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,109
He does not seem like a petty thief.

477
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,193
What?

478
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:33,739
-What are you talking about?
-I shall answer you.

479
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,268
Where are all these going to?

480
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,562
They are going to the Minister
of Taxation's house.

481
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,733
Once we get the ginseng,
we will divide it equally.

482
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,903
Take good care of it today.

483
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,162
There is some kind of transaction going on

484
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,997
using this marriage as an excuse.

485
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,627
What do you mean?

486
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,253
Something was secretly delivered to

487
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,799
the Minister of Taxation's house today.

488
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,779
Rhinoceros horns are piled
up in the storage room.

489
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,908
It cannot be found in Joseon.

490
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,244
How do you have so many of them?

491
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,122
The top is covered in silk,

492
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,625
so it seems like they are trying
to hide the contents.

493
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,005
Were they declared?

494
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,927
It is not the matter of paying taxes.

495
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,263
Rhinoceros horn is the ingredient
for making bows.

496
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,058
Bringing a lot of them in secret

497
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,601
could be

498
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,772
an evidence of treason.

499
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,941
Treason?

500
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,901
That is out of the question!

501
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,363
You would have to explain
in detail during the investigation.

502
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,365
-Arrest him.
-Yes, sir.

503
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,158
How dare you!

504
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,036
Let go!

505
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,205
Let go of me!

506
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,918
There are two parties involved.

507
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,880
We cannot just let the other one
walk away.

508
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,216
I am the envoy from Qing.

509
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:01,678
Do you really think you can arrest me?

510
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,221
The Qing dynasty will not forgive

511
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,348
your sins.

512
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,311
-Arrest him too.
-Yes, sir.

513
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,694
Let go!

514
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,000
What do you mean things went sideways?

515
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,127
Master Gyeon broke into his house

516
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,837
and found the horns.

517
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,214
Then Lieutenant Gang barged in.

518
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,467
So they were arrested right away.

519
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,929
They even mentioned
the possibility for treason.

520
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,430
What if we...

521
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,807
We?

522
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,394
The Minister of Taxation plotted
the treason himself.

523
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,771
Pardon?

524
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,067
Before he opens his mouth,

525
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,735
seal it.

526
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,373
Princess,

527
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,377
will you marry me?

528
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,892
What is it?

529
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,562
-Master Gyeon.
-Gyeon U.

530
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,524
I cannot translate that.

531
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,528
I cannot

532
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,239
translate that.

533
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,256
Prince of Qing.

534
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,904
Master Gyeon caught a secret transaction?

535
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,865
The Minister of Taxation and
the envoy from Qing were arrested.

536
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,036
He caught them dealing on the side,
using the marriage as an excuse.

537
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:58,373
Maybe he tried to stop the marriage.

538
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,503
I did not know any of this.

539
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,338
Is he hurt?

540
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,756
I do not know.

541
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,800
He disguised himself as a thief
and sneaked in alone.

542
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,845
Oh, no. He might be injured badly.

543
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,895
-It is too late now.
-Your Highness.

544
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,082
Are you okay?

545
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,959
Are you not hurt?

546
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,505
Were you worried about me?

547
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,342
You said not to mind you.

548
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,137
Then why did you worry about me?

549
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,473
You said not to care about you.

550
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,017
Then why are you looking at me
with such teary eyes?

551
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,147
Are you sure...

552
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,358
you do not want me to mind you,

553
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,277
to care about you,

554
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,113
and to be around you?

555
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,038
I cannot do that.

556
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,375
I will care about you.

557
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,170
I will mind you.

558
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,299
And I will protect you.

559
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,647
I know I am crossing the line

560
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,691
but I cannot help it.

561
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,361
Please question the criminal yourself.

562
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,613
There may be accomplices.

563
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,448
You were reinstated
as the Prince's teacher?

564
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,576
Now, I can see you more.

565
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,120
I think you can't have
Master Gyeon. Give up on him.

566
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,289
Whatever the reason for
you going outside the palace is,

567
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,291
show people your dignity and
behavior as the Princess.

568
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,293
I do not want you to be in danger

569
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,086
or to get along with the Princess either.

570
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,713
He got caught for committing treason.

571
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,465
You really did not know about it?

572
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,552
You seem to be curious about
too many things, Your Highness.

573
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,054
I cannot just sit back
and wait to be attacked.

574
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,683
Is there any way
to bring down Jeong Gi-jun?

575
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,688
