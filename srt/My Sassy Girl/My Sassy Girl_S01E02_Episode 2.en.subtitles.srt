TOP BOOKS OF THE MONTH

2
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,580
Do you have Lover From The Star

3
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,000
and Secrets of the female transvestite
of Sungkyunkwan available right now?

4
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,960
Someone already rented it.

5
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,087
They are
the most popular books these days.

6
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,630
By the way,

7
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,509
your hands are very beautiful.

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,721
I would love to paint your hand
on my canvas.

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,222
Could you lift your garment...

10
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,641
My goodness, Master Gyeon U.

11
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,854
You are here.

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,106
-Are the guys here?
-Of course.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,658
This is the place.

14
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,757
Goodness.

15
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,931
Love? Nonsense.

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,141
I will buy you with money.

17
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,061
How much will it cost? How much?

18
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,271
How much can you give me?

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,278
You idiots.

20
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,030
What are you doing?

21
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,077
This is the secret to our teamwork.

22
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,171
Gosh, I thought...

23
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,257
Why did you throw that?

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,344
Did you think we were interested in men?

25
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,389
I love women. I really love women.

26
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,976
-And me--
-Stop it, it is over.

27
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,728
I have a favor to ask.

28
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,021
What is it?

29
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,156
All right. I am finished.

30
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,825
How does it look?

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,666
Who is this? She is absolutely beautiful.

32
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,670
Is this your new lover?

33
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,799
She is not my lover. She is my enemy.

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,925
Your enemy?

35
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,429
She will go from your enemy to friend

36
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,973
and then friend to lover. That is life.

37
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,145
Anyway, please let me know
if you find this enemy of yours.

38
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,690
Where else will you find
an enemy like this?

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,859
He is at it again.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,155
Have you seen this woman?

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,159
I do not know. I am not sure.

42
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,287
-Okay.
-All right.

43
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,126
Have you seen this woman?

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,128
-Who is it?
-I am not sure.

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,465
I have not seen her.

46
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,929
Are you all right?

47
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,473
Gyeon U?

48
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,142
Do you know me?

49
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,354
It is me, Da-yeon.

50
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,982
Right, Da-yeon.

51
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,454
-Are you ready to order?
-I will take this.

52
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,124
What is this tea?

53
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,173
Let me know when you are ready.

54
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,810
Drink it when
the flower blooms completely.

55
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,858
I heard your study
in Yanjing was a big success.

56
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,861
They all considered me
as Joseon's representative,

57
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,362
so, I just tried harder.

58
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,532
I heard His Majesty
asked you to return home.

59
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,452
Now that the best bachelor
of Joseon is back,

60
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,954
matchmakers must be going crazy.

61
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,042
I am not ready to get married yet.

62
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,504
First, I must work hard to achieve
the peace of this country.

63
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,886
There must be women everywhere
waiting for you.

64
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,305
But I can never be sure.

65
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,434
If I ever come across a woman
who moves my heart,

66
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,895
I am willing to throw

67
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,356
my dreams away to live just for her.

68
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,195
I really wonder...

69
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,364
who that lucky woman will be.

70
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,941
It is you.

71
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,945
You returned here on your own.

72
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,363
I was wondering where you were.

73
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,491
Why? Are you trying to be a pervert again?

74
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,284
A pervert?

75
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,661
He must be a pervert.

76
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,205
-What? He looks so normal.
-That is gross.

77
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,626
Don't start with me
when you're the one who's done wrong!

78
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,753
I saved you
when you were completely drunk.

79
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,255
Stop lying.

80
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,257
When I was drunk and unconscious,

81
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,425
you tried to rape me at a motel.

82
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,594
-What?
-Rape her?

83
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,306
-But he is so handsome.
-What an awful man.

84
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,183
He looks so normal.

85
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,977
You should lower your voice.

86
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,062
Mind your own business.

87
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,940
I apologize, Da-yeon.

88
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,525
You should be apologizing to me.

89
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,360
You know, I can't let you off forever.

90
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,863
Defamation is a serious crime.

91
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,156
That night,

92
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,243
you took something
that means more than life to me.

93
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,036
That man is shameless.

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,290
-Oh, my goodness.
-That is unbelievable.

95
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,544
-How can this be?
-I am at a loss for words.

96
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,172
-Gosh.
-He is disgusting.

97
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,259
Excuse me. I must go for today.

98
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,012
Follow me.

99
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,432
Look at him.

100
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,602
What an awful man.

101
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,483
Do you humiliate people in public

102
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,610
to take money from them?

103
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,236
You have got the wrong man.

104
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,365
I am not the type
who would fall for threats.

105
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,909
Give it to me.

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,287
Now you are showing your true colors.

107
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,122
Let us go to the police.

108
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,583
Stop joking and give me back my jade ring.

109
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,959
Your jade ring?

110
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,059
Wait, so that jade ring was...

111
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,145
Now we are talking.

112
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,232
Did you make a scene because of that ring?

113
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,692
-Where is my jade ring?
-First, apologize.

114
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,694
Why would I apologize to a thief?

115
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,613
"A thief"?

116
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,114
If not, give it back.

117
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,659
First you accuse me of rape
and now of theft?

118
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,578
I will give you back
your darn jade ring right...

119
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,593
I will kill you if you are
trying to pull something.

120
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,429
Give me a moment.

121
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,434
You said you had it.

122
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,354
If you do not find my jade ring,

123
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,440
I will write "rapist" on your face
and send you on an exile.

124
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,608
Understood?

125
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,987
Rape?

126
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
I trusted you and treasured you.

127
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,577
How could you disappoint me?

128
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,706
I am falsely accused, Your Majesty.

129
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,500
You're not even sorry.
You're not accepting your mistake.

130
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,712
Guards. Take this man away.

131
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,255
-Yes.
-Yes.

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,382
Your Majesty, I am being framed.

133
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,552
Your Majesty.

134
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,725
Oh, my goodness.

135
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,186
What are you doing?

136
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,108
I was just thinking about some things.

137
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,569
Now do you remember where it is?

138
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,695
Let us

139
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,780
call it even.

140
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,575
-What?
-I also had

141
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,328
something I must retrieve from you.

142
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,579
What is it?

143
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,794
My shattered honor

144
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,379
and pride.

145
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,177
I think you have the better end
of the deal,

146
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,554
but making problems bigger
isn't good for both of us.

147
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,473
So, let us call it even.

148
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,602
What a load of crap!

149
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,730
Give it back immediately
or I will take you to the Police Bureau.

150
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,191
Fine.

151
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,360
Since the ring is so important to you,

152
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,488
it would not be right
for a nobleman to turn--

153
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,906
Hey, wait.

154
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,454
Oh, hello. Welcome.

155
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,582
You two are here again.

156
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,210
You look sober.

157
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,837
Are you here for a room?

158
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,340
We came to look for something.

159
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,218
Have you seen a ring with lovebirds?

160
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,762
If I found something like that,
I would have traded it for money.

161
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,222
It would not be around anymore.

162
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,726
Is it expensive?

163
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,436
Show me the room we were in.

164
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,648
No I can't. I have customers there.

165
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,276
-Excuse me, you cannot go.
-Gosh.

166
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,821
Meow.

167
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,331
Open up.

168
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,959
-Just rip it.
-It will not open.

169
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,636
Goodness, what is with you?

170
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,888
You are ruining my business.

171
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,599
What is going on?

172
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,684
I am sorry.

173
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:11,647
I told them the room is taken,
but they just barged in.

174
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,731
My gosh.

175
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,692
We will find it later. Let us go.

176
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,571
You don't deserve to say that.

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,658
You. Have you seen a jade ring here?

178
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,370
I have not.

179
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,832
What about you?

180
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,631
Something smells fishy.

181
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:39,800
Something.

182
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,679
Smell? What smell?

183
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,391
I wonder what the rush was.

184
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,310
Your socks are still on.

185
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,572
You two.

186
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,532
You are not a married couple, are you?

187
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,956
Let us go.

188
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,753
Sir, please.

189
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,714
Sir. My goodness.

190
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,258
You should be ashamed.

191
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,303
I will finish you two
if I ever see you again.

192
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,722
I will end you. Darn you.

193
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,439
Darn it.

194
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,609
Gosh.

195
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,032
Where do you think you're going?

196
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,539
You plan to go through
every single one in this pile?

197
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,750
Of course. Find it.

198
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,546
Goodness.

199
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,589
Would it be here?

200
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,261
Are you here to shop?

201
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,264
I was about to look for it.

202
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,437
Show more enthusiasm, like this!

203
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
Okay, enthusiasm.

204
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,400
I will be more enthusiastic.

205
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,928
Follow me.

206
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,629
I came across Gyeon U on the streets.

207
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,051
He was with his girlfriend.

208
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,055
Girlfriend? Gosh, never.

209
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,973
He just returned home.

210
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,808
Really?

211
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,606
Da-yeon.

212
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,817
What do you think about Gyeon U?

213
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,530
I wish I could be your sister-in-law.

214
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,994
There are many ladies
lined up for Gyeon U.

215
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,913
They are all like empty grains.

216
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,457
You have got a great family and looks.

217
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,835
Gyeon U will need
someone as qualified as you.

218
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,388
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

219
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,015
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

220
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,522
Is it so wrong to revive sinmungo?

221
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,983
Is it really wrong for me to want to hear

222
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,943
from the people themselves?

223
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,862
Your Majesty, we discontinued it

224
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,907
because it did more harm than good.

225
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,034
Those ignorant peasants

226
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,911
hit the drum so often,

227
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,497
the officials could not even work.

228
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,790
That is not all.

229
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,710
Most of their stories were
petty and trivial.

230
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,712
It was just a waste of time.

231
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,756
It may be petty to us,

232
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,009
but it may be a matter
of life and death for them.

233
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,845
Our offices are taking
good care of the people.

234
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,597
Trust us and do not worry.

235
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,018
Then

236
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,647
should I just go around hunting

237
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,941
and sit around idly?

238
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,369
Your Majesty,
that is not what we meant. We--

239
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,079
If that is what you all wish,

240
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,916
I will do that.

241
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,509
He declined it
when we suggested hunting before.

242
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,512
What is he up to?

243
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,057
He is not actually going hunting.

244
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,770
He will visit the people
as he comes and goes.

245
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,106
He was quite for a while,
but he is at it again.

246
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,235
Recently, His Majesty is
trying hard to think for himself.

247
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,738
Chief Scholar Gyeon is the problem.

248
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,949
He keeps on bringing up
unnecessary subjects to him.

249
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,869
I must let His Majesty know again.

250
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,080
If he continues to do this,

251
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,793
he will lose something important again.

252
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
It is not here.

253
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,140
Are you sure you looked carefully?
Did you look thoroughly?

254
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,018
If you are not sure, you can check.

255
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,157
Let us grab something to eat.

256
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,869
We must eat first.
We need energy to find the ring.

257
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,877
Do you think I am in the mood
to eat right now?

258
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,635
That hit the spot.

259
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,323
Why are you just sitting there?

260
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,119
Where is the lady
who did not feel like eating?

261
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,414
Where is the gentleman
who insisted on us eating?

262
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,750
I am all right. You can have it all.

263
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,086
Do you loathe fermented skate?

264
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,796
Do you know how good this is?

265
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,923
One must associate only with good people

266
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,800
and have only good food.

267
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,219
Really? Here is a treat for you.

268
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,608
Here. Eat it.

269
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,362
Oh, right. About the jade ring...

270
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,749
How is it? Is it not wonderful?

271
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,962
There are people starving to death.

272
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,089
Will you throw that away?

273
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:24,723
I guarantee that you will start
to crave this even in your sleep.

274
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,355
I cannot take this anymore.

275
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,442
I saved you from falling off the bridge

276
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,986
and I saved you from the palanquin guys,

277
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,156
but you never even thanked me.
You have been nothing but rude.

278
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,118
What about my jade ring?

279
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,374
I think I have done
more than enough. I'll get going.

280
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,001
I hope you find your jade ring.

281
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:13,855
If you cannot find my jade ring,
you will be done and over with.

282
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,942
Gosh, where is your home?

283
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,861
We are spinning around in circles.

284
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,446
You!

285
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,243
If you try something funny again,
I will end you.

286
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,955
Why are you speaking so casually to me?

287
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,207
If you feel it's unfair,
you can do it too.

288
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,126
That is not what I meant--

289
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,296
-Let us go. Giddy up.
-Wait.

290
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,964
-Giddy up.
-Wait, that hurts.

291
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,008
-My gosh.
-Faster.

292
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,010
-Run.
-That hurts.

293
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,857
I thought your house was this way.

294
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,328
Goodness.

295
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,146
Gosh. Whatever.
I would love to leave you here.

296
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,942
Hey, you.

297
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,989
JADE RING

298
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,409
Which gold digger got to you this time?

299
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,578
-Gold digger?
-Whoever it is,

300
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,081
she has got a great handwriting.

301
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,499
What is he saying?

302
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,220
Damn it!

303
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,142
What is this?

304
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,144
My goodness.

305
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,542
THE PRINCESS SNEAKS OUT AGAIN

306
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,255
I am sure these are
not just simple rumors.

307
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,133
Look into it.

308
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:32,137
Find out who is making these
and why that person is making it.

309
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,181
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,421
Princess.

311
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,307
Father.

312
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,358
It did not look like
this was your first time.

313
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,571
Were the rumors of you sneaking out true?

314
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
I apologize.

315
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,460
It seems like I have overindulged you.

316
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,509
From now on, I will teach you

317
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,429
the strict customs of this palace.

318
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,311
What?

319
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:07,357
He told her to recite and copy down
the Instructions For Women 100 times?

320
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,735
Is that everything
he gave as a punishment?

321
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,997
This is all because of him.

322
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,417
Who are you talking about?

323
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,128
Why do you ask? The crazed pervert.

324
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,422
Things went wrong because of him.

325
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,384
If you think about it,
it is not because of him.

326
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,678
It is not like this is
the first time you sneaked out.

327
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,805
The one who lost the jade ring is--

328
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,348
Why?

329
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,146
Yes, you are right, Yeong-sin.

330
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,524
It is all because of me.
Yes, everything is my fault.

331
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,359
A princess should not drink.

332
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,278
A princess should not sneak out.

333
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,488
A princess should not do that.

334
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,283
I am sorry. I am so sorry. I apologize.

335
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,617
Princess.

336
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,289
Princess, I did not mean
to come off like that.

337
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,127
Byeol will make sure
she finds the jade ring.

338
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,384
Where on earth could it be?

339
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,554
Wait, maybe he pocketed it.

340
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,267
Yes, he might have deceived me.

341
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,105
I hope to never see her again.

342
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,484
Gosh.

343
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,079
Goodness.

344
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,880
"Listen to your father
when you live with your parents.

345
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,133
After you get married,
listen to your husband.

346
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,136
Once he dies, listen to your son

347
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,306
and make sure to not make
any decisions yourself."

348
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,559
What? Do women have no brains?

349
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,561
Why can we not do anything by ourselves?

350
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,318
This is so old and makes no sense.

351
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,322
Just memorize it.

352
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,326
When will you finish this?

353
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,662
We can copy this for you, but memorizing--

354
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,249
Byeol, you have been
looking after me for years now.

355
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,751
Is this the best you can do?

356
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,628
You should learn from Yeong-sin.

357
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,632
Hey, I told you that you should study.

358
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,344
Yeong-sin, this is wrong.
Stay on the top of it.

359
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,888
All rise for the King.

360
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,477
-The King? My father?
-The King?

361
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,814
Put everything away.

362
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,774
Okay, now.

363
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,652
Hey. Put that away.

364
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,447
This one.

365
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,666
Princess, I hope you are not slacking off.

366
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,792
No...

367
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,256
You little...

368
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,341
-My goodness.
-Come here.

369
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,635
-Prince.
-Come here.

370
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,429
-I got you.
-I am sorry.

371
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,930
-Come here.
-I am sorry.

372
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,557
Stop it.

373
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,185
-My pretty sister.
-Pretty?

374
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,270
Should I let him off? No, I will not.

375
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,730
Stop.

376
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,901
Princess.

377
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,446
My King.

378
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,532
Just forgive her.

379
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,911
Are you not glad how loving they are?

380
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,913
Recently, the Royal Court has been

381
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,708
trying to undermine the Royal Family.

382
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,796
I am afraid the Prince may
turn out reckless like the Princess.

383
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,340
I am worried.

384
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,717
People say

385
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:07,722
the more their parents love them
the greater they become.

386
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,644
I am just thankful to see
how warm-hearted she is

387
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,479
even after all that she has been through.

388
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,969
Are you coming home now, Father?

389
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,388
Where are you going all dressed up?

390
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,558
There is something I desire.

391
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,436
You must like it a lot.

392
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,660
I apologize for what happened last time.

393
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,788
I hope there was no misunderstanding.

394
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,624
Misunderstanding?

395
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,502
How can you be a crazy pervert?

396
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,630
If that were true, the entire nation
of Joseon would already know.

397
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,508
Thank you for understanding.

398
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,556
So, who was that lady?

399
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,058
It did not look like
she was a stranger to you.

400
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,437
Oh, well...

401
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,902
She was an obsessed stalker.

402
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,655
"An obsessed stalker"?

403
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,781
Yes.

404
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,869
Are you talking about a lady

405
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,873
who would do anything
to get a man she wants?

406
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:01,502
Yes. She was really tenacious.
It has been difficult.

407
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,630
You should have reported her.

408
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,382
Who knows what else she could do?

409
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,426
I took care of her already.

410
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,472
I am sure I will never ever...

411
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,642
have to see her again.

412
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,830
Goodness, there is no way out.

413
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,208
I have to find him quickly

414
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,502
before he runs away.

415
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,630
You should give up for the time being.

416
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,800
Princess.

417
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,470
Princess.

418
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,683
You idiot.

419
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,811
Princess, why are you still here?

420
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,938
Have you forgotten about today?

421
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,483
Today? What is it?

422
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,203
I appoint you as a special teacher

423
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,831
to teach the Prince.

424
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,709
Teach the Royal Line of this country

425
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,463
to become a great king
with your excellent knowledge and wisdom.

426
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,216
I will do my best.

427
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,972
Prince, show courtesy to your master.

428
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,530
Hello, Master Gyeon.

429
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,769
Do you think I will get a chance

430
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,021
to go and see the world like you?

431
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,231
You will have such a chance.

432
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,527
Until then, I will tell you
about what I have seen and heard.

433
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,030
My sister loves to hear
about new things too.

434
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,282
She could be a good friend to you.

435
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,161
You and the Princess must be close.

436
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,209
Prince.

437
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,922
Hyemyeong.

438
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,760
Master Gyeon, this is my sister.

439
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,099
Is this the master
who Father has invited just for you?

440
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,770
Nice to meet you. I am Princess Hyemyeong.

441
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,146
I am Gyeon U.

442
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,158
The crazy...

443
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:21,911
The gold digger...

444
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,164
Princess, do you know him?

445
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:31,129
I am not sure.
I think I have seen him before.

446
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,175
She seems familiar to me too.

447
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:43,808
I heard there is a shameless fellow
who is harassing women every night.

448
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,686
He looks very much like him.

449
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,604
-Is that right, Byeol?
-Pardon?

450
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,815
Yes, Princess.

451
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,359
What? Is he that pervert?

452
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,113
Princess, you are being ridiculous.

453
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,116
I am sure the Princess is mistaken.

454
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,827
Why would His Majesty bring

455
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,913
someone like him
as the master to the Prince?

456
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,132
How can he put Gyeon Pil-hyeong's son

457
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,092
to raise our next king?

458
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,388
Why didn't he discuss this
with Second State Councilor Jeong?

459
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,807
Recently, His Majesty has been showing...

460
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,228
alarming signs.

461
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,866
Bull's eye.

462
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,869
I am worried

463
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,371
about how they will react.

464
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,418
Many things have changed since that time.

465
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,174
Hitting the bull's eye isn't everything.

466
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,929
If you can draw the bow,

467
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,765
it is still meaningful.

468
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,644
Bull's eye.

469
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,406
You are very handsome.

470
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,869
Master Gyeon, who is your ideal type?

471
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,996
My ideal type?

472
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,875
A type of a woman
you would like to have as a wife.

473
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,878
You can tell me.

474
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,421
Who knows?

475
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,924
I might set you up with someone.

476
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,762
I do not have anything in particular.

477
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,724
I would love to meet someone

478
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,726
who is gentle, modest,

479
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,145
graceful, elegant, refined

480
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,731
and gorgeous like the summer sun.

481
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,193
That is the opposite of my sister.

482
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,363
Isn't that right, Mother?

483
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,158
To me,

484
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,078
there is no one better than the Princess.

485
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,210
What?

486
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,134
Gosh.

487
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,469
That reckless gold digger is the Princess?

488
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,054
Goodness.

489
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,723
Master Gyeon.

490
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,231
Were you shocked that I am a princess?

491
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,069
I was just thrown off to see the Princess

492
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,449
acting recklessly outside of these walls.

493
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,534
Now that you know who I am,

494
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,162
do you want to give back my jade ring?

495
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,458
It sounds like you're suspecting me
of hiding your jade ring.

496
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,546
That sounds like you're claiming
you do not have it.

497
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,885
Master Gyeon,
I must look like a joke to you.

498
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,514
You do not look like a joke.
It is the truth.

499
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,811
If you do not find that jade ring,

500
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,982
your life here
will become a life of misery.

501
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,361
I wanted to save your face,

502
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,364
so, I restrained myself
in front of Grandma.

503
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,408
But I do have a loose tongue.

504
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,911
I am not sure when I will spill it.

505
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,291
If my father finds out who you truly are,

506
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,252
he will be really disappointed.

507
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,504
Just thinking about it

508
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,507
makes me feel so sad.

509
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,140
Let us go and see His Majesty right now.

510
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,601
Wait, what?

511
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,480
Does His Majesty know all about you?

512
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,482
How you walk about in drunkenness

513
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,443
threatening people, being violent.

514
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,904
Are you...

515
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,906
Are you trying to fight me?

516
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,616
You should speak like a Princess.

517
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,993
Please excuse me.

518
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:16,872
Hey!

519
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:27,425
It looked like you have found
a great man of talent.

520
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,927
I love him.

521
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,679
Me too.

522
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,100
The Prince
will finally feel like studying.

523
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,602
Now that he has a great Master,

524
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,148
it is about time we proclaim him
as the Crown Prince.

525
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,153
As the Crown Prince?

526
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,421
-Your Highness.
-This is absolutely no use.

527
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,965
There is no use in getting pregnant

528
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,050
if he crowns him as the Crown Prince.

529
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,638
Lower your voice.

530
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,615
You are here.

531
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,284
I told you to be cautious.
Why are you making a scene?

532
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,036
He will crown the Prince.

533
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,121
-You knew it was coming.
-Councilor Jeong.

534
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,999
It would have been the best
if you had a son,

535
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,209
but this is how it is.

536
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,879
His Majesty is avoiding me. What can I do?

537
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,424
You said you were confident
of winning his heart.

538
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,057
The Prince believes
that you're his biological mother.

539
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,726
Even if he is crowned,
nothing will change.

540
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,645
However,

541
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,482
-if the Princess says anything--
-Find an excuse.

542
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,442
Get her married or kick her out.

543
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,737
All you have to do is
pluck out that thorn.

544
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,246
Princess, are you sure

545
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,248
Master Gyeon tried to rape you?

546
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,167
He is way too perfect
to be a crazy pervert.

547
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,460
Perfect?

548
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,506
I saw him trying to undo my shirt
with my own two eyes.

549
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,008
How can he be the Prince's master?

550
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,761
Maybe he tried to wipe
something off of your shirt.

551
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,263
Don't you think?

552
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,060
Are you two taking that pervert's side?

553
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,523
Well, I just can't believe it.

554
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,651
He is so handsome and normal to...

555
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:55,322
Do perverts have "pervert"
written across their faces?

556
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,255
You became the Prince's Master.
That is amazing.

557
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,174
It is just a humble beginning.

558
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,428
Anyway, have you met the Princess?

559
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,513
The Princess?

560
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:24,435
I heard she is more beautiful
than any beauty of this world

561
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,729
and that she is really kind at heart.

562
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,441
She is a woman who captured
every man's heart in Joseon.

563
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:36,363
I hope someday to grab
just one glimpse of her.

564
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,157
That is all I wish for.

565
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,366
Kind at heart?

566
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,578
This is why rumors are scary.

567
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,749
There are rumors

568
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,795
that she is actually
impudent and reckless.

569
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,591
Master Gyeon.

570
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,636
What is it?

571
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,722
I have a present to congratulate you
on your new job.

572
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,685
What is it?

573
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,189
It's a Jirashi.

574
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:13,776
It's like a flyer that lets you know about
secrets on the streets and in the palace.

575
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,864
The Princess appears
very often on these flyers.

576
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,868
-It is harder to hear this.
-I am scared.

577
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,594
What is with the food?
They are the same as yesterday.

578
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,471
There is nothing to eat.

579
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,559
Princess.
People are starving outside of...

580
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,939
Starving? What is that?

581
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,859
Oh, they have no rice.

582
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,739
Then they can eat meat.

583
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,245
Hey, this is too salty.

584
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,579
What are you looking at?

585
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,498
ILL-MANNERED

586
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,890
Your muscles look great.

587
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,397
You are so perfect.

588
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,149
You.

589
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,443
You and you.

590
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,237
-Follow me.
-Princess.

591
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,322
What about him?

592
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,200
Bring him.

593
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,369
OBSCENE AND WILD

594
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,791
I love the weather

595
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,877
and the view.

596
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,422
This is what I love
about being a Princess.

597
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,263
Hey, bring me more peanuts.

598
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,516
Princess, that was

599
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,269
the last peanut.

600
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,479
What?

601
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,982
Just kill me, Princess.
I have committed a mortal sin.

602
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,526
Do you not know that...

603
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,529
my hands shake like this

604
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,698
if I don't eat peanuts?

605
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,995
Turn the palanquin back. Hurry.

606
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,706
-Pardon?
-Bring more peanuts.

607
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,790
Right now.

608
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,295
We are returning to the palace.

609
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,006
We are returning to the palace.

610
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,884
We are returning to the palace.

611
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,801
What?

612
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,513
-The other way.
-Turn it around.

613
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,389
Turn it around.

614
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,558
-Turn around.
-To the palace.

615
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,685
ABUSING HER POWER

616
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,687
OBSCENE AND WILD

617
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,817
No one in the palace
who crossed the Princess...

618
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,698
Has survived. Be careful.

619
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,661
Get on her bad side, you are dead.

620
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,298
Goodness.

621
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,885
Does His Majesty know all about you?

622
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,971
How you walk about in drunkenness

623
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,723
threatening people, being violent.

624
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,353
My gosh.

625
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,357
I should not have said that.

626
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,943
Anyway,

627
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,696
what is so special about that ring?

628
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,407
Why is she so obsessed with it?

629
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,832
Please keep this safe with you.

630
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,704
Get out, bad luck.

631
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,999
Why the red beans?

632
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,003
It is your first day,
so it is for good luck.

633
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,673
-We are chasing away bad luck.
-Did it hurt?

634
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,550
I know you do not like superstition.

635
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,055
Okay. Throw it at me.

636
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,519
What? Okay.

637
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,853
Get out, bad luck.

638
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,483
-Get out, bad luck.
-What are you doing?

639
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,116
Farmers worked hard for those--

640
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,868
Fine. Sure.

641
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,495
Sure, okay.

642
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,667
Goodness.

643
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,002
He needs to do this.

644
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,798
He has to do the last step, Father.

645
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,801
All right.

646
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,973
Step on this to wish for all to go well.

647
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,315
I WANT TO KEEP YOU HERE
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES

648
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,235
Is this really
the Qing Emperor's handwriting?

649
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,029
Do you see the seal at the bottom?

650
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,868
"I want to keep you here
no matter what it takes."

651
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,912
You are amazing, Master.

652
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,250
There is a huge Joseon wave
in the Qing Dynasty right now.

653
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,877
Joseon wave?

654
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,296
Customs, songs, dances,

655
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,090
even clothes and food
of Joseon are in style.

656
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,010
Many of them want to learn
more about Joseon.

657
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:01,349
I will not say that it is
necessarily because of me.

658
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,980
Stop boasting.

659
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,817
Hyemyeong.

660
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,912
Prince, if you want to be a great king,

661
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:25,624
you should never be blinded
by the scholars' empty boast.

662
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,210
Is that right, Master Gyeon?

663
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,757
It is also important to take in

664
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,926
advices from a scholar.

665
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:46,186
"I'm the Prince of Joseon."

666
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,231
"I'm the Prince of...

667
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,941
Prince of..."

668
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,111
"I'm the Prince of Joseon."

669
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,072
Have you eaten?

670
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,907
Hyemyeong.

671
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,244
Okay.

672
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,663
"I'm the Prince of--"

673
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,289
Have you eaten?

674
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,293
Prince, repeat after me.

675
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,838
"I'm the Prince of--"

676
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,840
Do you not understand?

677
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,174
Have you eaten?

678
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,218
Have you eaten?

679
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,803
Prince.

680
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,263
Have you...

681
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,973
Damn it...

682
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,225
Have you eaten?

683
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,810
Have you eaten?

684
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,270
Have you eaten?

685
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,197
Is she going to do that
until I find her ring?

686
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,158
Hey, you crazy pervert.

687
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,712
Where are your manners?

688
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,297
What should I call you?

689
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,799
Lady-killer? Master Obscene?

690
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,759
Or a player?

691
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,845
I will back down.

692
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,810
I will tell Lieutenant Gang
about how a pervert became

693
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,980
the Prince's master and get his help.

694
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:16,234
I suddenly miss Lieutenant Gang a lot.

695
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,903
Wait.

696
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,411
If I find your jade ring,

697
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,999
will you stop calling me
"the crazy pervert"?

698
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,003
Of course. I promise.

699
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,130
You promised.

700
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,223
Oh, my. Hello. Welcome.

701
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,936
This is a pawnshop run by

702
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,854
an infamous gang.

703
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,230
Is my ring there?

704
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,900
That is where smuggled goods
from the Qing Dynasty and Japan end up

705
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,861
and everything that is taken
illegally from people are

706
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,821
sold and bought.

707
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,115
If someone picked it up and sold it,

708
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,076
it will end up here.

709
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,994
These men are tough.

710
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,038
Be careful.

711
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,961
What are you doing? Come on.

712
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,053
It says right here that you will
pay back with interest until today.

713
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,473
The ledger does not lie.

714
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,061
If you give me another extension,
I will pay you back.

715
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,022
You're making me look like a bad guy

716
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:38,108
because you keep breaking your promise.

717
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,401
Please, spare me.

718
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,072
Boss, you have guests.

719
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:04,342
So, these were all smuggled,
stolen, taken away

720
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,095
or conned from people.

721
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,056
You are a funny lady.

722
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,933
You can take your time.

723
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,444
Take a closer look.

724
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,446
I can tell at once.

725
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,077
Bok-sun's dad,

726
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,038
interest of 420 bags of rice.

727
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,373
Ms. Naju, overdue interest of

728
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,125
190 yang.

729
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,170
Overdue interest is 50 yang per day.

730
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,963
-Let us go.
-Wait.

731
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,009
Do you have any golden hairpin too?

732
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,305
Why do you want to...

733
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,355
I am a little busy today. I have to go.

734
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,117
My ledger.

735
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,502
-Get them.
-Hey, run!

736
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,990
-Yes, boss.
-Boss.

737
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,452
They are broken.

738
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,454
Get them.

739
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,541
Stop right there.

740
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,546
Get them.

741
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,381
Stop them.

742
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,265
Darn you.

743
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,079
-Get them.
-Gosh.

744
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,957
Hey, there she is.

745
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,301
What is happening?

746
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,140
Get them.

747
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,017
Hey, wait right there.

748
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,560
Stop them.

749
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,067
Darn you.

750
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,301
Stop right there. I'll get you.

751
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,138
-Stop them.
-Move away.

752
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,681
Darn it.

753
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,017
My goodness.

754
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,063
Follow me.

755
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,244
Money.

756
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,246
-Money.
-Get the money.

757
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,127
-Get the money.
-Get it.

758
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,495
"I am a crazy and obsessive woman"!

759
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,914
I am not an easy guy.

760
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,333
I really hate women who are reckless

761
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,669
like foals.

762
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,421
I must take it back from you.

763
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,924
The Princess snuck out of
the palace again?

764
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,926
The night will be long.

765
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,553
You must not make a mistake.

766
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,638
The King will cry bitterly

767
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,473
after losing his child.

768
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,725
We must find the Princess.

769
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,393
My gosh, where in the world is she?

770
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,646
