1
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,705
Write a love letter as if the Queen
sent it to Prince Chuseong.

2
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,792
Write as if she is head over heels for
Prince Chuseong.

3
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,669
Refer the letter

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,130
I enclosed when copying
the Queen's handwriting.

5
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,716
Where did you...

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,969
Where did you get it?

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,264
My apologies, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,684
Everything started from my negligence.

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,108
What do you mean by that?

10
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,029
"The blind mother ruins everything."

11
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,449
Do you remember this sentence?

12
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,995
"The blind mother ruins..."

13
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,751
I...

14
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,713
I wrote it.

15
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,717
I wrote it and posted on the wall.

16
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,891
Do you

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,101
want me to believe what you just said?

18
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,020
You must not want to believe it.

19
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,731
But it is the truth.

20
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,819
I should not have listened
to you in the first place.

21
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,239
Then

22
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,242
ask Master Gyeon yourself.

23
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
That will certainly give you the truth.

24
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,802
You lost your memory.

25
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,140
Your Majesty, please punish me.

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,267
I know I will not be forgiven

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,061
for what I have done
even if I get punished.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,229
Stop!

29
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,567
-Stop.
-Your Majesty.

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,117
Leave.

31
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,080
It is hard for me

32
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,877
to even look at you right now.

33
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,390
There must be a way to find her.

34
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,436
I shall help you from now on.

35
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,441
Do not be so disappointed.

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,735
I will

37
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,738
look for another way.

38
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,743
Right.

39
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,371
He would never do such a thing.

40
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,127
Master Gyeon.

41
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,938
Master Gyeon.

42
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,942
I just heard something ridiculous.

43
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,570
What is it?

44
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
It just does not make sense,

45
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,035
so I think it is a lie.

46
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,872
I really think it is not true.

47
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,000
Your Highness.

48
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,586
I heard that...

49
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,384
you caused the dethronement of my mother.

50
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,053
It is not true, right?

51
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,855
I know it is not.

52
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,608
But

53
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,570
can you tell me that
it is not true yourself?

54
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,364
Please say

55
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,035
it is not true and it is a made-up lie.

56
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,341
Why are you silent?

57
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,554
Say it is not true.

58
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,480
Why?

59
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,150
Why are you not saying it is not true?

60
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,201
It cannot be true. It is not, is it?

61
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,869
Say it is not true!

62
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,091
I apologize,

63
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,593
Your Highness.

64
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,981
My apologies.

65
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,515
"Confucius said

66
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,269
that you must answer immediately
whenever your parents call you.

67
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,814
You must leave work if you have
been working on something.

68
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,983
You must spit out what
you have been eating.

69
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,320
You must leave everything behind
to answer your parents."

70
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,488
Prince.

71
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,199
Yes, Mother.

72
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,537
I called you to check if you understood

73
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,539
what Confucius emphasizes.

74
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,083
I shall go wherever it is to see you

75
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,460
if you wish to see me.

76
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,212
Do you mean it?

77
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,380
Mother,

78
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,257
please be healthy

79
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,092
and stay by my side for a long time.

80
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,387
That way, I can be a good son
to my mother for a long time.

81
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,474
You are the only one

82
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,477
who cares for me.

83
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,910
"Our bodies are received
by us from our parents,

84
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,413
and we must not presume
to injure or wound them.

85
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,208
This is the beginning of filial piety."

86
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,388
Gyeon U.

87
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
Is something wrong?

88
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,401
It is nothing.

89
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,570
Are you sure you are okay?

90
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,365
Yes, I am all right. Do not worry.

91
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,588
I am worried about Gyeon U's condition.

92
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,008
He says not to worry about him,

93
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,011
but he does not look fine at all.

94
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:43,976
My lady.

95
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,065
Gyeon U has found his memory back.

96
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,653
"The blind mother ruins everything."

97
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,573
Our son wrote that sentence.

98
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,163
"The blind mother ruins everything"?

99
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,334
That poster was buried

100
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,462
in his lost memory.

101
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,382
Tell me.

102
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,510
How...

103
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,014
How could our son write that?

104
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,600
He was only a child then.

105
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,397
He lost his memory because of it.

106
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,733
He suffered so much inside, did he not?

107
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,321
Then, why did you not tell me sooner?

108
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,535
I am his mother,

109
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,039
but I had no idea why my son became ill.

110
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,752
I am sorry.

111
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,519
Your Highness, it is us.

112
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,776
What is the matter?

113
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,697
Well... Something terrible happened.

114
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,664
Why is he holding a royal
interrogation all of a sudden?

115
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,876
Whom is he intending to interrogate?

116
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,963
Let me go. Let go!

117
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,883
How dare you!

118
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,886
Let go! Let go of me!

119
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,367
Your Majesty, we have brought the sinner.

120
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,914
Your Majesty, why did you...

121
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,213
Do you know what this is?

122
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,063
"Write a love letter as if the Queen
sent it to Prince Chuseong.

123
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:20,860
Write as if she is head over heels for
Prince Chuseong.

124
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,114
Refer the letter I enclosed
when copying the Queen's handwriting."

125
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,670
Shall I read the letter you attached?

126
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,964
I do not know any of this.

127
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,924
-I--
-There is clear evidence,

128
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,010
yet are you going to deny it
until the end?

129
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,595
It is all a conspiracy.

130
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,931
It must be done by someone
who wants me to be dethroned.

131
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,892
Please trust me.

132
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,730
It is all a conspiracy?

133
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,086
A prisoner was killed in a prison
of the Office of Investigation.

134
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,005
The one who killed

135
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,591
Min Yu-hwan and distributed the Jirashis.

136
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,137
A prison guard confessed that he was

137
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,723
paid to let you and the prisoner meet
in the prison that day.

138
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,933
With all this evidence,

139
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,185
are you still claiming it is a conspiracy?

140
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,274
Was it all done by you?

141
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,864
It is not true.

142
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,616
Then who?

143
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,035
All the evidence and witnesses
are pointing at you.

144
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,579
If it is not you, then who?

145
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,958
Your Majesty,
I really do not know anything about this.

146
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,293
Please trust me.

147
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,765
Tell me.

148
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,602
Did you do it by yourself?

149
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
Your Majesty.

150
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,692
Tell me right this instant!

151
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,069
Please spare me.

152
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,835
-Actually--
-Your Majesty.

153
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
Please calm down.

154
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,969
She committed high treason,

155
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,972
but she is the Queen and
the mother of the Prince.

156
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,267
Please do not lose your control.

157
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,270
Let this be dealt with
according to the law.

158
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,992
Your Majesty.

159
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,245
Please let it be dealt
with according to the law.

160
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,374
Please let it be dealt
with according to the law.

161
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,001
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

162
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,629
Please let it be dealt
with according to the law.

163
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,256
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

164
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,627
I heard Ghost Mask appeared at the
Office of Investigation recently.

165
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,421
He shot an arrow with a letter attached.

166
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,928
Is it true?

167
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,972
Why do you ask?

168
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,018
If we find him,

169
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,770
we may be able to find

170
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,980
more details
about the incident ten years ago.

171
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:31,443
We may catch the one who
is behind the Queen as well.

172
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,101
They will come to take
Wol-myeong's life tonight.

173
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
Stop.

174
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,180
Wol-myeong.

175
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,348
Is your name

176
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,185
Wol-myeong?

177
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,153
There is poison in the soup.

178
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,165
-Open the door.
-Yes, sir.

179
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,335
What are you doing? Open the door quickly.

180
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,177
-Call a physician.
-Yes, sir.

181
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,196
I hid him just in case

182
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,449
they try to hurt him again
after finding out that he is alive.

183
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,284
They always use the same method

184
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,245
like they poisoned Minister of Taxation.

185
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,749
If they are cornered, they cut
their tail and hide themselves.

186
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,473
Hurry up and bring me the Prince.

187
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,185
He is the only way I can survive.

188
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,228
Go and

189
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,982
tell him that his mother is
framed and locked in her room.

190
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,528
They say he will be with
the Queen Dowager all day long.

191
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,656
How could I dare step in her residence?

192
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,368
Bring him here by any means.

193
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,440
Have you not given up with your greed?

194
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,527
A mother wants to see her son.
How can you call that greed?

195
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,446
Give up now.

196
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,907
We have the evidence and witnesses.

197
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,993
How long will you resist?

198
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,828
I am innocent.

199
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,747
It is all a conspiracy.

200
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,000
Will Second State Councilor Jeong
let you live?

201
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,005
He has gotten rid of the people
who could drag him down.

202
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,384
You know that more than anyone else.

203
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,804
What are you talking about?

204
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,931
Confess everything honestly

205
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,017
and ask for forgiveness.

206
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,602
That is the only way

207
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,897
you can survive.

208
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,360
Think carefully.

209
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,536
What is written here?

210
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,372
This person is a wanted.

211
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,500
It says something about high treason.

212
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,462
-High treason?
-Should we not look for him?

213
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,923
They will grant 1,000 yang
to anyone who catches this man.

214
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,051
-Is it 1,000 yang?
-That is a lot.

215
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,887
-Master Gyeon?
-I am certain.

216
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,848
Master Gyeon is the only person

217
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,267
who recently asked to have
a private talk with the King.

218
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,852
How did Master Gyeon

219
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,523
have the evidence of the incident
that happened ten years ago?

220
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,534
Are you here to kill me?

221
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,624
I will never die alone.

222
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,751
I am different from those who were killed.

223
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,587
You know well.

224
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,965
Am I not the only person
whom you cannot trust

225
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,342
but have to trust?

226
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,971
So...

227
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,268
I am here to give you a chance.

228
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,778
The Prince thinks
you are his birth mother.

229
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,822
What will happen...

230
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,201
if the King passes away
earlier than expected?

231
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,208
Then you will have to rule as a regent.

232
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,004
Stay in hiding for the time being.

233
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,841
It will not take long.

234
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,428
Are you going to kill the King?

235
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,222
There is no other way.

236
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,267
You will never be able to change his mind
since there is the evidence.

237
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,730
This is the last chance I can give you.

238
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,822
Before then,

239
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,534
you need to do me a favor.

240
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,876
First,

241
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,422
we must tip the scale.

242
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,012
What do you think you are doing?

243
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,350
How dare you let this prisoner
come in here?

244
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,406
Your Majesty,

245
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,533
I...

246
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,453
came to confess my sins.

247
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,499
Ten years ago,

248
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,420
I requested to fabricate the letter

249
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,881
and poisoned the sinners imprisoned
in the Office of Investigation.

250
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,303
It was all my doing.

251
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,310
However,

252
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,605
I was threatened to do so.

253
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,983
What do you mean?

254
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,737
Who threatened you?

255
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,336
That is

256
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,757
the Chief Scholar, Gyeon Pil-hyeong.

257
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,771
I begged him

258
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,067
that I could not do it any longer,

259
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,529
but he framed me because he was
afraid I would confess everything.

260
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,697
Then...

261
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,077
why did you not confess
during the interrogation?

262
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,497
I was afraid.

263
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,500
I was afraid you might

264
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,338
abandon me if I admitted to my sins.

265
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,387
Your Majesty, do not forgive me.

266
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,515
Also, please punish
Chief Scholar Gyeon Pil-hyeong

267
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,267
who has committed high treason.

268
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,685
That is nonsense.

269
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,356
How could Chief Scholar Gyeon
commit such a thing?

270
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,858
You must not believe

271
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,319
what the sinner says without any evidence.

272
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,612
He is right.

273
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,407
It is her sly trick to deceive

274
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,742
Your Majesty and all the officials.

275
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,745
Please do not lose your insight.

276
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,580
"The blind mother ruins everything."

277
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,340
What if Master Gyeon wrote that sentence?

278
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,565
Please call them in immediately

279
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,693
and check if it is true or not.

280
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,200
Your Majesty,
please arrest them immediately.

281
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,246
Whether her confession is true
or not, I believe you need to

282
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,833
investigate this first
since it is an important matter.

283
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,796
Please give us your order, Your Majesty.

284
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,718
-Give us your order.
-Give us your order.

285
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,855
THE ADULTERY SCANDAL WHICH HAPPENED
TEN YEARS AGO IS A LIE

286
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,695
Sinners Gyeon Pil-hyeong and Gyeon U.

287
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,948
Come out and take the royal order.

288
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,748
-No, you cannot take him.
-Go.

289
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,835
You cannot take him.
Why are you doing this?

290
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,961
Gyeon U.

291
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,005
Father.

292
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,509
Arrest the traitor.

293
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,718
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,512
-Mother.
-Oh, no.

295
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,557
No, Gyeon U! Gyeon U!

296
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,726
Your Highness!

297
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,606
Your Highness, they are...

298
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,735
-They are in huge trouble.
-Who are?

299
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,738
The Queen confessed who was behind her.

300
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,741
She did not confess
Councilor Jeong's name.

301
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,078
She pointed out
Chief Scholar Gyeon and his son.

302
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,833
Master Gyeon.

303
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,300
It has been confirmed

304
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,844
that Master Gyeon wrote the sentence

305
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,013
ten years ago.

306
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,517
Both his father and
himself admitted to it.

307
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,145
But it cannot be the evidence

308
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,938
that they were behind the Queen.

309
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,984
We are investigating it.

310
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,945
The Queen claims that the evidence

311
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,823
which Master Gyeon handed in
was fabricated.

312
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,622
The one who handed in
the evidence to my father is...

313
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,832
Yes,

314
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,919
it is Master Gyeon.

315
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,973
Did you also fabricate

316
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,894
the evidence related to
the Queen's treason?

317
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,063
I said I did not.

318
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,901
How brazen.

319
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,491
Both the father and son are

320
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,785
so stubborn that they aren't giving in.

321
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,788
Then

322
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,041
we can use a sharper knife
to cut them down.

323
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,131
Search everywhere.

324
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,053
Search here.

325
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,849
Find every single thing

326
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,143
that is related to the jirashis.

327
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,728
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

328
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,067
What is going on?

329
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,819
-Not this.
-Gosh, look.

330
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,822
-These are just books.
-Go away.

331
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,908
Why are you doing this?

332
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,118
You!

333
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,162
What are you doing?

334
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,668
There has been a report that
the jirashis were made in here.

335
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,879
Why would we make jirashis here?

336
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,592
You must know since
you made them yourselves.

337
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,555
We are writers who write novels

338
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,806
-in here--
-I found something.

339
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,856
This. Is this not for making jirashis?

340
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,233
What are you talking about?
That is not ours.

341
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:51,029
Do not deny. You hid it in the inner room.

342
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,072
We know

343
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,034
that you made the jirashis here
and spread fake rumors.

344
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,244
What are you talking about?

345
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,164
Admit to it when you are taken
to the Office of Investigation.

346
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,171
Confess that Master Gyeon
was behind all this.

347
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,131
That is

348
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,967
the only way you can be saved.

349
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,184
-Arrest them.
-Yes, sir.

350
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,733
I am sorry, Father.

351
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,736
It is

352
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,238
all my fault.

353
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,371
You were only ten years old then.

354
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,542
It cannot be only your fault.

355
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,923
I am more at fault

356
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,092
for turning a blind eye

357
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,011
when I knew everything.

358
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,847
Father.

359
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,308
So do not blame yourself.

360
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,192
-Let go.
-We did not do anything wrong.

361
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,902
Let go of me.

362
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,154
-We are innocent.
-Do not do this.

363
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,532
-We did nothing wrong.
-Why are you...

364
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,158
Master Gyeon!

365
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,119
-Gyeon U.
-Gyeon U.

366
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,122
What happened?

367
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,922
I did just as you ordered.

368
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,800
Well done.

369
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,177
Visit my place sometime.

370
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,096
Let us have a drink together.

371
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,517
It is my honor, my lord.

372
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,077
Master Gyeon's friends have been
arrested for spreading the jirashis.

373
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,914
Things are going to
Master Gyeon's disadvantage.

374
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,048
Father, you know that

375
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,217
they aren't responsible for this.

376
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,386
They found evidence,

377
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,930
so an investigation must follow.

378
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,725
Father.

379
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,942
I hope someone innocent does not

380
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,445
get falsely charged anymore.

381
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,763
Da-yeon.

382
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,642
What brings you here?

383
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,060
I am too ashamed to say this,

384
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,562
but I came here to ask for a favor.

385
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,147
A favor?

386
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,398
Da-yeon.

387
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,735
My brother and father were taken
to the Office of Investigation.

388
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,114
Please talk to your father and help them

389
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,658
-get released--
-Why should I do that?

390
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,786
It is not like I am his fiancee.

391
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,374
I hope you do not come to see me
for things like this again.

392
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,669
Wait.

393
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,379
-Da-yeon!
-Lady Da-yeon!

394
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,217
Goodness.

395
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,304
Goodness, what should I do? Gyeon U...

396
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,147
Throw it away.

397
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,108
-What?
-No.

398
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,735
Burn it.

399
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,072
I need to destroy it
so that no one else can have it.

400
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,430
You look terrible.

401
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,477
I heard you wrote that sentence.

402
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,357
Why did you make the
jirashis and distribute them?

403
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,776
I did not do such a thing.

404
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,904
Wrong. You shouldn't give such an answer.

405
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,823
Let me ask you again.

406
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,329
-Why did you kill Min Yu-hwan?
-I did not.

407
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,581
Why did you fabricate the incident
that happened 10 years ago?

408
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,583
I did not.

409
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,501
I think the one behind all this

410
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,004
is someone else.

411
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,465
You are wrong again.

412
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,176
I said you shouldn't give such an answer.

413
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,762
The truth will be revealed no matter what.

414
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,351
Who will be next?

415
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,820
I heard your close friends were arrested.

416
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,406
Guess who will be next.

417
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,950
Your mother?

418
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,078
Your sister?

419
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,790
Or...

420
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,460
the Princess

421
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,670
that you care greatly for?

422
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,550
Who will it be?

423
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,141
Do you feel like confessing now?

424
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,652
There must be a sacrifice...

425
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,614
to protect something precious.

426
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,969
Princess.

427
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,110
Living my life,

428
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,404
I learned that

429
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,240
that not everything goes my way.

430
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,368
Sometimes, a truth turns into a lie

431
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,038
and a lie turns into a truth.

432
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,332
Also, there are times

433
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,210
when they do not get revealed.

434
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,424
But even if it is not revealed right now,

435
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,053
even if it remains hidden for a long time,

436
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,222
those lies and misunderstandings

437
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,017
will eventually be revealed some day.

438
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,228
That letter...

439
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,191
Why do you think Master Gyeon
handed it in just now?

440
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,156
Ten years ago...

441
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,700
or

442
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,745
It would have changed if he had

443
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,998
brought the letter a little earlier.

444
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,086
He lost his memory.

445
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,633
He wrote the poster based
on a misunderstanding.

446
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,802
He followed your mother to undo
what he did,

447
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,139
but he lost his memory in the woods.

448
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,608
Are you okay?

449
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,694
Still, I hate him.

450
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,781
Even though it was
based on a misunderstanding,

451
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,408
and even though there was a good reason,

452
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,245
I still hate him.

453
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,081
I resent him.

454
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,417
Why must it be him...

455
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,671
of all people?

456
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,049
Why did he--

457
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,759
I know how unbearably difficult

458
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,554
and resentful it is,

459
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,098
but let us endure a little longer.

460
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,851
The truth will be revealed at the end.

461
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,441
Yes, Grandmother.

462
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,277
I am sorry.

463
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,738
I am sorry for making you
suffer like this.

464
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,507
Your Highness.

465
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,558
Lieutenant Gang.

466
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,062
What brings you here this late at night?

467
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,027
Are you here

468
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,363
to see Master Gyeon?

469
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,608
Why did you come to a place like this?

470
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,571
I heard about it.

471
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,035
You were mistaken
and you lost your memory.

472
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,370
And

473
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,375
I heard that you handed
the evidence to Father.

474
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,753
I am not here to forgive you.

475
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,506
Even though it is true,

476
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,551
and even though you had no choice,

477
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,387
I cannot forgive you.

478
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,599
I came to tell you that I cannot.

479
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,644
Your Highness.

480
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,647
I know that you were not behind the Queen.

481
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,318
This time as well, it must be
Councilor Jeong's scheme.

482
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,780
Still, it does not change...

483
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,708
It does not change the fact
that you caused the incident.

484
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,212
By all means, I will try

485
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,382
not to make things go
Councilor Jeong's way.

486
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,431
But I'm not doing this for you.

487
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,728
I wanted to tell you this

488
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,439
in person so that

489
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,525
you wouldn't misinterpret

490
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,445
my intentions or have false hope.

491
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,619
That is why I am here.

492
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,790
I am done talking, so I will leave now.

493
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,948
Can I talk to Lieutenant Gang?

494
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,161
He has

495
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,164
finished the preparation.

496
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,879
I am not sure

497
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,424
if we can trust Councilor Jeong's promise.

498
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,137
Look at the situation I am in.

499
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,309
I must hold onto it
whether he will keep it or not.

500
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,794
Your Highness, did Councilor Jeong...

501
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,798
Did Councilor Jeong not promise you that
he would prepare a boat for you?

502
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,012
Let us hurry back.

503
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,898
How dare you block my way?
Get lost right this instant!

504
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,065
Your Highness.

505
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,493
No!

506
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,094
How dare you!

507
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,138
I am the Queen of this country!

508
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,973
If you kill me,

509
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:45,185
you will never be able to save your lives!

510
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,079
Do not come any closer.

511
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,125
Send this message to Councilor Jeong.

512
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,753
I will never die alone.

513
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,755
I will become a ghost

514
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:41,217
and drag him down with me if I must!

515
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:32,143
It's an end of an era,
and yours is about to begin.

516
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:36,398
All we need is to justify your emergence.

517
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,530
BOOK OF PROGNOSTICATIONS

518
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,407
"After the Lee family's destruction,

519
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,159
a king from the Jeong family appears

520
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,453
and a new world lies ahead."

521
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,873
Let's make this prophecy come true.

522
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,466
We are distributing

523
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,053
copies of this book in secret.

524
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,933
Soon, the rumor will spread out.

525
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,394
Subjects always

526
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:18,273
dream of a new hero and a new hope.

527
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,651
Be their hero, Councilor Jeong.

528
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,492
All right, let us enjoy
this drink for today.

529
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,537
-Let me pour you a drink.
-All right.

530
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,668
For a new world!

531
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,545
-For a new world.
-For a new world.

532
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,140
BOOK OF PROGNOSTICATIONS

533
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,100
Who is there?

534
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,037
How dare you try to confront me?

535
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,957
It is over, Jeong Gi-jun.

536
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,470
You...

537
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,181
Do you recognize me?

538
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,933
Prince Eunseong.

539
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:17,243
Ghost Mask is the younger
brother of Prince Chuseong.

540
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,039
I thought you died ten years ago.

541
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,124
You survived like a rat.

542
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,793
You are the rat, not me.

543
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,546
That was quite a scene

544
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,674
when you ran away,
framing an innocent person.

545
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,853
It was nice meeting you in a while.

546
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,107
Goodbye.
