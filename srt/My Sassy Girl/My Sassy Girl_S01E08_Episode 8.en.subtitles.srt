1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,661
What are you trying to do?

2
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,288
We have no evidence or witnesses.

3
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,874
You cannot do anything
only with that letter.

4
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,001
Then what do you suggest me to do?

5
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,212
Just stay quiet pretending not to know?

6
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,008
You must if necessary.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,218
You can win every battle

8
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,138
if you know yourself and the enemy.

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,474
It would not be too late

10
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,225
to take action

11
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,062
after finding out what exactly
happened to your mother

12
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,064
ten years ago.

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,486
Your Majesty.

14
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,615
Dethrone the Princess.

15
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,785
-Dethrone the Princess.
-Dethrone the Princess.

16
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,829
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,166
sneaking out of the palace
without permission was not enough,

18
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,795
but she went outside again
and cannot be found now.

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,339
You cannot be silent about this anymore.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,177
Please dethrone her.

21
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,930
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,935
Your Majesty, please dethrone her.

23
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,813
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

24
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:50,193
Please dethrone the Princess.

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,364
Your Majesty, Second State
Councilor Jeong is here to see you.

26
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,118
Let him in.

27
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,145
Please dethrone the Princess.

28
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,273
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,779
Punish Master Gyeon for
not serving her properly.

30
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,823
And accept the royal marriage
with the Qing.

31
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,199
That is

32
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,118
the only way to calm the officials down

33
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,413
and stop her dethronement.

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,044
Your Majesty,

35
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,755
please understand

36
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,175
this loyal servant who
is very much concerned...

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,805
about this country
and the Royal Family's welfare.

38
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,315
Your Majesty, please dethrone her.

39
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,942
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

40
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,736
-Do not be shaken.
-Your Majesty,

41
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,405
please dethrone her.

42
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:18,948
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,284
-please dethrone her.
-That is

44
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,077
exactly what they want.

45
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,205
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

46
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,834
We shall protest here

47
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,378
until Your Majesty approves
her dethronement.

48
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,007
Your Majesty, please dethrone...

49
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,973
Your Majesty,

50
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:48,228
please dethrone her.

51
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,231
-Please dethrone her.
-Please dethrone her.

52
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,081
You did well.

53
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,045
Your Highness.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,304
Jeong Gi-jun.

55
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,765
Be careful of that man.

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,851
Your mother's disappearance

57
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,312
may be because of him.

58
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,023
Are you all right?

59
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,109
You look pale.

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,820
Do not worry.

61
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,280
I just advised,

62
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,324
His Majesty a way to help you.

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,420
Thank you for your help.

64
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,340
He is waiting.

65
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,345
Tell him I am here.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,890
Your Majesty, the Princess
is here to see you.

67
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,444
Where have you been all night?

68
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,325
I asked you where you have been.

69
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,243
My apologies, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,538
You will stay quiet, is that it?

71
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,041
It is all my fault,

72
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,001
so punish me.

73
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,879
It happened because
I did not serve Her Highness properly.

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,339
No, Master Gyeon had no choice--

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,842
Return to your residence.

76
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,306
-Father.
-I told you to go.

77
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,465
I will ask you one last time.

78
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,468
Not as the King,

79
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,596
but as her father.

80
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,391
Where did you go with her?

81
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,193
Tell him nothing?

82
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,153
-Why...
-It was him at the end

83
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,948
who approved Mother's dethronement

84
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,408
and covered up the incident.

85
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,744
I can't

86
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,496
tell him anything

87
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,206
about Mother or Master Min.

88
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,626
Not until I come to know
what happened ten years ago.

89
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,055
I am sorry,

90
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,934
but it is not something
I can tell so easily.

91
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,278
You...

92
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,323
connived the Princess' misdeed

93
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,617
and betrayed my trust.

94
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,288
You

95
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,124
do not deserve

96
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,376
to be the Prince's teacher.

97
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,588
I shall dismiss you from your position.

98
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,025
Master Gyeon.

99
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,423
The Princess has returned to the palace.

100
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,688
What did you say?

101
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,567
He ordered me not to hang out with you

102
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,612
but read and self-reflect at home.

103
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,740
-Are you sure?
-Why would I lie?

104
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,247
You can go ask yourself then.

105
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,291
I was so worried.

106
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,339
Were you worried I might get punished?

107
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,633
Yes.

108
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,426
Excuse me?

109
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,011
Hyemyeong!

110
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,306
Hyemyeong!

111
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,560
Prince.

112
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,063
Is that true that you will be
sent out of the palace?

113
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,607
Is that true, master?

114
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,529
That is just a lie.

115
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,533
I heard the officials are
protesting for your dethronement.

116
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,744
Let them protest all they want.

117
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,205
Do not worry.

118
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,416
I will not leave you behind.

119
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,377
Stop.

120
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,427
Hyemyeong!

121
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,642
If you cry, my heart will break.

122
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,603
Do not cry.

123
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,689
If you do, my heart will break again.

124
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,695
Hyemyeong...

125
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,673
Your Majesty,

126
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,344
please dethrone the Princess.

127
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,680
-Dethrone the Princess.
-Dethrone the Princess.

128
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,807
Your Majesty,

129
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,394
please dethrone the Princess.

130
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,773
-Dethrone the Princess.
-Dethrone the Princess.

131
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,400
Your Majesty,

132
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,737
please dethrone the Princess.

133
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,157
-Dethrone the Princess.
-Dethrone the Princess.

134
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,872
What if he doesn't give in?

135
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,709
Should I tell you every detail?

136
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,379
I am telling you I will help out.

137
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,922
Just keep an eye on the Princess.

138
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,759
I will take care of the rest.

139
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,642
Now,

140
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,522
I know who chased me and framed me.

141
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,191
Jeong Gi-jun.

142
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,818
Your Highness.

143
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,827
Where have you been?

144
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,246
You should have told us so.

145
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,705
Are you okay?

146
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,583
Why? Were you worried
something happened to me?

147
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:54,505
Master Gyeon's family was in chaos too.

148
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,006
What do you mean?

149
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,430
How...

150
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:07,309
How could you betray your mother?

151
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,894
I did not betray you.

152
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,439
You ran away and slept over.

153
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,774
You stay quiet.

154
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,945
Gyeon U, you did not want to go, right?

155
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,199
That sassy Princess forced you,

156
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,534
right?

157
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,288
I followed her
because I wanted to help her.

158
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,544
Are you siding her now?

159
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,839
You totally fell in love.

160
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,842
-Shut it!
-Why are you taking it out on me?

161
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,638
Never hang out with the Princess, okay?

162
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,601
If you do this again,
you will see me dead.

163
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,856
Mother.

164
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,903
Goodness.

165
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,341
Father.

166
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,843
You crossed the line.

167
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,013
Do not get close to the Princess anymore.

168
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,787
You do not deserve to be
the Prince's teacher.

169
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,040
I shall dismiss you from your position.

170
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,670
I can't

171
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,090
tell him anything about
Mother or Master Min.

172
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,009
Not until I know exactly
what happened ten years ago.

173
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,794
OFFICE OF STATE RECORDS

174
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,205
-What are you doing?
-I thought you went home.

175
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,832
I asked you first.

176
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,043
I just...

177
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,128
Are you here for the state records?

178
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,963
No.

179
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,382
Go back to your residence.

180
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,093
Then why are you here?

181
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,765
Because I was worried
that you would be here.

182
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,611
Even a king is forbidden to
look into the state records.

183
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,738
If you get caught...

184
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,032
I might

185
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,576
be dethroned

186
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,745
or even be killed.

187
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,622
You know well.

188
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,624
Because I have no way

189
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,918
to find out the truth otherwise.

190
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,088
No one tells me

191
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,923
and no one

192
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,009
can tell me.

193
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,099
Turn a blind eye for me.

194
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,185
I cannot do that.

195
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,568
The Princess is wandering around
the Office of State Records?

196
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,779
Yes, Your Highness.

197
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,823
Office of State Records...

198
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,539
We are missing last year's records.

199
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,920
This way, Your Highness.

200
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,261
These are the records
written around that time.

201
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,874
Put this where it belongs.

202
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,376
Over there.

203
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,763
It is so dusty.

204
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,239
Are you done?

205
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,824
-Yes, master.
-Let us go then.

206
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,195
Queen.

207
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,825
Where are you going in such a hurry?

208
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,457
Well...

209
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,045
I was going to the Prince.

210
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,132
I see. Then let us go together.

211
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,300
Actually...

212
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,555
What is it?

213
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,893
I was going to look for the Princess.

214
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
The Princess?

215
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,346
Do not be so disappointed.

216
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,349
I do not understand,

217
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,810
why there is no record only
about that year.

218
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,064
It was ordered to put
in silence for 100 years.

219
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,151
The records may be kept in somewhere else.

220
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,077
Princess Hyemyeong.

221
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,222
Follow me.

222
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,506
They hid a lot.

223
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,924
Did we find them all?

224
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,343
Let us burn them all.

225
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,316
What brings you here?

226
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,152
Where is the Princess?

227
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:34,181
Why do you think she went to
the Office of State Records?

228
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,307
It is terrible

229
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,602
if she went there to read
the state records.

230
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,145
We must hurry.

231
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,771
I think

232
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,441
you are mistaken.

233
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,279
I met her in her residence.

234
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,678
Did you read the state records?

235
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,398
What is the reason you
risked your life to read them?

236
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,660
Do you not realize
what you just committed?

237
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,038
My apologies.

238
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,792
How could you be on this with her?

239
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,462
Was being dismissed not enough?

240
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,510
My apologies.

241
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,433
I do not know what you
are looking for, but stop here.

242
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,435
Do not attempt to know more.

243
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,729
Forget everything you have found out.

244
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,981
Grandmother.

245
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,565
Master Gyeon too.

246
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,070
You will have to expect worse
if you disobey my order.

247
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,430
Why do you not tell
the King about your mother?

248
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,309
I think it would be better...

249
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,603
Master Gyeon.

250
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,191
Do not mind my business from now on.

251
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,695
That is not what I meant.

252
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,865
You're not helping and
you're getting in my way.

253
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,785
Forget about it all.

254
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,622
About my mother and Councilor Jeong.

255
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,625
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

256
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,378
It is just that I am worried about you...

257
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,672
Is it not that you are
worried about yourself?

258
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,300
-Your Highness.
-Do not worry

259
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,135
if it is because of your dismissal.

260
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,472
I will do whatever it takes
to reinstate you.

261
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,766
Why would you distort my words?

262
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,768
Do not act like you care about me.

263
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,603
You're out of line.

264
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,215
I sent the invitation to
the Prince of the Qing.

265
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,467
Thankfully, he was glad.

266
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,470
He wants to leave for Joseon soon.

267
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,182
We have finished preparing
for the stuff here.

268
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:08,395
As soon as he is ready, we will set off.

269
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,483
I hope you prepare well
according to the plan.

270
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,738
Good work.

271
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,909
This is a token of my gratitude.

272
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,205
He is looking forward to this visit.

273
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,456
Do not worry.

274
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,419
I will pay more
if everything goes as planned.

275
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,755
My lord.

276
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,133
You have a guest.

277
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,938
He told me to send the Princess
to the Qing

278
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,940
if I want to stop the dethronement.

279
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,945
I do not know.

280
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,449
What should I do to protect her?

281
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,701
What should I do for her?

282
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,163
You should not send her off like this.

283
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,629
Are you out of your mind?

284
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,174
The Princess seems to have
tried to read the state records.

285
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,510
-The state records?
-Perhaps,

286
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,347
she heard something from Master Min.

287
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,292
You know the Queen is
behind the King's decisions.

288
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,545
Rumors say that she and Prince Chuseong

289
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,672
are scheming to attack you.

290
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,969
You must attack them first before they do.

291
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,266
I have a nice plan.

292
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,395
Before I tell you,

293
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,899
you need to make me a promise.

294
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,903
I want you to make me the next queen

295
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,782
once the Queen is gone.

296
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,663
The Queen has been in league with

297
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,332
Prince Chuseong for a long time.

298
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,501
Shut your mouth.

299
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,044
I have evidence.

300
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,589
I have seen you just now,

301
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,010
but I miss you already
and write you a letter.

302
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,556
When will my longing end?

303
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,642
I know I must not do this,

304
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,769
but my heart to you...

305
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,187
I cannot believe,

306
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,107
she actually wrote this letter,

307
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,984
but it is her writing for certain.

308
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,571
This court lady

309
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,282
has delivered the letters for them.

310
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,789
Was this really

311
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,625
written by the Queen?

312
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,673
I will punish you immediately if you lie.

313
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,341
Please.

314
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,218
I had no idea

315
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,095
that they were...

316
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,973
exchanging this kind of letters.

317
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,984
This...

318
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,113
will be more than enough to
pay for your mother's medicine.

319
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,823
Thank you.

320
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,128
Search the whereabouts of
the Jeongungjeon servants

321
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,214
who worked ten years ago.

322
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,840
Why...

323
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,801
I need to know now.

324
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,223
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,457
What? Was your dream about the Princess?

326
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,798
Have this.

327
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,968
Mother has made this herbal tonic

328
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,722
despite all the fuss she made yesterday.

329
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,476
Take this.

330
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,776
The sun is up high.

331
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,236
Are you not going to work?

332
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,060
You gave him the herbal tonic

333
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,978
and saw him off.

334
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,523
Are you really mad at him?

335
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,192
Even so, I need to see my son off.

336
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,152
Then why did you hide?

337
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,738
Because I am angry now.

338
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,825
Stop shaking your legs.

339
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,828
Okay, so write on.

340
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,207
My lips and her lips meet.

341
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,625
That is right.

342
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,628
Do not act like you care about me.

343
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,921
You're out of line.

344
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:37,760
Then my hand starts to undress her top.

345
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,721
After then, my...

346
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,933
Her...

347
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,364
What are you looking at?

348
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,158
It must be hard for you.

349
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,287
Of course, it is hard for him.
He is jobless.

350
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,041
This is really hard.

351
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,961
Every time I read your books,

352
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,212
I cannot help but sigh.

353
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,131
-It is hard to turn a single page.
-Why that...

354
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,675
Our stories are so popular.

355
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,677
Let us just stop.

356
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,054
His standards are too low for us.

357
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:26,017
Even the Princess talked highly

358
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,768
of that book.

359
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,812
Do you have any idea?

360
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,857
Master, you have a visitor.

361
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,233
Who is it?

362
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,194
Not you.

363
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,863
Master Gyeon, you have a visitor.

364
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,867
Here.

365
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,420
Hi, Lady Da-yeon.

366
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,799
It has been a long time.

367
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,355
I heard you went through a lot

368
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,565
because of the Princess.

369
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,859
That is not true.

370
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:17,860
But

371
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,112
you were dismissed.

372
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,284
My family do not know about it yet.

373
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,702
Please do not tell Gyeon Hui.

374
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,038
Of course, I will not.

375
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,123
Thank you.

376
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,502
I will ask for help

377
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,295
to my father.

378
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,924
If I tell him how unfair
the situation was for you,

379
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,093
-he will--
-You do not need to.

380
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,933
I will take care of my own business.

381
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,811
It is not something you should step in.

382
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,275
I feel a distance

383
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,361
between me and you.

384
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,282
I do not see a reason

385
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,034
why we should get closer.

386
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,972
Like always, you are handsome.

387
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,390
-Is that so?
-Sure.

388
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,810
Lady Da-yeon.

389
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,897
I cannot live

390
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,025
without you.

391
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,234
What do you think?

392
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,447
That was such a sweet comment.

393
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,908
Hey, you should call it a proposal,

394
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,327
not a comment.

395
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,203
Whatever.

396
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,915
I just like how it is said. Sweet comment!

397
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,251
Whatever.

398
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,171
-Hold it higher.
-Sorry.

399
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,256
Goodness.

400
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,345
Lady Da-yeon.

401
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,473
What do you want?

402
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,854
I heard Gyeon U got

403
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,523
-dismissed at--
-I know.

404
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,233
Well, then.

405
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,236
Well...

406
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,197
Lady Da-yeon.

407
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,293
-It is all right.
-Do not be upset.

408
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,129
Is it funny to you?

409
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,423
You punks!

410
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,841
You little...

411
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,802
I will get going first.

412
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,437
Your Majesty, a messenger
came from the Qing.

413
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,232
THE PRINCE OF QING IS COMING.

414
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,165
The Prince of Qing is coming.

415
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:25,005
He plans to propose to you
and go back to Qing with you.

416
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,511
I am not going.

417
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,598
Are you going to cause
your father another trouble?

418
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,935
That will

419
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,439
work as a huge disadvantage for
the Prince in the future.

420
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,545
I wish to go to my mother.

421
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,298
Eat this and regain your health.

422
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,134
Everyone is worried about you.

423
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:15,222
Let me go to my mother.

424
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,016
You are facing your mother now.

425
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,477
Why would you say so?

426
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:24,273
Stop whining and eat this.

427
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,242
If you keep behaving like this,
your brother will suffer more.

428
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,995
Your dead mother is a sinner.

429
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,246
Are you going to...

430
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,042
make the Prince be the son of the sinner?

431
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,527
You always hide

432
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,695
behind the Prince.

433
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,324
But...

434
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,203
your threat will not work anymore.

435
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,791
I am no longer a child
who was so scared of you.

436
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,293
That was me ten years ago. Not anymore.

437
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,656
I am not sure what I should do.

438
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,246
Approve the royal marriage.

439
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,749
Mother.

440
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,376
If the Prince comes,

441
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,504
it will be harder to refuse.

442
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,508
But...

443
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,179
The Princess is already their target.

444
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,098
At least for her sake,

445
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,518
it would be better that way.

446
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,497
Gosh, it stinks.

447
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,292
-What a savage.
-Seriously.

448
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,169
Goodness.

449
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,303
I had no idea you
enjoy eating fermented skate.

450
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:03,307
How do you manage to eat that stinky fish?

451
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,351
Taste some first.

452
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,187
First time is always the hardest,
but you'll get addicted right away.

453
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,480
I guarantee...

454
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,068
I guarantee

455
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,155
that you will start to crave this
even in your sleep.

456
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,454
You guarantee what?

457
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,838
There he goes again.
He might have bipolar disorder.

458
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,485
My apologies.

459
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,280
How could you be on this with her?

460
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,700
Was being dismissed not enough?

461
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,916
The King is entering inside.

462
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,647
You lost weight.

463
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,275
It is not true.

464
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,278
Hyemyeong.

465
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,700
Do you still have nothing to say to me?

466
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,042
The Prince of Qing is

467
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,795
coming to see you.

468
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,551
Prepare to greet him.

469
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,511
Father.

470
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,641
Are you accepting the royal marriage?

471
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,268
It is time

472
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,937
you get married now.

473
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,234
I cannot go.

474
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,989
I need to find

475
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,533
Mother.

476
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,537
What did you

477
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,456
just say?

478
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,383
Do you remember this?

479
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,902
I heard you gave this ring to her.

480
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,947
Even on the day she was dethroned,

481
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,741
she had this on her finger.

482
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,915
Master Min brought this to me

483
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,042
after meeting with my mother
three years ago.

484
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,259
Is she

485
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,594
alive?

486
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,639
I

487
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,975
believe so.

488
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,778
You asked me why I did not say anything.

489
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,406
I could not.

490
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,827
Because you

491
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,204
ordered to put Mother's incident
in silence for 100 years.

492
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,331
You did not permit me

493
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,334
to even say I missed her.

494
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,841
I am not going anywhere.

495
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,052
I cannot.

496
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,526
Good work, everyone.

497
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,404
He was going to approve anyway,
so why did he resist?

498
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,531
Everything will be over

499
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,742
once things work out well with the Qing.

500
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,785
There must not be any mistakes.

501
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,870
We have prepared

502
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,414
everything thoroughly.

503
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,625
This is like killing two birds
with one stone.

504
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,711
Sending the annoying Princess off
and making a profit out of it.

505
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,047
It is going as we planned.

506
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,965
Let us cheer

507
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,509
to celebrate it!

508
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,721
Good. I will pour you a drink too.

509
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,686
-My lord.
-Goodness!

510
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,064
Why have you not visited us recently?

511
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,857
I missed you.

512
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,026
Hello, Hyang-dan.

513
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,779
-Good.
-Let us go in.

514
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,822
-I am going in.
-Let him in.

515
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,116
Goodness.

516
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,078
I had no idea a dead body
was under the floor.

517
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,626
This way.

518
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,519
Your Highness, this is...

519
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,479
Do you like it?

520
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,691
It is so pretty.

521
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,069
They say mandarin ducks

522
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,656
love and care for each other eternally,
once they find each other.

523
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,991
I wish to live

524
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,953
a happy life with you
like those mandarin ducks.

525
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,622
Your Highness.

526
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,183
The Prince of Qing?

527
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,853
He is on his way to propose
to the Princess.

528
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,313
It has been several days

529
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,023
since he crossed the border.

530
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,155
Master Gyeon will greet him?

531
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,992
He is the perfect person to be in charge.

532
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,621
He studied abroad,
so he knows well about the Qing.

533
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,247
We do not need translators.

534
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,624
Also,

535
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,585
he is close to the Princess.

536
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,839
That seems to be a great idea.
Your Majesty.

537
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,965
I do not see

538
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,468
any better person than him.

539
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,058
Master Gyeon was dismissed.

540
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,729
This is very important for the
diplomacy between the two countries.

541
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,231
He's the perfect man for the job.

542
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,984
There's no reason to find someone else.

543
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,742
I cannot.

544
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,036
How could I greet him?

545
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,746
-It is the King's orders.
-Father.

546
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,040
Will you disobey him?

547
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:13,922
Just do it.

548
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,056
Now that Master Gyeon is in charge,

549
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,350
even if things go out of our plan,

550
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,394
Master Gyeon and the Princess

551
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,688
will take full responsibility.

552
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,356
That is right.

553
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,484
Of course,

554
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,820
it must go according to our plan.

555
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,238
Sure.

556
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:45,787
Your Highness, what brings you here?

557
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,997
Second State Councilor Jeong,

558
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,708
I have something to tell you alone.

559
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,808
What is it that you want to say?

560
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,393
Not long ago,

561
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,688
Master Min was found dead.

562
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,816
-Was he?
-I have

563
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,944
his letter that he left behind.

564
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,701
Do you not want to know
what is written inside?

565
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,078
A traitor's letter.

566
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,289
Should I be curious?

567
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,334
He mentioned

568
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,128
my mother in the letter.

569
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,798
Now,

570
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,967
are you curious?

571
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,933
I

572
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,353
cannot leave this country

573
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,105
before I find the truth about all this.

574
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,485
Your Highness,

575
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,738
why are you telling me this by the way?

576
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,200
Do you really not know?

577
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,954
I am not sure what is written,
but why do you not have

578
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,413
Office of Investigation

579
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,290
take care of the dethroned queen's matter?

580
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,334
It was ordered to put in silence.

581
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,420
You could be placed in danger.

582
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,840
I am thinking as well.

583
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,759
Do not think too hard.

584
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,220
You are busy as is,
preparing to greet your fiance.

585
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,931
I clearly told you I will not

586
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,975
go to Qing.

587
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,727
The country's welfare is on the line.

588
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,939
It is not something you can choose.

589
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,278
Do you really want to stop

590
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,364
your brother from
becoming the crown prince?

591
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,826
What do you mean?

592
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,412
We are discussing

593
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,831
his becoming crown prince
with the Qing at the moment.

594
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,876
Things are on edge now.

595
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,546
What would happen
if the Prince of Qing's proposal

596
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,381
is rejected?

597
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,272
They are waiting at the Envoy Residence.

598
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,027
Your Highness,

599
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,362
what should we do?

600
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,553
The Prince and the envoys
arrived in the capital.

601
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,139
They will be here soon. What should we do?

602
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,184
Why is the Princess not here yet?

603
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,229
She is coming, is she?

604
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,966
This way.

605
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:33,074
The Princess is here!

606
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:24,542
You look more beautiful than ever,
Your Highness.

607
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,046
Thank you.

608
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,550
This is the Prince of Qing.

609
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,267
Hello, I am Darhan.

610
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,064
Hello, I am Princess Hyemyeong.

611
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,885
The Prince of Qing seems
to be very fond of her.

612
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,429
Must I make her go to Qing?

613
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,724
Think only about protecting
the Princess and the Prince.

614
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,560
Do not go.

615
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,229
The installation of
the Crown Prince is on the line.

616
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,274
She has no choice but to go to the Qing.

617
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,525
She is dead.

618
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,610
I thought something incredible
was hidden in the letter.

619
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,362
...and no witnesses.

620
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,030
The Princess is being suspicious.

621
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,490
Watch what she does outside the palace.

622
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,076
Find out anything that could be
Second State Councilor Jeong's weakness.

623
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,786
My lady.

624
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,746
What is your wish?

625
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,707
I can make it happen.

626
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,879
