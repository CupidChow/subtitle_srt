No.

39
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,710
Because she knows that you're driving your truck all year.

40

She was afraid to put you in danger.

That's also a no. Because I'm an outstanding teacher.

You can let it go and not care about it.

You had a chance to save her.

You previously worked at Jiaodao City Government with a transportation company?

You-you are already at this age,

103
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,360
what made you think of coming to our Jialin city for work.

104
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,510
It's because my wife had to relocate for her job.

105
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,900
I understand it now.

106
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,690
But, Mr. Wang, the employee benefit at Jialin

107
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,260
is not as good as your previous company. You really need to think this through.

108
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,240
Then let's do this. Jialin just opened a new special tourist travel route.

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,290

Indeed.

That route is indeed hard to drive.

We usually look for more experienced drivers who are familiar with the route to drive that bus.

117

The route is pretty long and there are many hassles.

Why?

119

Do you really want to drive Bus 45?

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,970
We pulled out the receipt and will confirm with the Forensic team.

172
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,420
They hid for four years and a made bomb

173
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,330
just for today.

174
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,790
Chief Du.

175
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,400
We also checked with Jiaodao.

176
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,730
They found out Wang Xingde and his wife have no connections with the two youngsters on board.

177
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,540
Do you think we still have another loop?

178
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,590
I don't know.

179
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,600
I always feel like it's unfinished.

180
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,800
This shouldn't be the ending.

181
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,870
Now, the only thing we can do,

182
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,090
is to think of a way to investigate the truth.

183
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,690
This way, no matter what happens,

184
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,690
at least if we know the truth,

185
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,060
we'll be able to know the key to solving the problem and have the upper hand.

186
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,630
But now we can't even get out. How do we investigate?

187
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,270
I'm thinking whether I should ask my advisor.

188
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,870
Actually, prior to this, I found out that Wang Mengmeng was an alum of my college, I wanted to ask her.

189
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,760
But I never got the chance.

190
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,740
Since Mengmeng's situation became this big,

191
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,660
the professors and teachers should know some things, right?

192
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,490
Ask her.

193
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,040
Li Shiqing?

194
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,130
Adivsor Wu.

195
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,720
This girl here, why did you just call me now after this whole ordeal?

196
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,740
- Did you get hurt?
- I'm fine.

197
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,660
Have you called home yet?

198
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,520
I haven't got a chance yet, but I'm really fine.

199
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
You were just riding the bus,

200
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,840
how did you just coincide with such chaos?

201
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,650
It's just...

202
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,710
Hello.

203
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,790
H-he is my boyfriend.

204
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,790
We were together when everything happened.

205
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,200
Hurry and take a seat. Don't stand.

206
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,020
You're really okay?

207
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,320
Have you confirmed with the doctor?

208
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,450
I'm fine. Look at me, I'm all good.

209
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,490
Why don't we still do a full body checkup?

210
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,740
I'm really okay. Don't worry.

211
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,490
Seeing that you are all right makes me feel at ease.

212
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,140
I was scared to death.

213
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,700
When I answered the phone, I almost fainted.

214
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,230
How come it's this Bus 45 again?

215
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,660
You said "again". Did something happen to Bus 45 before?

216
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,150
Five years ago, when I had just become an advisor,

217
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,600
There was an incident on Bus 45.

218
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
The person who was in that accident was also my student.

219
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,640
She was your student?

220
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,950
As soon as she just got off the bus,

221
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,080
she was hit by a big truck.

222
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,110
She died on the spot.

223
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,140
During that time, I had nightmares for a month.

224
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,210
I would always dream about that afternoon

225
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,780
when the police called me to come to confirm the body.

226
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,620
I'm so thankful that this time, nothing happened to you.

227
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,980
Advisor,

228
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,480
that student you mentioned earlier

229
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,860
was her name Wang Mengmeng?

230
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,430
Go help out with the statements of the other passengers on the bus.

231
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,350
I'll be responsible for these two youngsters.

232
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,050
- No, with your condition...
- Don't worry.

233
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,020
I won't overstep my boundaries.

234
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,930
I know my limits.

235
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,150
What did you say?

236
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,760
That's right. The bus driver today was Wang Mengmeng's father.

237
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,650
How is that possible?

238
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,990
Mengmeng's accident happened on Bus 45.

239
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,550
Why would her father...

240
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,120
This incident happened five years ago.

241
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,600
How do you two know about Mengmeng?

242
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,500
She often rides Bus 45, so she knows the bus driver. He told her himself.

243
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,260
That's right. Also, when we were on the bus,

244
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,430
Wang Mengmeng's parents were very emotional.

245
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,490
They sounded like they were continuously investigating something.

246
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,860
If it wasn't for the police who arrived just on time,

247
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,120
it's unfathomable to think what could have happened.

248
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,690
So, Advisor, could you tell us

249
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,090
what really happened back then?

250
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,380
Why would these two want to kill everyone on the bus?

251
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,590
To be honest, I don't know the specific details either.

252
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:37,650
But I know that Mengmeng's parent's never asked the school for anything.

253
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,740
Back then, the police were able to close the investigation soon after the accident.

254
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,240
They also signed the compensation contract.

255
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,840
Afterward, I didn't pay too much attention to the case.

256
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,880
What about the people on the bus?

257
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,030
Were there other students too? Did they see anything in particular?

258
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:58,120
Or at school, there must have been a lot of discussions, right?

259
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,410
It's fine. It's none of your business.

260
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,990
I think we need to talk with a police officer about this situation.

261
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:18,750
[Don't forget the principle, remember the mission.]

262
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,780
Chief Du.

263
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,320
Chief Du, I have reported the interrogation to Chief Xia.

264
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,880
Xiao Yuan is conducting an interview

265
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,780
with the witnesses from the bus.

266
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,010
How are the two youngsters who called the police doing?

267
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,530
Jiang Feng has been watching over them in the hospital. Let me contact him.

268
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,580
- There is definitely something wrong with these two people.
- Come back.

269
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,590
I know. Since Old Zhang is gone,

270
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,360
we are all hiding our emotions.

271
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,130
But we need to remain calm especially in these moments.

272
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,150
Don't jump to conclusions.

273
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,910
Do you understand?

274
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,430
- I understand.
- I understand.

275
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,260
Go.

276
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,510
When the incident happened back then,

277
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:35,330
There were a lot of web discussions on the university's school website about Wang Mengmeng.

278
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,490
But those were all blocked by IT soon after the incident.

279
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,390
The school would not allow any more discussion on this.

280
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,810
Adviser, what kind of girl was Wang Mengmeng?

281
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,090
Mengmeng is a really good girl.

282
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,310
She is shy and does not like to talk to others.

283
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,890
So that's why she had very few friends.

284
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,460
But she is definitely not someone who would do something without reason.

285
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,180
and request to get off the bus in the middle of the road.

286
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,380
That's what Wang Xingde said also.

287
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,450
Adviser Wu, are we still able to see the posts on the University website?

288
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,120
All the posts were blocked.

289
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,700
I do not have access rights either.

290
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,680
Probably you would need to look for the university website administrator.

291
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,490
Advisor Wu, I hope you can assist with our investigation.

292
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,890
I should get permission from my boss.

293
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,770
There is no time to wait for the approval.

294
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,630
If anything happens, I will take full responsibility. Let's go.

295
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,610
Let's make a trip to the university now.

296
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,590
I'll go too.

297
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,270
Officer Jiang, I know you are still suspicious of us.

298
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,930
But can you believe us just this once?

299
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,910
Just like...

300
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,140
Just the way Captian Zhang believed us for once.

301
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,560
There are officers outside.

302
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,980
If there is anything, let us know immediately.

All those people were all taking pleasure from another person's misfortune.

308
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,510
Wang Mengmeng was clearly the victim.

309
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,720
Why would they curse her like this?

310
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,430
After all, it's anonymous.

311

They think they can say whatever they want without taking any responsibility.

Let me take a look at the third post.

Right, this one.

- She is not crazy. She met a pervert on the bus.

320

This person's tone sounded very firm.

321

It's probably not a guess.

322

This person made the comment three days after Wang Mengmeng's incident.

This comment section was blocked that very day.

[Good idea! You're so smart.]

328
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,800
[I just want to ask, if you see a pervert, wouldn't you call the police? Why are you still posting about this days after it happened?]

329
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,960
[They killed a person. Hurry up and post more news!]
[Those who witnessed the death should go die too!]

330
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,220
Even if this person knew something, they would be afraid to speak up after this.

331
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,580
Wait a minute.

332
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,320
The IP address looks the same as many other people.

333
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,210
It's probably sent from a dorm room.

334
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,350
- Can we check to see which building this it's from?
- Can you help us search?

335
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,350
Okay, wait a minute.

336
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,130
I found it. Building number 3, room 324.

337
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,700
Advisor Wu, could you help us find all of the users of that IP address from that time period?

338
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,570
This happened a while ago and the schools' folders are constantly being updated.

339
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,680
I can only do my best to help you out during this short time we have.

340
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,770
We can help you look for it together.

341
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,050
Advisor Wu, the situation is critical.

342
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,790
This case has significantly affected the society.

343
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,130
We have even sacrificed a famous police officer because of this.

344
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,630
I have to investigate the course of events and the reason why Wang Mengmeng got off the bus.

345
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,990
This must be the reason behind this tragedy.

346
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,450
Advisor Wu, I hope you can understand our work.

347
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,230
Li Shiqing, I will call a car for you

348
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,760
and send you to the team to help them out with the interrogation.

349
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,610
I will take care of the rest myself.

350
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,750
Officer Jiang.

351
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,820
You are a police officer. If you stress out

352
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,830
the witness during the interrogation,

353
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,380
the witness could avoid answering your questions or remain silent.

354
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,150
But I am a student, so if I talk to the witness,

355
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,050
the witness won't feel pressured.

356
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,400
Therefore, I think you need a person like me to help you out with the interrogation.

357
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,630
Hello? Jiang Feng, what happened this time?

358
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,620
People from the hospital told me you had already left.

359
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,590
Didn’t I ask you to bring back the people who called the police?

360
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,310
Where are you now?

361
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,730
I have found some new clues here and I am investigating the surroundings.

362
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,660
What clues? I'm going to ask Chief Du about that right away.

363
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,680
Regarding the witness from the past accident involving Bus 45.

364
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,580
How could you not report such an important finding?

365
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,490
Where are you now? We are sending a team to assist you.

366
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,440
No need for that now. I will send a team to report to you about that as soon as possible.

367
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,530
Room 324 from building number 3 is from a girls' dorm.

368
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,550
All of the data from that time could be found here. Let's divide these and look through them.

369
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,850
All right, give it to me.

370
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,710
324...

371
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,130
It's right here. 324.

372
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,380
[Liu Yao]

373
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,610
Liu Yao! Liu Yao! We're in big trouble!

374
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,690
What is going on? Slow down a little bit or you will fall down.

375
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,620
Look. Bus 45 had an explosion.

376
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,150
Remember I told you that I took this bus in the past?

377
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,280
Even now, just thinking about it gives me some terrible flashbacks.

378
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,790
Liu Yao. Liu Yao? What's wrong?

379
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,350
It's nothing.

380
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,420
Your shift is over, you should go back home now.

381
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,990
Then you shouldn't stay overtime either.

382
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,660
Just let me finish computing this and I will go home, okay?

383
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,310
Okay, I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

384
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,410
Okay. Bye-bye.

385
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,240
[Explosive found on a bus, a hero police officer saved everyone.]

386
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,860
I’m sorry, we are closing.

387
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,740
Liu Yao.

388
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,330
Advisor Wu?

389
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,850
Can we talk?

390
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,520
On the 16th of May, five years ago,

391
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,550
you left a comment on our school's forum.

392
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,630
It was around 3:00 a.m., take a look.

393
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,890
Do you still remember?

394
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,460
What we want to know is why you would reply like this back then?

395
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,220
Did you know something?

396
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,330
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't post this.

397
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,530
The network interface from the campus is connected to each dorm room.

398
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,800
I've asked your roommate. On that evening,

399
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,420
you were the only one that was online.

400
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,080
You asked my roommate?

401
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,050
What are you guys planning to do?

402
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,800
Senior Sister, don't be nervous.

403
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,620
We really only want to know the reason for you to say something like this.

404
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,480
Did you see or hear something?

405
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,310
No, I don't know anything. I just randomly sent it.

406
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,310
Ms. Liu, please cooperate with us.

407
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,460
There's a connection between this and today's bus bombing.

408
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,690
Who are you?

409
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,750
You called the police already?

410
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,660
I hope you can cooperate with our investigation. Let me repeat it once more,

411
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,600
there's a connection between that and today's bus bombing.

412
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,150
Bombing?

413
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,930
What's that supposed to mean?

414
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,720
How does today's bombing have anything to do with me?

415
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,230
Senior Sister, I was a passenger on that bus today.

416
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,090
The people who planned the bombing were Wang Mengmeng's parents.

417
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,920
They want to retaliate against society because of Wang Mengmeng's death.

418
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,160
There are people who died because of this explosion.

419
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,650
Do you know how serious the situation is?

420
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,650
I hope you won't hide anything from us.

421
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,650
Liu Yao, regarding the event from the past,

422
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,050
if you know something about it, I hope you can explain to us the truth behind it.

423
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,130
I guarantee there won't be anyone who will hold you responsible for anything.

424
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,920
You are saying that so easily.

425
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,070
Will your guarantee have any value?

426
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,160
Why should I trust you?

427
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
I'm your advisor. Of course I need to protect you.

428
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,650
That's correct. At school,

429
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,590
teachers can protect me.

430
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,790
But what about outside the school?

431
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:57,520
If your guarantee had any value, then would Wang Mengmeng still have suffered all of that criticism?

432
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,450
If I remember correctly, her mother was also a teacher.

433
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,320
You also saw what the people were saying in that post?

434
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,820
They didn't care if you got revenge or not.

435
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,220
They only measure you against the standard of a saint who can do no wrong.

436
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,260
So once my information is leaked, the only person who is going to get the blame is me.

437
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,420
None of you can help me.

438
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,200
Liu Yao.

439
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,370
I'm an officer from the City Criminal Investigation Team.

440
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,370
My name is Jiang Feng.

441
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,500
I want to guarantee that

442
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,200
the police will never disclose your information to anyone.

443
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,760
Don't be nervous.

444
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,650
We didn't come here to put the blame on you.

445
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,390
Senior Sister, in fact, in your heart

446
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,920
you still want to speak the truth out loud, isn't it?

447
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,300
Otherwise, you wouldn't have responded that way back then.

448
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,030
Right?

449
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,860
I believe that these past years for you

450
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,190
have been torturous.

451
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,250
So tell us.

452
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:03,930
Let's untie this knot together.

453
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,760
That year,

454
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,560
why did you make that post?

455
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,500
Five years ago, when Wang Mengmeng was involved in that incident,

456
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,370
were you also on the bus with her?

457
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,620
If I told you,

458
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,400
can you guarantee

459
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,030
that I will be safe?

460
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,820
I promise you at the cost of losing my job.

461
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,850
I'm really scared.

462
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,360
I didn't mean to hide anything at all

463
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,650
I actually wanted to report it to the police at the time.

464
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,330
But I...

465
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,220
I was scared that he would take revenge on me.

466
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,090
Who is this person?

467
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,460
It's a middle-aged man who wore glasses.

468
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,270
He was molesting Wang Mengmeng.

469
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,500
So you mean you saw it.

470
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,320
Not only did I see it,

471
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,760
I also took a picture.

472
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,830
Do you have a picture?

473
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,290
I took it by accident.

474
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,880
And he noticed me.

475
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,400
Do you still have that picture?

476

485
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:43,970
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

486
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,610
♫  You are my only  ♫

487
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,750
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

488
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,390
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

489
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,820
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

490
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:14,330
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

491
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:21,990
♫  You are my only  ♫

492
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:29,670
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

493
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,400
♫  I will never leave  ♫

494
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,990
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

495
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:47,960
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

496
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,800
♫  To me  ♫
