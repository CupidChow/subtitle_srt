It was just a traffic accident.

The bus company took care of the compensation process.

The victim's parents didn't file a lawsuit,

When we watched this footage earlier,

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,520
we saw that Wang Mengmeng was very agitated when she got off the bus.

138
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,500
And she was arguing with you and also physically trying to get you to let her get off the bus.

139

What exactly happened?

It's been five years since this accident happened.

The police have asked me about all the details already.

- Yes, it's me.

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,710
Then you know this situation better than anyone else.

144
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,490
Please tell them for me.

145
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,120
- Back then, I already answered all the questions the police asked. All I can do now is...
- Driver Zhu.

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,320
You heard about today's explosion, right?

147
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,840
This is a critical case. I hope you can cooperate with the investigation.

148
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,320
Back then, that young lady

149
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,540
was desperate to get off the bus.

150
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,480
I really didn't think

151
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,280
that the car accident would happen as a result.

152
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,680
If I had known, I definitely wouldn't have let her get off the bus.

153
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,250
But at the time, under those circumstances,

154
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,620
I had to let her get off the bus.

155
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,620
I'm sure you've all seen the surveillance footage from the bus.

156
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,030
At the time, she was pulling on my arm.

157
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,180
If my steering wheel went in the wrong direction, what would happen?

158
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,380
The aftermath would have been unimaginable.

159
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,620
I'm a driver. I need to ensure

160
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,510
the safety of all passengers on board.

161
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,140
And if we had been somewhere else,

162
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,970
I could have pulled over to let her get off the bus,

163
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,720
but we were on the bridge. There wasn't anything I could do.

164
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,330
Why didn't you ask the other passengers to hold her back?

165
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,710
At the time, none of the passengers were trying to help.

166
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,150
After the accident, did Wang Mengmeng's parents look for you

167
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,920
to ask about the real reason she got off the bus?

168
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,260
Even if you gave me the courage,

169
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,820
I could never face them.

170
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,250
At the time, I knew that,

171
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,470
even if I knelt down and bowed to them, they wouldn't accept it.

172
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,200
Especially that lady, every time she–

173
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,600
Yes, I know.

174
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
I did break the

175
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,460
regulations while driving.

176
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,100
I know that. I even lost my job because of this.

177
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,770
I've admitted my mistake too.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,640
How much do you know about why Wang Mengmeng wanted to get off the bus?

179
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,290
Or did she tell you anything about it?

180
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,640
That young lady had gone past her stop.

181
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,650
I've seen that happen several times.

182
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,750
She kept talking while running back and forth across the bus. None of what she was saying made sense.

183
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,460
I didn't know what she was trying to do either.

184
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,630
All I knew was she desperately wanted me to stop the bus and let her get off.

185
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,630
At the time, I was focused on driving.

186
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,410
I-I-I didn't know what to do either!

187
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,600
It's the bridge! You can't stop a vehicle on there!

188
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,950
But you still stopped the bus.

189
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,910
Yes, yes. I know I stopped the bus, but so what?

190
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,760
It's been five years since this happened!

191
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,730
Are you going to punish me because of this forever?

192
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,940
- Didn't you bring me here today to interrogate me about my crimes again?
- No, no, no.

193
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,690
- Fine then. Give me the death penalty. I'll give my life as compensation for hers!
- Driver Zhu.

194
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,310
That's not what we meant. Please, sit.

195
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,200
Driver Zhu, please calm down.

196
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,990
- You don't need to be so agitated
- That's not what we meant.

197
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,940
We only brought you here because we wanted to ask if you remember

198
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,620
if the parents were very upset at the time, or if they seemed very angry or resentful.

199
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,440
Resent?

200
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
How could they not be resentful?

201
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,430
I'm resentful too.

202
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,560
All right, Driver Zhu.

203
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,320
Please calm down.

204
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,660
Let's all take some time to calm down. Xiao Liu.

205
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,970
Take Driver Zhu over there to have some tea and rest for a bit.

206
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,690
Driver Zhu, come this way. You can rest for a bit.

207

[Emergency Room]

208
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,020
- Mrs. Zhang.
- Where's Lao Zhang?

209
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,610
I'm asking you! Where is he?

210
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,350
We carefully studied the surveillance footage on the bus.

211
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,430
We also interviewed all the bus passengers.

212
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,760
No one knew why Wang Mengmeng wanted to get off the bus. We only found out that

213
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,460
she was interfering with the bus driver and preventing him from driving safely.

214
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,060
Other than her desperation to get off the bus,

215
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,140
there was no evidence to show that she had been threatened in any way.

216
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,080
But looking at the case record,

217
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,090
it seems like Tao Yinghong was very sure about this.

218
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,240
She was sure that Wang Mengmeng must have wanted to get off the bus

219
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,120
because her safety had been threatened on the bus.

220
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,620
Yes, she kept fixating on this idea.

221
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,280
Let's watch the surveillance footage again.

222
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,970
Who is she calling here?

223
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,810
Wang Xingde.

224
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,090
She called him, but he didn't pick up.

225
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,140
Driver, I want to get off the bus!

226
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,950
Driver. I want to get off the bus!

227
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,030
I can't stop the bus before we get to the next station.

228
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,170
Please pull over up there and let me get off. I'm begging you!

229
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,200
We're getting on the bridge, I definitely can't stop up there.

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,500
- I want to get off the bus!
- Get off me! What are you doing?

231
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,700
Get off me!

232
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,040
I want to get off!

233
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,580
What you're doing is extremely dangerous!

234
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,000
- Stop the bus!
- Stop moving around!

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,350
- Don't touch the steering wheel!
- Stop the bus!

236
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,980
I'll stop the bus. Stop moving around.

237
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,200
Pause it.

238
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,480
Look. At this point, the bus driver has already opened the doors, so she could already get off the bus.

239
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,260
But why is she looking back? Who is she looking at?

240
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,640
There were too many other passengers on the bus. Regarding who she was looking at,

241
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,150
we aren't clear.

242
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,540
But why was she so desperate to get off the bus?

243
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,840
We tried to figure this out before as well.

244
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,580
This section of Bus 45's route

245
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,510
is where many disputes take place.

246
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,480
Yanjiang East Road is the last stop before crossing the bridge.

247
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,300
If passengers miss their stop here,

248
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,570
they can only cross the bridge and then come all the way back across the bridge.

249
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,660
This process takes well over ten minutes.

250
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,730
But people often miss their stop here

251
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,070
and ask to get off before crossing the bridge.

252
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,530
Our guess was that Wang Mengmeng had also missed her stop.

253
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,740
So then, this case is actually quite simple.

254
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,710
There is plenty of evidence as well.

255
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,030
And after the accident, all three parties accepted the police's decision of who should take responsibility for the accident

256
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,030
and signed off on the police's decision.

257
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,190
The driver also paid the necessary compensation

258
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,150
- and all the financial compensation was paid out.
- That's right.

259
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,230
When they signed off on the police's decision,

260
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,800
what were Wang Xingde and Tao Yinghong's attitudes?

261
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,130
In the beginning, they refused to accept it.

262
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,760
They investigated on their own for over a month.

263
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,870
Every day, they would take Bus 45.

264
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,940
On the bus, if they saw

265
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,260
any girls that looked around the same age as Wang Mengmeng, they would start interrogating them

266
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,880
about whether they had been harassed on the bus before.

267
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,000
On the police decision report,

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,610
I see that only Wang Xingde signed it.

269
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,370
Was Tao Yinghong there at the time?

270
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,560
Does she know about this?

271
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,180
She was there. She knew what happened.

272
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,260
After the accident happened,

273
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,880
Tao Yinghong was the first to come here from their hometown,

274
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,910
so in the early stages of the investigation, we mainly communicated with her.

275
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,200
But as the investigation continued,

276
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,810
she began to lose control of her emotions.

277
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,750
This made it difficult for us to continue investigating.

278
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,240
So, after that, we tried our best to avoid her.

279
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,870
We mainly communicated with Wang Xingde instead.

280
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,270
When Wang Xingde signed off, Tao Yinghong was there too, and she was aware of what was going on.

281
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,380
After that, did either of them

282
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,620
question the police's decision at all?

283
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,320
No, they didn't.

284
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,010
Yezi. Is there any news from Jiaodao?

285
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,610
Yes. We contacted the other teachers that taught at Jiaodao First High School with Tao Yinghong.

286
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,340
They said that Tao Yinghong was indeed emotionally unstable.

287
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,680
After Wang Mengmeng's accident, Tao Yinghong's personality changed dramatically. She easily became angry.

288
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,520
She even physically hit students. Not long after that, she left the school.

289
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,480
Although, I think she was probably asked to leave

290
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,180
because the parents of the student that she hit caused quite a scene at the school.

291
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,540
After she left, she never contacted any of her coworkers.

292
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,680
She also blocked all of their calls.

293
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,000
And then, she moved to Jialin.

294
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,180
What about Wang Xingde?

295
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,840
We contacted some of Wang Xingde's old apprentices.

296
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,100
They said that Wang Xingde became very unhappy and morose.

297
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,500
It was like he aged several years at once.

298
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,290
But he never discussed the accident with anyone else.

299
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,880
Did anyone say anything about the state of their relationship?

300
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,980
His apprentice said that Wang Xingde always listened to Tao Yinghong for everything.

301
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,870
Moving to Jialin was probably Tao Yinghong's decision.

302
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,540
At first, Wang Xingde didn't want to move, but Tao Yinghong made up her mind.

303
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,850
Wang Xingde had no choice but to move here with her.

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,390
Captian Zhang's contact information?

309
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,430
Captian Zhang told us himself.

310
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,040
When did he tell you?

311

Did you know each other before?

You can say that we knew him,

but this is not something we can explain in one or two sentences.

Do you really have nothing to tell us?

322
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,360
About your daughter,

323
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,420
you also have nothing to say to us?

324
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,870
What are the purposes of this bombing?

325
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,370
Except for Tao Yinghong, do you have other accomplices?

326
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,360
Have you planned another bombing site?

327
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,750
Is Tao Yinghong okay?

328
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,990
If it wasn't for those two police officers on the bus,

329
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,120
our family

330
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,850
would have been reunited by now.

331
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,580
Are the two police officers she mentioned the two youngsters that called the police?

332
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,810
Are the two police officers you mentioned

333

334
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,250
I want to know.

335

You can follow me this whole time.

336
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,930
But when I asked you to investigate

337
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,630
the truth behind Mengmeng's death back then,

338
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,400
why did you close the case so hastily?

339
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,200
Tao Yinghong,

340
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,530
what I'm showing you here is all the information regarding Wang Mengmeng's case five years ago.

341
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,660
If you cooperate with our interrogation, we will re-open the case and find out the truth.

342
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,130
I already said what I needed to say.

343
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,580
This was my own idea.

344
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,500
I made the bomb by myself.

345
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,340
I took the bomb to Bus 45.

346
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,780
There is nothing to do with Wang Xingde.

347
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,950
If you think there is an association between us, it's because we are husband and wife.

348
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,360
It's because I forced him to.

349
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,530
It's because I want him to die with me.

350
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,060
Tao Yinghong, I understand that you are holding a grudge.

351

As parents,

366
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,950
when your child was at risk,

367
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,840
you couldn't protect her at that moment.

368
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,800
Not to mention

369
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,780
Mengmeng's last call was calling you for help.

370
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,720
If I could have picked up that call,

371
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,470
how great would that be?

372
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,610
If I can,

373
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm willing to use my life

374
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,770
in exchange for Mengmeng's.

375
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,400
What do those people know?

376
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,230
How can they casually spread rumors

377
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,590
of those they don't know on the internet?

378
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,000
They wrote those nasty comments.

379
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,440
Mengmeng was only twenty years old.

380
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,290
She never hurt anyone.

381
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,700
At that time,

382
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,910
if there were any clues or slight hope,

383
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,680
we wouldn't come to this stage today.

384
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,420
Five years ago, I threatened Tao Yinghong

385

to move from Jiaodao to Jialin.

386

I am the person behind it.

I forced Tao Yinghong to make it,

390
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,540
but there was nothing we could do.

391
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,760
She was our daughter.

392
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:41,210
I need to give her closure.

393
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,220
I can't let her die without any reason.

394
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,400
Let me ask you.

395
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,990
Is it wrong for us to do this?

396
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,450
You cannot use that as an excuse to commit a crime.

They also have children and parents.

onto those innocent people and ruined their families.

401

Do you think your behavior

402
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,320
was what Mengmeng wanted to see?

482
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,910
listen to me.

483
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,890
Yinghong.

484
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,880
Look at me.

485
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,400
Look at me.

486
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,580
Let's bring Mengmeng home.

487
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,320
Mengmeng must want to go home.

488
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:48,080
Also, all your graduating students

489
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,160
are all waiting for you.

490
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,950
Those students all need you too.

491
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,320
Mengmeng is gone.

492
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,640
The rest of our days

493
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,130
we'll have to live with memories.

494
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,760
''My Only'' - Zhou Shen

495
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,990
♫  You are the only  ♫

496
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:55,800
♫  The only one who heals me  ♫

497
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,920
♫  When I look into your eyes  ♫

498
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:09,420
♫  I heard my heart beat  ♫

499
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,660
♫  You are my only  ♫

500
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:26,380
♫  Always believed in me  ♫

501
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,610
♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

502
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:34,410
♫  I'll be strong with you by me  ♫

503
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:41,590
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

504
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:48,390
♫  You are my only  ♫

505
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,130
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

506
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:02,020
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

507
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,420
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

508
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:12,040
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

509
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:19,550
♫  You are my only  ♫

510
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:27,270
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

511
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,990
♫  I will never leave  ♫

512
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:36,660
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

513
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:45,520
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

514
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,350
♫  To me  ♫
