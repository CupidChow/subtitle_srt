You were wasting so much time earlier.

168
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,180
I sat there for so long. How come you didn't move?

169
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,790
I was waiting for that intersection.

170

I'm afraid that if we were to cause a commotion, the driver slows down, and we'll meet with the red light and you know...

I was quite reasonable then.

No, what I mean is that just plain arguing doesn't have a point to make.

This time you need to find a better strong point then.

180
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,280
Let's not act anymore. Just use brute force to get him under control.

181

Brute force to get him under control? Can you do it?

182
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,400
No, just now, I was unaware. He scratched me.

183
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,440

184

It can't be him, right?

191
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,770
Perhaps it's a report message to his accomplice.

without any preparation beforehand, when he opens his eyes

313
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,930
and is anxious and scared, he may cause the loop to go on for another two or three times when he's desperate to get out of the bus.

314
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,190
Then...

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,280
And besides, he didn't even board the bus in the first place. That doesn't fit the qualifications.

321
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,140
His foot already stepped onto the bus.

322
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,830
Did he go through the bus door?

323
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,630
Did the bus door close? Did the bus drive yet?

324
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,620
He's not the chosen one.

325
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,740
But what if he is?

326
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,940
Okay, okay, okay. Let me act it out for you.

327
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,140
Come here.

328
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,880
Sit.

329
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,000
Let's speculate that the both of us waking up at the same time signifies the start of a current loop.

330
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,870
And as the time we wake up gets earlier each time,

331
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,230
then when would he wake up? At the platform of the bus stop?

332
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,950
Or on the way to the bus stop?

333
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,100
- This...
- Besides, even if we don't wake up simultaneously,

334
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,230
if we wait for him to board the bus, fall asleep, and then wake up,

335
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,710
this valid time frame is too short.

336
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,360
It would explode very fast, there's not enough time at all.

337
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,940
Wouldn't we know how he wakes up after we try so?

338
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,540
And I think, even if he were not to enter into the loop,

339
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,950
it wouldn't be a big deal if we told him. He's going to forget everything anyway.

340
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,250
Didn't you say before to make the most sufficient preparations but still be prepared for the worst?

341
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,250
I'm just afraid since he has asthma.

342
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,470
This is how I feel personally. After several loops,

343
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,460
my strength has been intensified.

344
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,640
Look how I grabbed him, it was so easy.

345
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,140
The cat savior rescued another cat today?

346
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,620
It's Cat Apostle.

347
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,630
All right, Apostle.

348
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,710
The intersection between Yanjiang East Road and Qiushi Road

349
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,250
had a serious car accident. Bus 45

350
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,060
collided into a oil tanker and caused explosion.

351
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,140
Many causalities occured at the scene. After the accident,

352
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,460
the local leaders from our city provided high priority to the case.

353
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,910
The police, fire department, and emergency units...

354
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,890
There aren't many people here and the internet speed is pretty fast.

355
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
You can sit wherever. You can place your order with this QR code.

356
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,680
All right, thank you.

357
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,710
Sit.

358
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,290
There aren't many people and the food here is not bad.

359
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,590
In the previous loops, I was working too hard.

360
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:14,330
I feel like my last meal was in my past life.

361
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,100
It's very strange, I don't feel hungry at all.

362
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,750
I've thought of this.

363
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,590
Everything tangible will not bring it to the next loop.

364
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,870
For example, wounds, also your body's energy consumption.

365
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,400
No wonder. I only had some fruit for lunch and I'm still not hungry.

366
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,380
Also, there is one more point. No matter how much money you spend now,

367
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,800
your money will replenish in your next loop.

368
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,500
But this is useless.

369
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,840
If we buy something now, we can't take it with us to the next loop.

370
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,150
Don't buy anything. Buy service, buy experience.

371
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,880
You can keep your experience.

372
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,200
Experience?

373
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,670
For example...

374
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,580
The most simple and what makes you feel good.

375
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,510
Eating! You can eat whatever!

376
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,420
You don't need to only eat fruits.

377
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,850
That's right.

378
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,430
That's right. The weight I'll gain after I eat won't stay.

379
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,910
Put down your phones, stop filming.

380
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,690
Stop filming.

381
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,130
I’m sorry, could you step aside and let me see for a moment?

382
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,830
- Why are you here?
- What are you doing?

383
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,160
Then if there’s nothing else, we’ll be leaving first.

384
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,420
Why did they come again?

385
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,440
What's going on?

386
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,470
What's wrong?

387
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,920
I suddenly feel a bit guilty.

388
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,520
There is a really big matter right in front of us.

389
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,890
How can we be here enjoying a meal?

390
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,360
There is a saying,

391
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,470
"Human is iron and rice is steel. You can only save the world when you are full."

392
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,200
It makes sense.

393
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,680
[Huge crash, photos below]

394
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,120
[My goodness! Bus 45 is what I take every day for work. Good thing I had a break today.]
[I hope not too many people were harmed]

395
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,990
The news remains the same, there aren't any updates.

396
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,810
I wonder when the police can find the explosive.

397
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,030
Even if they find it, they wouldn't report it immediately.

398
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,340
Who is it?

399
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,470
My colleague is asking me to attend the meeting again.

400
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,260
You can actually attend the meeting.

401
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,910
We managed to get off the bus stop this time and we didn't report it to the police.

402
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,020
We still have plenty of time.

403
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,350
I didn't want to attend from the beginning.

404
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,180
The most important thing right now is to solve the problem in front of us.

405
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,400
We cannot be separated.

406
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,060
In the evening, I will take you to the internet cafe.

407
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,840
We will spend the night there.

408
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,740
You don't want to go home?

409
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,170
We were forced to be in the previous loops.

410
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,590
Have you thought if we don't sleep or we take turns to sleep,

411
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,270
we can then delay the looping time?

412
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:50,340
For such a serious incident, the police must be running against time to solve the case.

413
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,580
The news will carry on reporting this accident. If we can sustain until the moment they found the culprit,

414
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,930
then when we enter the next loop, we can provide the clues

415
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,780
to the police.

416
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,210
What you mean is, we will eventually call the police?

417
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,540
I'm actually very scared of the interrogation room.

418
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,110
If the time is right, we must call the police.

419
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,620
What if we will automatically go back into the loop when it's midnight?

420
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,090
Last time when you went to the police station,

421
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,920
did you hear anything regarding the passengers?

422
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,830
Next time we go in, we cannot come out empty-handed.

423
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,090
We need to collect a few useful clues.

424
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:37,100
Now I'm thinking about it, the way we collect the information

425
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,460
is not as good as the police.

426
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,230
Now you're telling me that?

427
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,100
We need to see it as a way of development.

428
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,840
In the end, the news we have is too limited.

429
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,120
Look, just investigating a person, the explosive, how it was detonated,

430
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,660
just those three clues have wasted so much time in the loops.

431
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,300
The cost of production is too high.

432
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,670
If we can obtain some information through the police,

433
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,920
for example the list of the victims,

434
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,730
then we can use the list to find some clues.

435
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,290
How do we use the list to find clues?

436
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,570
Think about this, if among the passengers there are wanted criminals,

437
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,410
mental patients... Aren't they the most suspicious?

438
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,730
Then we can run a background check on them first.

439
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,380
Then, let's use this time to re-organize this.

440
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,610
We got off the bus stop normally and it won't end the loops.

441
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,650
Then the way to end the loop should be...

442
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,250
Stop the bus explosion?

443
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,150
I still have a question.

444
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,090
Are you in standby mode?

445
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,990
Standby mode?

446
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,520
What do you mean?

447
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,670
How should I explain?

448
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,610
When you went to the police station alone last time, didn't I call you?

449
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,240
After the call, I took a lot of melatonin and drank alcohol in order to fall asleep and re-enter the loop,

450
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,160
but then I realized that I didn't.

451
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,390
I had a very long and strange dream.

452
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,860
I had a dream too.

453
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,140
It was the time when both of us were under interrogation.

454
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,800
I should say I fell asleep first,

455
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,690
then I had a dream. But it was a sweet dream.

456
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,340
It means we need to both fall asleep at the same time in order to enter the loop together.

457
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,440
Otherwise, the other person will enter the standby mode I was talking about.

458
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,550
Standby mode.

459
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,350
If we put it this way,

460
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,020
if we cannot resolve a situation in the future,

461
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,120
we can enter the standby mode and then wait for the other person

462
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,720
to re-enter the loop together.

463
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,910
Where is the poster? Did the company not make Brother Yi's poster?

464
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,850
It's ready, Brother. The print shop will deliver it over later.

465
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,300
Then shall we broadcast the preview first?

466
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,090
Here, you don't need to worry about this. Just remember this point.

467
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,360
Get close to my face for the last close-up.

468
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Don't take in everything at once. My temper is quite progressive.

469
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,960
Okay, Brother, I got it.

470
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,010
Then, I'm going to take some long shots. You can go over the lines again.

471
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,480
You came this early? How are you going to hold this seat later?

472
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,780
- We have to share the space.
- Don't worry.

473
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,650
We can worry about it after Brother Yi's poster comes in.

474
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,730
Brother Yi's situation happened so suddenly.

475
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,630
He's really similar to the persona the company set up for him.

476
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,410
He talks a lot and is nosy.

477
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,220
However, he's an optimist. Everyone hates him,

478
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,090
but he doesn't hate anyone.

479
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,050
Hello, my viewers. For today's broadcast, our location

480
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,600
is outside. Everyone knows that this evening,

481
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,420
in Jialin City, at the crossroad right behind me,

482
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,380
a painful and tragic event occurred.

483
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,710
There was a crash between a bus and an oil tanker.

484
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,120
It caused multiple people to get injured.

485
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,150
I was talking with Brother Yi the other day. I said,

486
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,410
"Let's talk about Brother Yi's situation."

487
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,500
He started laughing and didn't say anything.

488
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,650
I can't believe that suddenly,

489
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,030
we departed like this.

490
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,770
Brother Yi,

491
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,360
I just want to tell you

492
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,510
that you'll always be our Brother Yi.

493
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,440
We will continue forward with your happiness.

494
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,550
Today, there will be a lot of Brother Yi's fans and friends.

495
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,020
They will come to commemorate him.

496
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,100
Let us see off our Brother Yi one last time.

497
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,650
Let us talk to him one last time.

498
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,380
Brother Yi,

499
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,130
farewell.

500
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,350
Farewell, Brother.

501
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,950
How about we go check it out later?

502
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,400
We can get to know the other passengers' information.

503
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,580
Sure.

504
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,420
[Goodbye, Brother Yi]

505
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,120
[Be Happy]

506
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,150
[Goodbye, Brother Yi]

507
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,050
Taking the bus is a pretty good choice to get things done.

508
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,240
I'm going to meet fans now, and I chose to go by bus.

509
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,000
Right? What's wrong with riding the bus? See?

510
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Look, this is a bus. There are not a lot of people, and it's very clean.

511
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,470
The most important thing is that you can see the scenery outside.

512
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,470
Look out the window behind me. Look at how beautiful it is.

513
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,890
Right?

514
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,000
The bus is carbon efficient. It's protecting the environment.

515
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,080
Were you trying to find something in my bag when you blocked me off the bus today?

516
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,430
No, it-it's a misunderstanding.

517
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,070
Misunderstanding.

518
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,220
Do you know how the bus exploded?

519
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,060
How would we know? Look at what you're saying...

520
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,430
Then you're here to save me, right?

521
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,640
This...

522
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,630
What do you mean?

523
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,780
Don't leave, I'm calling the police.

524
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,160
Don't, don't, don't.

525
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,070
No, no. It really is a misunderstanding.

526
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,860
This situation...

527
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,660
It's hard to explain.

528
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,150
Then come with me.

529
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,190
