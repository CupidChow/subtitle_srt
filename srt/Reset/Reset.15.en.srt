Hello? Hello, Mom? I...

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,200
I just met a pervert

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,850
on the bus.

12
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,910
What? What happened?

13
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,320
Were you bullied?

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
What's wrong?

15
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,110
Not me, it wasn't me. Mom. I saw a man

16
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,490
rubbing his private part against a girl.

17
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,540
What is going on with you?

18
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,650
You terrified me when you didn't speak clearly.

19
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,480
I thought something happened to you.

20
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,210
Mom, let me tell you, I... I took the picture of the pervert's face

21
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,990
with my phone.

22
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,260
Should I call the police now?

23
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,970
Did he see you when you took his picture?

24
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,860
I don't know,

25
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,420
but the pervert kept turning his head to look at me

26
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,420
and he walked toward me. I got off the bus because I was terrified.

27
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,440
Don't call the police. You study alone in a foreign city.

Even though you call the police,

30
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,330
this pervert will only stay in jail for a few days.

31
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,280
What if he retaliates on you?

32
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,160
I cannot imagine the consequences.

33
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,150
It shouldn't be like that.

34
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,930
How can it not?

35
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,730
If he remembers your face,

36
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,250
he can go to the bus stop or the school.

37
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,740
You cannot hide from him.

38

You saw this incident today.

Just let it go and pretend it didn't happen.

Okay, fine.

42
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,050
I told you before. When you go outside, don't wear those strange outfits.

43
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,220
Why do you bring it up again?

44
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,620
Why are you calling my clothes strange outfits?

45
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,310
Look at your skirts.

46
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,140
One is shorter than the other.

47
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,180
So much of your legs are showing.

48
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,190
A girl can be taken advantage of while dressing up like that.

These are modern times! How can you still say that?

Stop your nonsense.

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,060
there is no next loop.

158
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,040
It's just...

159
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,120
If...

160
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,800
we wake up the next day,

161
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,440
and we don't remember anything,

162
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,420
what should we do?

163
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,510
Anyways, I will always remember you.

164
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,940
Even if you forget me,

165
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,650
I will look for you, knock, open your door

166
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,140
and say to you,

167
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,790
hello, my name is Xiao Heyun.

168
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,360
Will you be my girlfriend?

169
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,590
I will.

♫  Always believed in me  ♫

172

♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

173

Xiao Heyun! Xiao Heyun!

188
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,650
Actually, ever since the starting time stopped moving back,

189
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,480
I've been able to tell that

190
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,890
my physical condition is deteriorating.

191
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,600
Perhaps, for me, the time loop isn't an infinite loop.

Look.

271
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,560
Mengmeng did meet a pervert that year.

272
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,650
That was why she got off the bus.

273
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,420
She didn't inflict herself.

274
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,120
She got off the bus because she was helpless and had no way out.

275
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,160
This photo is proof

276

she's innocent.

How did you know Mengmeng?

278
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,540
My advisor was also Mengmeng's advisor.

279
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,520
We've found the person who took this photo.

She can be our witness.

You just let everyone get off the bus and I can give the picture to the police.

We can clear Mengmeng's name, okay?

If you do this, you won't hurt that jerk.

289

This person still remains at large, why do you want to be dead?

290

We have evidence now to uncover the truth.

291

Don't let the truth be buried.

292

It's been so long,

293

nobody will believe it.

294
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,070
We believe it.

295
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,000
You also have to believe in the police,

You have to watch out for the person who hurt Mengmeng

301
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,220
and make sure the pervert is punished.

302
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,980
