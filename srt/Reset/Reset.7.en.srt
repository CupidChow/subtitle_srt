You should know about my situation.

Only two more months and I will be home.

How's the situation in there?

- Pretty good.
- Are there any issues with your health?

Nothing. I'm good.

I am so excited that I couldn't go to bed these past couple of days.

These years, I only think of one thing.

It's to work hard and maintain good behavior.

Requesting a sentence reduction

so that I could be home sooner. We could be reunited.

Finally, the day has come.

It's good.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,060
I have an idea. Once I'm home,

18
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,970
I will fix up that piece of land.

19
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,160
Keep that sandy plot for me.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,900
I still want to grow watermelons there.

21
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,740
For the rest of the plots, we could rent it out.

You sold the house?

You moved to the city?

Living in the city is good as well. It's all right.

There were no survivors on the bus.

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,700
That's why we hope to speak to the passengers who got on and off the bus along the way

66
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,540
in order to understand the situation on the bus.

67
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,890
I have gone through the bus stop surveillance cameras,

68
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,820
and we saw you guys got off the bus stop

69
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,840
right before the accident, is that right?

70
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,530
That's correct. It was the stop at Yanjiang East Road.

71
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,760
We didn't expect once we got off,

72
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,640
the bus would explode.

73
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,240
When I saw the surveillance camera,

74
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,820
it looked like you guys decided to get off the bus at the last minute.

75
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,280
This is the situation.

76
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,980
My boyfriend lost his backpack on this bus route a few days ago.

77
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,070
When we arrived at the Yanjiang East Road stop,

78
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,590
we saw a guy carrying the same backpack.

79
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,880
That's why we got off the bus and wanted to speak with him.

80
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,950
In the end, it wasn't the case.

81
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,590
Before he got on the bus, you've already found him carrying a similar bag?

82
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,130
Because he wore the bag on the front, it was easy to identify.

83
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,520
Why didn't you verify with him after he got on the bus?

84
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,490
Perhaps we were in a hurry.

85
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,860
We have asked the guy with the backpack,

86
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,330
he said you pushed him off the bus.

87
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,540
Then you unzipped his bag and examined the interior.

88
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,330
Correct?

89
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,020
Then I don't understand.

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,820
No matter if your boyfriend's bag was stolen or snatched,

after so many days,

92
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,120
do you think he would be carrying the same items?

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Why did you unzip the bag? What were you examining?

94
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,930
Can't you simply look at the exterior

95
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,250
to identify?

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,850
For that, we didn't think thoroughly.

When...

98
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,760
did you guys find out about the accident?

99
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,790
The guy had a kitten inside the backpack,

100
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,360
it escaped. The moment we found the cat,

101
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,790
we saw the explosion.

102
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,030
Were you surprised?

103
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
At the time, we were pretty surprised.

104
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,720
If we didn't get off earlier, we would have been...

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
That's right.

106
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,470
Where did you get on the bus?

107
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,290
Were you by yourself? How long had you been on the bus?

108
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,860
I got on the bus at Gaoxin District. I met my girlfriend on the same bus.

109
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,090
She got on the bus near the university campus. We were there for a dozen of bus stops.

110
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,110
For about an hour?

111
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,390
While you were on the bus, other than the backpack incident,

112
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,410
did you notice anybody suspicious?

113
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,720
Suspicious?

114
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,350
There were. There were two men that were acting strange.

115
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,950
One of them was a middle-aged man who sat next to us.

116
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,880
He had been playing on his phone since he got on the bus. He looked suspicious.

117
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,430
Then he carried this big suitcase. He would protect it from time to time.

118
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,020
He was quite strange.

119
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,790
Then there was this older guy who sat in the front.

120
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,410
He had a big canvas bag that seems to be watermelon,

121
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,340
but every time someone walked past him, he got very nervous.

122
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,940
For me, they felt unusual.

123
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,850
It's this person.

124
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,460
Ma Guoqiang.

125
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,230
Why would you think he looked suspicious?

126
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,880
- Get his information.
- Got it.

127
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,350
Look at this clip.

128
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,220
- Here.

130
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,270
In the comment section, netizens said this old man's facial expression was a bit scary.

131
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,270
Only after seeing this video clip, we recalled

132
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,720
that his behavior on the bus was a bit

133
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
nervous. It was quite strange.

134
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,360
All three testimonies are consistent. They said it was just a misunderstanding.

135
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,060
I see the other two were pretty cooperative.

136
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,230
They've told us everything they saw on the bus.

137
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,790
Weren't they a bit too cooperative?

138
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,020
In normal circumstances, they shouldn't know the situation of the case.

139
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,750
They shouldn't know there was a bomb on the bus.

140
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,670
But both of them pointed their fingers at Ma Guoqiang.

141
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,080
They suspected his canvas bag.

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,080
But Master, didn't we ask them what looked suspicious on the bus?

143
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,230
If you were an ordinary passenger, would you pay attention to all these details?

144
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,890
Do you care if a farmer carried a canvas bag?

145
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,850
Is this a normal thing to do?

146
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,470
When they work with the police, there are people who

147
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,600
cater for our demand.

148
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,860
I can totally understand.

149
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,000
Chief Du, Captain Zhang.

150
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,300
This is the passenger's information that the witnesses mentioned.

151
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,030
Ma Guoqiang, birthplace Ningxia.

152
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,610
In 2006,

153
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,280
while he was riding a tricycle, he hit and killed a person. It was a hit-and-run.

154
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,960
He ran away for four years. He was captured and arrested in 2010.

155
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,910
He was sentenced to 9 years. He was released early in 2017.

156
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,650
Now, he is farming back in his hometown.

157
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,870
Ma Guoqiang came to Jialin this morning from the bus.

158
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,320
After he was released from prison, he was always cultivating watermelons in his hometown.

159
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,700
He lives alone. His son and ex-wife are also residing in Jialin.

160
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,020
Right now, their psychological state is unclear. They may have financial disputes.

161
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,750
- Did his family members arrive?
- Yes.

162
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,380
We're notifying them about the case one by one. It should almost be done by now.

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,580
Old Zhang, assess the situation.

164
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,250
- Sure.
- Should we release the three youngsters?

165
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,650
Release them first.

166
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,120
- Let them keep their phones on at all times.
- Okay.

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
Wait for a moment.

168
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,350
I think we can release Li Shiqing first.

169
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,920
We can track her with her phone and see where she goes after we release her.

170
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,710
Let's first keep these other two.

After I've met up with Ma Guoqiang's relatives,

172
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,840
I want to talk to these other two again.

173
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,850
I still feel that

174
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,050
there's something off here.

175
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,350
Old Wang was such a good person,

176
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,280
how could he do something like that?

177
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,400
That's right.

How long has it been since you've seen your father, Ma Guoqiang?

182
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,240
Did he notify you that he was coming to visit?

183
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,430

What matter?

I want to wait here a bit for my boyfriend. After he comes out, we can go together.

Your father came to Jialin this morning.

226
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,390
We didn't know he was coming.

227
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,780
These past few years, our ties were cut off.

228
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,150
He did make a few calls saying that he wanted to come visit us,

229
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,140
but I didn't agree.

230
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,450
Why?

231
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,360
Just because that year

232
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,780
he had a hit-and-run?

233
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,720
The year the accident happened,

234
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,930
I was preparing for the high school entrance exam.

235
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,860
We couldn't convince him to turn himself in.

236
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,670
Afterward, he hid for a few years,

237
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,310
but we really couldn't make the effort to find him.

238
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,820

After he was put behind bars,

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,550
we lost contact,

242
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,850
but my mom and I were the ones who were paying

243
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,800
the compensation money for court.

244
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,180
My mom always thought that it wasn't easy for me to be alone in a big city.

245
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,050
He wanted to come visit us a few times but I never let him.

246
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,020
Did the victim go to the same school as you?

247
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,810
Yes.

248
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,030
He was my classmate.

249
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,990
Did you finish paying the compensation money?

250
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,420
Not yet.

251
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,350

threaten you or your mother

257

or reveal that they wanted to take revenge on your father?

258

260

- what's the relation between today's accident and that family?
- What?

what is the relation between today's accident and that family?

Based on what we know, your father

271
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,670
has some financial disputes, is that correct?

272
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,260

Why did they call over there alone?

276
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,180
What did they ask you?

Nothing much, Mom. Sit down first.

if there are any disputes,

280

or if it was someone trying to seek revenge.

281

What?

282
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,380

Why are still speaking about this?

293

Then...

294
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,460
If it really is because of your dad,

295
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,370
because someone was coming to seek revenge

296
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,840
and then caused such harm to a bus full of people,

297
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,280
then we...

298
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,450
how many murder cases do we have on our back? How are we supposed to compensate?

299
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,940

After I come back, I'll take you to talk with Officer Zhang.

314
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,320
I'm going to use the restroom. Afterward, I'll go take my mom to Officer Zhang.

315
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,630
No problem.

317
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,450
It's al right, Auntie. Don't worry.

I'm not.

322
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,980
I rode on that bus, so I'm here to cooperate with the investigation.

On that bus,

did you meet an old man carrying a big sack?

I do remember. There were watermelons in his sack.

00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,340
and I saw watermelon skin.

329
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,870
That was my dad.

330
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,930
It's all my fault.

331
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,040
It's all my fault.

332
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,480
Why do you say that?

333
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,330
He went to jail for seven years.

334
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,710
After he came out, he was disconnected from society.

335
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,710
What was I afraid of?

336
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,670
It's all my fault.

337
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,170
Then...

338
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,570
Your dad...

339
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,480
did he come to Jialin to find you?

340
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,370
It's my fault.

341
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,740
It's all my fault.

342
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,360
- Where is he?
- Auntie, don't be nervous?

343
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,310
- Here?
- Yes.

344
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,420
- Right here.
- Auntie, promise us that you'll stay calm.

345
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,520
- Okay?
- Okay.

346
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,540
- Lu Di!
- Mom!

347
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,020
Who did you want to donate your heart to?

348
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,540
- Auntie, calm down.
- Tell me!

349
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,090
Who did you want to donate your heart to?

350
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,420
- Why did you read my diary?
- Lu Di, Lu Di. Sit.

351
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,200
- Sit down.
- Calm down.
- What's going on?

352
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,250
Auntie, say it calmly.

353
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,530
Old Lu, take a look. Look at what your son has written.

354
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,150
I don't know who tricked him.

355
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,180
He said he was going to save people from the explosion with someone.

356
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,470
- Mom.
- Explosion?

357
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,310
No, Mom. I didn't want you to read my diary now.

358
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,290
It is too late to read your diary after you pass away.

359
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,160
Mom. Do you know it is illegal to intrude on my privacy?

360
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,820
- Illegal? What is wrong with
- Let's go out.

361
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,100
reading my own son's diary?

362
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,910
Ask Li Shiqing to come back. Put her and Xiao Heyun

363
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,640
into two separate two trial rooms. Don't let them meet one another.

364
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,670
Got it.

365
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,480
Tell me, what happened?

366
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,540
Hello?

367
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,790
Hello, Li Shiqing, can you come back to the police station?

368
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,050
Is there something else?

369
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,780
Where are you now?

370
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,970
I-I'm near the station.

371
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,770
I'll come find you.

372
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,970
Xiao Heyun, come with me.

373
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,330
Can I leave now?

374
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,710
Not yet.

375
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,750
- Then-Then where are we going?
- Come with me.

376
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,300
Lu Di.

377
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,490
- See?
- What is wrong with you?

378
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,410
No matter how anxious you were, you shouldn't read your child's letter. And you even make a scene here.

379
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,880
Is it a letter?

380
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,250
It is a will!

381
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,410
Did you understand it or not?

382
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,080
He got tricked by someone who claimed he is going to another world.

383
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,950
Maybe our child will be gone by then.

384
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,940
If it's gone, it's gone. Mom!

385
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,330
Why don't you think about my feelings? I don't care, Mom.

386
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,670
All these years, you think you were protecting me. But actually, you put me under house arrest.

387
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,640
I am a living person.

388
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,390
I have my own likes and pursuits.

389
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,880
I am not your accessory.

390
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,660
They chose me today. For 23 years, this is the first time I feel irreplaceable.

391
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,500
You don't understand. I don't need you to understand it either.

392
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,090
Did you hear? Did you hear what he just said?

393
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,780
Who... who chose you?

394
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,400
Why did they choose you?

395
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,310
To save the world.

396
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,560
That's right. Also, Anime City?

397
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,450
What is going on there?

398
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,570
Lu Di, Lu Di.

399
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,010
What are you hiding from us?

400
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,180
Enough!

401
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,290
When are you going to stop?

402
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,980
Whose child doesn't have a secret? He just rented a house.

403
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,750
- Rent a house?
- Dad.

404
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,470
You already knew he rented a house?

405
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,890
How did you know?

406
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,970
Lu Di, you... Tell me,

407
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,670
how can you make something up like that?

408
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,460
Enough!

409
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,080
What did he do?

410
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,420
Who is doing it? Who?

411
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,150
What do you mean?

412
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,110
After all these years,

413
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,090
did you respect him? Did we respect him?

414
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,230
How could I not respect him?

415
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,310
Okay, don't talk anymore. Let's go home. Officer.

416
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,670
- No... Auntie.
- Let's go.

417
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,050
Our child has grown up already. Save his face, can you?

418
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,270
Uncle, calm down. Auntie, we will take it outside.

419
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,100
Fine, fine, I beg you.

420
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,270
- I need to clarify this.
- Okay! Okay!

421
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,510
This way, Auntie.

422
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,290
Officer, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

423
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,060
It's fine.

424
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,790
Lu Di,

425
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,520
actually, back in the day,

426
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,830
I was also a huge fan of Cui Jian.
(T/N: Chinese legendary rocker)

427
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,870
Your mom was also a fan of Leslie Cheung and Sanmao.
(T/N: Leslie Cheung was a movie star and singer. Sanmao was a famous author.)

428
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,020
We were like you back then.

429
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,080
Thanks, Dad.

430
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,170
Cooperate with them.

431
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,090
Your mother and I will wait for you outside.

432
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,340
Okay.

433
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,260
Sit, quick, sit.

434
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,410
Sit down.

435
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,680
Thank you.

436
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,350
From Lu Di, we obtained some specific information regarding the explosion.

437
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,710
How exactly did you meet Lu Di?

438
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,950
Didn't I just say that?

439
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,880
Just, that day on the bus, the situation with the bag.

440
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,180
What information can you get from him?

441
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,020
Is this a question you should ask?

442
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,030
What you need to do now is to honestly answer all my questions.

443
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,500
Okay.

444
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,080
The first time I woke up,

445
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,270
the bus exploded.

446
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,450
The second time I woke up,

447
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,730
I thought it is a dream. The third time...

448
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,520
Li Shiqing,

449
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,020
Actually,

450
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,380
there's something wrong with my mind,

451
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,120
I was hit by a motorcycle a couple of days ago.

452
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,700
We don't understand what you just said,

453
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,230
but I want to remind you,

454
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,790
this is not your stage to perform on.

455
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,070
What you said about an adventure,

456
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,710
an explosion,

457
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,200
and saving passengers?

458
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Is that everything the two of them told you?

459
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,870
Time's already up, listen to me.

460
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,880
You two organize all the information in hand and send it to me simultaneously.

461
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,230
I could use it. I will save the world for you.

462
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,250
Saving the world, fine.

463
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,100
We can help you save the world too,

464
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,130
but you need to answer our questions first.

465
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,730
I have no way to answer that now, there's not enough time.

466
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,960
Lu Di, you don't need to worry,

467
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,420
there's enough time.

468
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,650
We can all take turns to accompany you.

469
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,510
Once it's midnight, everything will start over.

470
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,290
Hurry up!

471
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,260
Please believe me!

472
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,730
Xiao Heyun, did you know...

473
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,450
Okay,

474
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,830
I will tell you the truth. Okay?

475
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,480
I...

476
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,810
entered a time loop.

477
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,160
You thought that the car accident caused the explosion.

478
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,650
But at night, you will find a bomb on the bus.

479
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,160
Right? How would I know about this if I didn't enter a time loop?

480
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,460
I don't have enough time, I'm going to leave soon.

481
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,820
Tell me whatever you know now.

482
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,520
Tell me truthfully!

483
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,430
Xiao Heyun, since when did you start to plan this?

484

No, I didn't.

491
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,530
Officer Jiang said Lu Di wrote a will for his mom.

492
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,090
He told her that he was going to the loop with us.

493
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,310
Then what did you say?

494
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,300
What I said isn't important.

495
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,880
I don't want to go to the police station and talk about the loop anymore.

496
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,180
I'm about to puke!

497
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,130
Same here.

498
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,590
I have a huge clue.

499
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,170
That uncle has a criminal record.

500
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,410
He's carrying human life.

501
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,800
It means that he's killed someone before.

502
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,970
That bag of his is pretty strange.

503
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,800
How about we investigate him?

504
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,580
I'll go first to scout out the situation.

505
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,910
Y-You be careful.

506
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,800
He was being too careful with his bag.

507
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,180
There must be something suspicious.

508
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,230
[Arriving at Yanjiang East Road]

509
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,550
Don't we still have Lu Di?

510
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
That's right.

511
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,700
Careful!

512
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,950
Thank you.

513
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,690
Are you okay?

514
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,100
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated. The next stop is

515
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,130
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Yanjiang West Road Stop.

516
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,200
Thank you.

517
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,830
He didn't enter the loop.

518
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,640
Then why don't we just tell him the secret code?

519
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,120
Explaining everything to him now will waste too much time.

520
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,800
Let's act according to our plan for now.

521
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,400
If we need anything, we can tell him later.

522
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,120
What a pity. Now we have one less helper.

523
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,500
It's all right.

524
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,810
I've already thought of a plan.

525
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,690
Later, you...

526
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,290
I really don't know how you counted. This is clearly the fourth stop! How were you counting?

527
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,310
I counted on my fingers. We should get off at the fifth stop!

528
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,450
Come over here, show me how you counted on your fingers.

529
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,330
- See? See?
- Look yourself. Isn't this—

530
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,510
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. Sorry.

531
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,560
I'm sorry.

532
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,110
What are you doing? Why are you kicking my watermelon?

533
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,880
Hey! You're not allowed to fight! You're not allowed to fight! What are you doing?

534
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
It's him.

535
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,060
He kicked my watermelon first. He smashed two.

536
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,840
- I didn't push him on purpose.
- I didn't do it on purpose either.

537
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,700
You didn't do it on purpose either?

538
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,440
Sure, you didn't do it on purpose the first time.

539
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,610
But the second time wasn't on purpose either?

540
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,800
I saw everything. You did it on purpose.

541
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,920
Tell us. Why did you kick his watermelon?

542
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,640
Does your leg owe you something or did your foot itch?

543
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,690
You deserve to get pushed.

544
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,680
And you. I'm talking about you.

545
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,310
He kicked your watermelon so you push him?

546
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,400
You pushed him so hard. What would we do if he got injured?

547
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,530
- I-I'm sorry.
- Why are you apologizing to me?

548
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,460
You pushed him. Apologize to him.

549
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,850
I'm sorry. Did you get hurt?

550
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,850
Why are you apologizing to him?

551
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,220
You don't need to apologize for anything.

552
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,940
He's the one who provoked you.

553
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,290
Young man, I don't mean to scold you,

554
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,670
but look what you did to his watermelon.

555
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,410
You should be apologizing.

556
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,110
Do I really need to tell you this?

557
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,850
It's all right, it's all right. We've inconvenienced everyone.

558
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,710
- We've inconvenienced everyone.
- Yes.

559
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,000
Sorry. I see that you still have a few more—

560
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,720
Don't go overboard.

561
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,630
Go back.

562
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,940
Uncle, I'm really sorry.

563
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,750
My boyfriend and I had a fight, so he's not in a good mood.

564
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,080
Why's he taking his anger out on a watermelon?

565
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,210
Look at what he did to the watermelon.

566
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,700
Such great watermelons got ruined. What a pity.

567
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,850
How about this? I'll pay you for the watermelon.

568
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,830
This watermelon wasn't meant to be sold.

569
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,210
I carried it this far

570
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,480
for my son to eat.

571
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,090
Uncle, are you Ma Xiaolong's father?

572
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,520
You are...

573
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,320
I also work at Mantang Realty. I'm his colleague.

574
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,890
Is that really you? He showed me your picture before.

575
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,830
Did he really?

576
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,730
Here.

577
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,350
- Wipe your hands.
- Thank you. Thank you.

578
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,010
Look, I didn't intend to push him.

579
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,140
Please don't apologize. It's his problem.

580
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,720
Please take a seat.

581
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,770
You bumped into someone you know?

582
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,050
It really takes a fight to get to know each other. It's interesting.

583
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:28,700
What's going on?

584
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,480
Actually, I haven't seen Xiaolong for a couple of years now.

585
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,080
Luckily,

586
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,000
he is connected with a relative on social media.

587
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,760
My friend told me

588
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,130
he posted something on his social feed.

589
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,600
He said he misses the watermelon I grow,

590
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,320
and he cannot come home either,

591
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,940
so I thought I should bring him some watermelon.

592
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,170
Most importantly, I want to see him.

593
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,420
Is it so difficult for two living humans to meet?

594
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,360
You don't know the story.

595
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,160
It's all my fault that

596
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,520
we can't see each other.

597
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,960
Uncle, Xiaolong also wants to see you.

598
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,560
It's true.

599
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,480
Xiaolong told us all the time

600
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,870
that his father's watermelon is the sweetest.

601
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,830
He even said he wants to visit you during Chinese New Year.

602
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,330
That's great. Thank you so much for

603
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,920
taking care of Xiaolong at work.

604
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,160
When Xiaolong was younger,

605
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,550
he said when he grew up,

606
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,180
he wanted a job where he had to wear a suit.

607
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,770
He now has a job and he also has great colleagues.

608
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,230
I think my ancestors had sowed the seeds of good karma.

609
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,550
Since you are a colleague of Xiaolong,

610
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,690
let me treat you with a watermelon.

611
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,640
When he receives the watermelon, he has to share them with his coworkers anyways.

612
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,000
- That's too big.
- Even though the watermelon might be crushed in pieces,

613
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,120
the flesh is clean.

614
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,940
Thank you.

615
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,320
- Sir.
- I get some too?

616
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,860
Wait, let me start filming.

617
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,920
- Thank you so much.
- This watermelon is from the Northwest China desert.

618
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,320
It's very sweet. You can't get it anywhere else.

619
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,880
Let me have a slice too. Thanks.

620
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,270
It's really sweet.

621
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,480
No wonder Xiaolong misses it so much.

622
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,770
Miss, when are you getting off?

623
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,160
Let me pick one for you to take home.

624
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,920
No, no! Don't pick one.

625
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,610
It's wasteful to be on the floor,

626
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,860
- let's just finish it first.
- It's so sweet.

627
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,800
It tastes so good.

628
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,640
It's so nice.

629
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,940
Take another piece.

630
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,880
Dad, they are eating watermelon.

631
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
I want to eat watermelon too.

632
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,960
I...

633
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,400
Can you eat grapes for now? Your mom prepared some grapes for you.

634
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,780
I don't want it. I only want watermelon.

635
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,480
Be a good boy.

636
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,000
Grapes and watermelon are the same.

637
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,080
They both have seeds, they taste sweet and they have skin.

638
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,850
Eat some grapes.

639
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,220
I don't want it. Buy me a watermelon.

640
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,510
Why don't you drink some water?

641
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,380
No, I don't want water. I want watermelon.

642
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,320
If you don't want to drink then don't drink.

643
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,650
Miss, there are a few more pieces.

644
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,140
Let's share them among us.

645
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,760
How is it? Aren't they sweet?

646
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,200
Uncle, Xiaolong said he knew he made a mistake.

647
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,280
He shouldn't have avoided you.

648
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,710
He really loves you.

649
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,700
I'm not a celebrity, I'm just an ordinary person like you.

650
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,220
Last night, I was moved by everything you did.

651
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,590
There will always be more happiness than trouble. If you want to be happy, come find your Brother Yi.

652
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,410
If you don't leave me, I will accompany you until you die.

653
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,610
What you just said,

654
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,840
I was so moved by your word.

655
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,880
I saw that uncle was too pitiful.

656
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,060
He was so anxious and upset.

657
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,800
I just mentioned his son.

658
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,740
I didn't think and I didn't stop.

659
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,080
If I could comfort him at his last moment,

660
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,520
I think I did a good deed.

661
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,400
Only two people left.

662
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,720
Those two got on the bus at the same stop.

663
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,620
''My Only'' - Zhou Shen

664
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,130
♫  You are the only  ♫

665
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:12,650
♫  The only one who heals me  ♫

666
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:18,150
♫  When I look into your eyes  ♫

667
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:26,260
♫  I heard my heart beat  ♫

668
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:33,830
♫  You are my only  ♫

669
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:43,290
♫  Always believed in me  ♫

670
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:48,510
♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

671
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,270
♫  I'll be strong with you by me  ♫

672
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:58,540
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

673
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,090
♫  You are my only  ♫

674
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,330
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

675
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,940
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

676
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,280
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

677
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,870
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

678
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:36,420
♫  You are my only  ♫

679
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:44,170
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

680
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,900
♫  I will never leave  ♫

681
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,490
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

682
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:02,530
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

683
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,130
♫  To me  ♫
