00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,960
Today, 1:43 in the afternoon,

4
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,840
Bus 45 was going

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,950
between the intersection of Yanjiang East Road and Qiu Shi Road,

6
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,140
and it collided with an oil tanker, resulting in an explosion.

7
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,760
The initial conclusion of the explosion

8
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,990
was the collision of the bus and the oil tanker,

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,960
which resulted in an oil explosion.

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,550
However, on the bus, the investigation team

11
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,130
found signs of bomb residue.

12
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,570
We highly suspect that this explosion was man-made.

13
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,940
So we've set up an emergency task force.

14
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,290
I am the team leader of the task force. Old Du will be responsible for specific work on this team.

15
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,010
To avoid panic in the community,

16
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,140
while we look for any suspects,

17
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,870
we must not leak any information.

18
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,700
We must alert the relevant departments as soon as possible

19
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,100
to secure safety.

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,070
Can the surveillance on the bus be confirmed to be completely destroyed?

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,840
The technical department has tried their best to retrieve it, but they couldn't.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,680
And, the company's maintenance checklist showed

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,220
that Bus 45 was running normally

24
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,420
when it left the bus stop.

25
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,560
How is the investigation going for the passengers that passed away?

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,100
All the passengers have been identified.

27
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,660
Next, we need to investigate in two directions,

28
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,740
one is to find the social background of all the passengers,

29
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,720
and see if there are any motives against the people on the bus.

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,590
Apart from the passengers that were killed, the other direction we can search is

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,850
all the passengers of Bus 45

32
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,010
that came on and off the bus, starting from the bus stop.

33
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,880
We must find them and see if there are any clues.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,580
All right, gather all the clues,

35
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,080
and solve the case soon.

Help me hold her.

47
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,600
Don't you have asthma? Why are you still raising cats?

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,240
I like raising cats. I've loved cats since I was young.

49
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,440
But, my mom has always forbidden me from raising them.

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,480
When I was younger, I secretly raised one

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,760
and she secretly gave it away. I cried a lot because of it.

52
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,070
So, when I got old enough to work and earned my own money, I rented this place

53
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,200
and adopted them. Every day after work,

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,850
I'll feed them and then I'll go home.

55
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,690
My parents still don't know about this place.

56
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,280
- How can they...
- There's a cat fur cleaner over there.

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,860
Every day, before I go home...

58
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,950
how did you know that I have asthma?

59
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,070
No, can you tell me what happened?

60
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,720
Why don't we tell him? What if he actually entered the time loop?

61
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,550
Time loop?

62
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,390

63
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,290
Say it.

64
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,310
It is like this.

65
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,330
We pulled you off the bus today because we wanted to steal your bag,

66
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,240
not because we lost our bag.

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,160
We wanted to check what you had in your bag.

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,070
If I told you, you may not have believed it, but we already checked you twice before.

69
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,210
For the first time, you fought with each other.

70
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,520
We didn't even open your bag, the bus exploded.

71
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,320
The second time, you had an asthma attack.

72
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,380
When we got you off the bus, it exploded.

73
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,530
So the third time, we decided to stop you before getting on the bus.

74
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,110
It's the way you were protecting your bag that made you suspicious.

75
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,350
So we thought that you had a bomb in your bag.

76
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,100
It's like this. We also don't know how we got into the time loop.

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,940
During the loop, we found out that the bus will explode.

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,700
The suspect is on the bus and we need to figure out the suspect one by one.

Do time loops only happen in August?

No. Time loops usually happen in the summer in an anime.

For example, "Summer Wars",

Once you flip the eight horizontally, it's the infinity symbol.

you both are good-looking.

Should we think about who to check next?

136
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,750
I have a question.

I didn't get on the bus today.

I don't know who is on the bus either.

139

Let's draw it for him.

140

Here's the entrance of the bus.

Once you enter the bus, there's a muscular man on your left-hand side.

After that, there's a live streaming host wearing a bright-colored shirt.

The two of them don't have a suitcase,

145
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,210
besides, this person also has a good sense of justice and has a very positive energy.

146
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,640
So, I'd say we can eliminate the two of them.

147
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,160
Then, there's an old man sitting on this side.

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,240
I don't know what's wrapped up in his bag.

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,350
There was a hole in the bag, it should be a watermelon.

150
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,000
Then there was an old auntie sitting here.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,980
There was a red bag under her feet.

152
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,410
We don't know what this could be.

153
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,050
And here, there is an old woman.

154
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,920
Inside her bag, there's only medicine.

155
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,050
Another man was sitting here.

156
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,670
That man brought a suitcase with him.

157
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,020
Wait a second.

158

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,410
That can't be, that can't be.

160
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,190
From this place, even if they were going to the airport or the train station,

161
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,760
there is another bus that goes straight there.

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,330
He doesn't necessarily need to ride Bus 45.

163
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,920
He would need to change buses in between.

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,940
Could it be that in his suitcase...

165
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,140
How come you're so familiar with the public transportation routes?

166
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,510
Of course, I'm from Jialin.

167
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,980
But even if he took a suitcase with him,

168
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,500
it doesn't necessarily mean that he's going to the airport or the train station.

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,790
Excuse me.

170
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,310
Hello, Mom?

171
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,590
I'm off work. I'll come back right away.

172
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,870
No, why are you waiting for me? Eat first, don't wait for me.

173
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,430
Okay, I got it. I'll go home right away.

174
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,970
Bye-bye.

175
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,730
I'm sorry, I need to go home now.

176
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,040
My mom urges me to come home.

177
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,700
I haven't fed them yet, I need to hurry and feed them.

178
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,950
I have a question.

179
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,630
How was my cat doing

180
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,990
in the loops when I died?

181
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,640
When I wake up tomorrow,

182
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,910
it'll either be my normal everyday life or I'll enter the loop.

183
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,060
But if I'm in the next loop and still

184
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,490
die...

185
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,860
Forget it. I still need to go back home first, otherwise, my mother will be enraged.

186
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,700
What is it?

187
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,680
It's too strange.

188
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,230
They usually aren't like this.

189
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,450
They are usually cold and indifferent to me. How come

190
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,490
they are so clingy today?

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,350
Tell me, do they know that tomorrow I won't be in this world anymore?

192
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,740
Isn't it even more reasonable that you will enter the loop, then?

193
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,230
That's right.

194
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,650
I will head back home then. Where are you going?

195
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,040
If you really don't have a place to go,

196
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,020
I'll let the two of you stay in my secret base for a night.

Thank you.

199
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,090
But it actually doesn't matter where we go.

200
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,080
Actually, even if I haven't entered the loop, I can still help you.

201
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,620
As long as you summon me,

202
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,650
I will trust you.

203
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,090
Okay.

204

During that time, if I tell you

205
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,960
that I know that there's a cat inside your bag and that I know where your secret base is,

206
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,680
and that there are a lot of cats inside your secret base,

207
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,470
will you believe it?

208

I will.

209

By the way,

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,370
actually, you can address me by my name.

211
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,250
I will immediately believe you then.

212

What is your name?

213
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600

Wait. Who can remember such a long name?

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
Don't you think he's quite cute?

221

Is that cute?

222

In any case, he's probably the only person in this world that will believe us at this moment.

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,920
- Then we will come with you.
- There's no need.

328
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,390
- No way! We must come!
- Calm down!

329
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,000
You don't have to go. If only I go, it's enough.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,280
- No!
- He only has to cooperate with the police and will soon be back.

331
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,130
No one has to come with me. I can go by myself.

332
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,730
Son, let me drive you.

333
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,490
On the way there, think about what you did recently.

334
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,040
Why would the police be looking for you?

335
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,000
I will take my headphones.

336
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,690
Calm down, calm down.

337
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,300
Let's go!

338
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,710
Dad, Mom.

339
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,860
Today, I almost got on the bus that exploded.

340
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,510
I was just about to get on.

341
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,690
I was thinking,

342
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,010
if the God of Death laid his hands on me,

343
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,360
how would you keep me in your memories from now on?

344
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,750
An undisciplined son who wears weird clothes.

345
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,670
Who has no friends.

346
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,760
Who always complains to you.

347
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,410
He is a misfit in society,

348
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,700
and is also an asthma patient.

349
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,390
Compared to your coworkers' children,

350
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,280
my heart is colorful and meaningful.

351
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,360
I have already found the meaning of life.

352
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,670
I will protect and devote my heart to the 2D world.
(T/N: two dimensions = anime)

353
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,910
My only regret

354
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,520
is that no one will reward me with a medal.

355
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,550
I cannot hang them on the living room wall

356
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,940
and allow you to show off my achievement.

357
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,420
If one day,

358
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,660
I can’t come home.

359
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,770
Please go to this address

The password is 666666.

362
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,970
Once you go inside, you'll know my secret.

363
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,070
Don't be disappointed in me.

364
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,020
You have to think of it this way.

365
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,300
I have already experienced the life that I wanted.

366
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,610
I once had happiness.

367
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,260
Thank you for protecting me.

368
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,620
I just wanted to say that I love you guys.

369
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,040
I'm very happy and grateful.

370
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm already very satisfied with my life.

371
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,410
Honestly, my biggest wish

372
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,110
is for you to see the world that I see.

373
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,640
It is so wonderful.

374
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,230
Oh right, today I made two new friends]

375
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,940
They are really cool.

376
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,560
Perhaps, in another parallel world,

377
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,390
we can battle together side by side,

378
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,100
and save all the passengers on the bus.

379
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,250
In this world, I will no longer be your burden.

380
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,390
I can finally become someone who you can be proud of.

381
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,960
Everyone will remember my name.

382
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,850
Lu. Cat Apostle.

"An accident-free and outstanding driver continuously for four years,

he, selflessly, returned a handbag

left by a passenger on the bus, which contained ¥30,000 in cash."

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,240
I frequently ride this driver's bus.

404
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,150
He's really nice.

405

He has also helped me before.

We have the chance to save the driver and everyone else on that bus.

408

That's right. We still have a chance.

409

We can do it.

410
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,900
Every day without being lively is a betrayal to life.

411
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,390
Life is like a mirror. If you smile, it'll smile. If you cry, it'll cry.

412

Brother Yi's voice is so contagious.

Why aren't you happy? You have to be happy, right?

414
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,550
My saying still goes: if you never betray others, you'll be dependent on life and death.

What's wrong?

There will always be more happiness than trouble. If you want to be happy, come find your Brother Yi.

-I'm still healthy.

Healthy travel that does not hurt the waist, the happy Brother Yi decided to take the bus.

As long as your heart is beautiful, everyone else will also be happy.

422

How did that saying go? Life is like a mirror.

You say, is there really something wrong with that old man?

426
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,630
He doesn't look like the type to blow up a bus.

427
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,340
Think about how we saw Lu Di before.

428
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,570
Wearing a mask and hat,

429
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,400
he looked like a dangerous person. However, we were wrong.

430
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,360
So, judging people simply based on their appearance is inaccurate.

431

- Is it the police?
- I think so. I remember this number.

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,450
and disputed with a passenger named Lu Di?

That's right, but that was a misunderstanding. We've already explained it to him.

439

We also want to know,

440
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,550

We are conducting an investigation

They definitely found explosives on the bus. Otherwise, it wouldn't be as urgent.

They won't suspect us again, right?

450

I don't think they will. If they did suspect us,

451
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,360
they wouldn't have called us. They would have gone to find us directly.

It's okay. Didn't you tell me earlier to look at the problem positively?

465

If we go to the police station, we might be able to collect some valuable information.

We don't even know how to deal with the police, so he...

474

With that temper of his, he'll tell them about the loop.

486
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,260
If it's okay, can you go outside and tell him

487
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,900
to go home first? I can get back on my own.

488
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,400
Poor parents.

489
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,640
Your father insisted on waiting to go back home with you.

490
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,060
How's the questioning going?

491
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,570
I've cleared everything up. The other two passengers mistook Lu Di for carrying their bag.

492
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,190
Because a few days ago, they lost their bag on the bus.

493
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:03,420
They went up to check on the bag and then left.

494
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,970
Listening to his description, they don't know each other.

495
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,160
When they separated, they didn't leave any forms of communication.

496
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,000
Young man, not bad. Broad-minded.

497
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,590
Actually, back then I was pretty angry.

498
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,730
There's something that you guys don't know.

499
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,320
I lost my cat. They were trying to help me find my cat.

500
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,320
When the girl hugged the cat, she was super gentle. I could tell she was a cat lover.

501
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,890
Between cat lovers, all misunderstandings can be cleared.

502
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,600
I'll ask the other two later. If everything matches up, then they can go home.

503
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Understood.

504
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,930
Both of them came here?

505
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,780
That's right.

506
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,810
Sit here for a while.

507
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,010
Master, what questions do you have?

508
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,040
The relationship between those three is not that simple.

509
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,080
Lu Di didn't get on the bus, so he doesn't understand the situation.

510
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,330
Ask about what the other two encountered on the bus.

511
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,830
Understood.

512
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,510
Let's go.

513
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,980
''My Only'' - Zhou Shen

514
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,100
♫  You are the only  ♫

515
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:53,970
♫  The only one who heals me  ♫

516
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,100
♫  When I look into your eyes  ♫

517
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:07,440
♫  I heard my heart beat  ♫

518
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,030
♫  You are my only  ♫

519
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:24,550
♫  Always believed in me  ♫

520
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,820
♫  I will never be that weak-willed me  ♫

521
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,670
♫  I'll be strong with you by me  ♫

522
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:39,770
♫  How can I let you go away  ♫

523
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:46,110
♫  You are my only  ♫

524
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,190
♫  Always on my mind  ♫

525
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:00,270
♫  But it's so hard to find out why  ♫

526
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,580
♫  Dreaming of you every night  ♫

527
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:10,180
♫  I wonder why you never know  ♫

528
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:17,770
♫  You are my only  ♫

529
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:25,520
♫  Always be there waiting for me  ♫

530
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,190
♫  I will never leave  ♫

531
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,830
♫  I will be right there for you  ♫

532
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:43,700
♫  It seems like the real meaning  ♫

533
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,740
♫  To me  ♫
