Xiao Heyun, now you've killed someone and set the others on fire?

34
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,170
I couldn't believe it until the police showed me the pictures. What's going on?

35
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,760
I cannot explain it in just a few words.

36
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,120
The police told me to inform them once I'm in contact with you.

37
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,320
- You need to turn yourself in.
- I only need to talk to you for a moment.

I'm here because I want you to delete all references to me from the game.

Xiao Heyun, can you not be so selfish?

44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,900
Is the company yours? Why do I have to delete it because you told me to?

45

Can you please not go crazy when you want to? Can you?

46
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,100
I was wrong to answer violence with violence.

I apologize. I'm sorry.

You're sorry. Sorry?

50
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,270
We told you to change the game when it was rejected because it was bloody and violent, but you didn't.

You all are very important to me,

I felt exhausted.

Did you turn yourself in?

Let everyone off the bus.

Ask everyone to get off at the Yanjiang East stop, this is our only opportunity.

But this woman is too alert.

143
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,680
If we approach them verbally one by one, it's too risky.

144
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,740
- Let's type it out for them to see.
- Great idea.

How about the driver?

148
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,340
If everybody gets off the bus, what about the driver?

149
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,520
Wait until everybody is off, the driver and I will be the last to leave.

150
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,560
No.

151
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,750
That's too obvious. She will detonate it right away.

152
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,690
But this is the best way to reduce the causalities.

153
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,930
The question is whether we want to save the driver and

sacrifice the rest of the passengers.

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,560
like oil, rice, or noodles.

164
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,810
- Sure.
- Thanks.

165
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,030
Okay.

166
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,190
Hello, Auntie. We are university students working on a start-up.

167
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,280
Uncle, we have an offline event at the next stop.

168
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,580
Take a look.

169
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,680
If you participate, you will get free gifts.

170
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
This is a charity event.

171
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,850
It is near Yanjiang East Road bus stop, it won't take too much of your time.

172
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,250
Okay. Thank you.

173
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,100
Hi Auntie, we are university students and we have an event at Yanjiang East Road.

174
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,930
If you attend the event, you will have free gifts. Are you willing to attend?

175
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,830
These are our photos.

176
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,190
You are on the same team, right?

177
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,020
Bro, are you filming a video?

178
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,590
I have been observing you for a while, where are the hidden cameras?

179
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,460
But your topic is quite evil.

180
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,480
How many times have you done this? On which platform?

181
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,980
First time.

182
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,860
I think we can work together. I also make videos.

183
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,310
Really?

184
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,120
We have an event at the next stop, do you want to join us?

185
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,610
I can't, I have an appointment. I have a fan-meet event.

186
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,260
Hello. We are university students,

187
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,130
we have an event near Yanjiang East Road bus stop, please take a look

188
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,080
It won't take much of your time.

189
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Can you participate?

190
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,530
Driver, this is the Yanjiang East Road stop.

191
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,400
Don't block the entrance.

192
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,750
We have arrived at Yanjiang East Road. Please get off from the back door.

193
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,320
Bro, you need to get off at the back door.

194
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,170
Got it!

195
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,470
- We have an event...
- What are you doing?

196
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,700
What event? I need to get on the bus.

197
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,050
Why are you not allowing me to get on?

198
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,390
We couldn't get everyone off the bus.

199
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,880
This woman wants everyone to die together.

200
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,910
Once she senses something unusual, she'll immediately detonate the bomb.

201
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,950
At least we have proved an important fact.

202
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,220
If we use a text and pretend to be cops, people will believe in us.

203
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,400
But these passengers are totally out of control.

204
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Especially that Brother Yi, he keeps speaking nonsense.

205
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,270
We will simply avoid him. We want everyone

206
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,980
getting off the bus,

207
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,550
because she has a knife and we can't handle her.

208
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,820
If we manage to make everyone believe we are the police,

209
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,750
can't we ask them to give us a hand and restrain her together?

210
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,720
What's wrong?

211
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,780
I'm fine.

212
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,420
If we can have two people restrain her when we arrive at Yanjing East Road stop.

213
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,500
Then you can go and grab the pot, and remove it from the bus.

214
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,020
In the past, I remember

215
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,060
when we first confronted her,

216
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,340
that guy over there helped us, didn't he?

217
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right. The last time I grabbed the knife, he was the only person who wanted to stop me.

218
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,620
Perhaps he is the one who can come forward.

219
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,090
- I'm going to ask.
- Wait a minute.

220
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,540
We can't do this. I can't take the pot off the bus.

221
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,830
There are too many pedestrians at Yanjiang East Road stop.

222
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,860
Even if I removed the pot,

223
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,530
in such a short period of time, I can't evacuate all the people around.

224
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,090
What if the ringtone rings at that moment, the damage will be bigger.

225
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,190
How about this.

226
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,950
We wait until the bus gets on the bridge, then I will go and grab the pot.

227
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,400
Then I will throw the pot into the river.

228
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,350
This should be the safest option.

229
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,560
Meaning you will need to convince the bus driver to stop,

230
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,110
then you grab the pot. What if you can't make it?

231
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,720
If that's the case, we still need someone to help.

232
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,120
Help?

233
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,970
We have a helper.

234
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,110
[Passengers, the next stop is Yanjiang East Road]

235
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,980
[I'm a police. When you see this text, stay calm. There is a bomb on the bus, it's right beneath that woman in the gray shirt. She has a knife, I need your help to restraint her. Someone will remove the bomb. Nod if you understand.]

236
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,960
Young man,

237
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,420
will you consider me a good samaritan,

238
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,910
if I help you?

239
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,550
Yes.

240
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,650
We are approaching Yanjiang East Road stop. Please get off using the back door.

241
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,700
Please swipe your card when you leave. Passengers near the doors, please pay attention to your safety.

242
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,260
What’s going on?

243
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,490
Are you okay?

244
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,300
Lu. Cat Apostle, Asthma Conqueror, A person chosen by the light.

245
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,920
Di.

246
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,210
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated.

247
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,580
What are you doing?

248
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,960
The next stop is Yanjiang West Road.

249
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,560
[There is a bomb on the bus, it's right beneath that woman in the gray shirt. She has a knife, I need your help to restraint her. Someone will remove the bomb. Nod if you understand.]

250
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,650
Who are you? What are you trying to do?

251
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm a police officer. I need your help.

252
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,560
Do you have any credentials?

253
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,570
You have a cat in your bag. You can’t have cats because of your asthma, but you keep five cats anyways.

254
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,690
You rented a space at Animation City without your parent's knowing.

255
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,910
Your passcode is 666666.

256
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,030
We have already secured all your information. I'm a police officer.

257
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,080
You are definitely not a police officer.

258
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,630
Cat Apostle, Asthma Conqueror, A person chosen by the light.

259
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,550
They are correct, why don't you believe me?

260
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,660
But I don't care anymore.

261
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,920
Because you called my name

262
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,730
and you also know my secrets.

263
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,740
I'm willing to cooperate with you.

264
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,490
Tell me, what should we do?

265
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,830
Uncle, I have something to tell you.

266
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,320
There is a crazy woman on the bus.

267
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,550
Don't look at me. Keep your eyes on the road.

268
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,140
I know you are in shock, but I'm telling you the truth.

269
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,250
That woman near the back door.

270
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,420
She has a bomb, it is inside the plastic bag right underneath her legs.

271
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,590
Don't look back, she is very dangerous.

272
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,420
She is very alert and she will find out.

273
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,990
What do you want me to do?

274
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,870
Don't be afraid.

275
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,460
A police officer will restrain that crazy woman.

276
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,170
Once we get on the bridge, they will take action.

277
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,430
At that moment, you just need to pull over,

278
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,090
they will throw the bomb off the bridge.

279
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,070
How do you know?

280
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,650
The police already notified everyone on the bus.

281
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,560
They wanted me to notify you discreetly.

282
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,600
I'm telling you the truth.

283
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,770
The force of the bomb is very powerful. We can only throw it into the river.

284
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,750
You must pull over and open the doors. It's the only way for us to survive.

285
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,370
We will be on the bridge shortly.

286
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,550
Don't panic, just follow my instructions.

287
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,720
Do you understand?

288
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,240
Let me go. What are you trying to do?

289
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,870
Let me go.

290
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,770
What's going on?

291
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,690
What's the situation?

292
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,130
Stop fighting.

293
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,040
Release your hands. What's going on?

294
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Everyone, don't panic. They are police officers.

295
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,510
That woman has a knife and she has the intention to kill.

296
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,610
- Take a seat.
- What's going on?

297
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,680
Let go of me!

298
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,480
You crazy punk!

299
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,070
They are all murderers!

300
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,370
Let me go!

301
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,680
Sir, it's almost time.

302
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,600
Please pull over there and let us go.

303
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,240
Just pull over and open the door, Sir!

304
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,260
Wang Xingde!

305
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,880
What are you doing?

306
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,100
What are you doing?

307
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,240
Did you call the police?

308
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,990
You are a coward!

309
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,440
You are afraid to die.

310
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
You are a coward!

311
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,210
You do not deserve to be a man!

312
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,340
I didn't call the police.

313
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,200
- We are running out of time.
- Sir.

314
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,120
Sir! Stop the bus, there's no time left, Sir!

315
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,240
Stop the bus!

316
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,160
Stop the bus! Didn't you say you were going to

317
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,400
stop the bus?

318
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,050
Open the door.

319
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,970
Sir, open the door.

320
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,970
Sir, open the door.

321
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,290
Sir, open the door!

322
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,170
Open the door!

323
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,970
Open the door!

324
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,340
- Sir!
- He's not going to open the door.

325
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,680
We are running out of time. Help me!

326
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,150
Quick! Press her down.

327
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,040
Quick!

328
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,290
I'm sorry. Sorry.

329
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,480
Sir, there's a thief on this bus. My wallet has been stolen.

330
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,950
Are you sure you lost it here?

331
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,960
I'm sure I lost it on the bus. I even swiped my card when I got on.

332
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,330
Then I put it back into my bag and now it's gone.

333
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,560
My examination ID is in my wallet, and I have an exam today.

334
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,800
Driver, why aren't you opening the door?

335
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,520
All passengers.

336
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,220
This young lady's wallet has been stolen.

337
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,110
Her examination ID is in the wallet.

338
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,140
Whoever took the wallet

339
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,830
leave it on the floor now.

340
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,120
We won't take any action against you.

341
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,920
If no one wants to admit it then I'm going to call the police right now.

342
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,110
There are surveillance cameras on this bus, you can't get away.

343
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,350
I hope everyone can cooperate and understand the situation.

344
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,430
Hurry up and take it out now.

345
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,950
There is an examination ID in there, it's a big deal for the girl.

346
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,120
That's right. Whoever took it, give it back.

347
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,900
Give it back to her quickly, so annoying.

348
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,970
Exactly, if someone took it, take it out now, everyone is waiting.

349
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,180
How about this? Everyone look out to the window,

350
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,250
don't peek and give him a chance.

351
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,580
Okay. Let's cooperate.

352
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,940
Isn't this the wallet?

353
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,850
Excuse me.

354
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,770
Is this one?

355
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,240
- That's right.
- Take a look.

356
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,310
It's here.

357
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,070
Thank you everyone.

358
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,140
Let me remind you all.

359
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,170
Don't steal on my bus.

360
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,200
I won't tolerate it.

361
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,480
Driver, we found the wallet, can you open the door now?

362
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,730
I'm in a hurry!

363
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,510
Hold on.

364
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,890
Thank you, everything was inside.

365
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,250
Can you make it to the exam on time?

366
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,150
Yes.

367
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,130
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated.

368
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:59,390
Take a seat at the back.

369
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,480
It's fine if I stand here.

370
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,300
It's you?

371
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,840
Don't stand there if there are empty seats.

372
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,860
You still remember me?

373
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,820
Sir, I want to thank you for helping me find my wallet last time.

374
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,820
I wanted to give you a small gift as a token of appreciation.

375
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,340
No need.

376
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,460
Take a seat.

377
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,180
I just wanted to...

378
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
Thank you.

379
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,990
No need.

380
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,290
Actually, it's me who should be thanking you.

381
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,990
Really. Without that examination ID, my semester would be over.

382
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,850
Miss.

383
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,360
- Are you studying at Jialin College?
- Yes.

384
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
My daughter goes there as well.

385
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,370
Your daughter is studying there?

386
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,300
Which year is she in? Which major?

387
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,380
She is working already.

388
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,710
What a coincidence.

389
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,990
Go back and sit down.

390
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,830
Do you want to get off the bus?

391
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,180
I would have never thought it would be you.

392
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,980
Why?

393
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,940
Why are you doing this?

394
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,660
I'm asking you a question. Why?

395
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,500
Can you stop chatting with the driver?

396
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,710
Shut up.

397
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,070
Which one is the real you?

398
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,750
You're not this type of person.

399
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,160
Do you have any excuses?

400
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,900
Are you being threatened by someone?

401
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,730
Did that lady force you?

402
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,820
I don't understand why you need to perform such an evil act?

403
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,980
- I just want to know.
- Who are you?

404
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,080
Wang Xingde.

405
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,600
Who is she? What is she talking about?

406
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,380
What did you do?

407
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,420
What did you do?

408
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,030
Wang Xingde.

409
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,160
Answer me!

410
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,690
- What's going on?
- Sir.

411
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,650
I trusted you so much.

412
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,240
I even wanted to save you, but now you want to

413
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,450
kill everyone on the bus? Why?

414
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,920
Say something!

415
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,810
Who are you?

416
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,190
[Bus 45 Terminal - Xueye South Road]

417
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,810
We have arrived at Gangwu New Village. Please get off using the back door.

418
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,990
Please swipe your card when you leave. Passengers near the doors, please pay attention to your safety.

419
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,430
Sir, do you have any spare change?

420
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,880
Sir?

421
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,820
Spare change?

422
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,060
Thank you.

423
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,840
Driver, if they aren't here, let them take the next bus.

424
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,800
Can we leave first?

425
