Let's sort this out ourselves first.

[Pedestrian Bridge, Intersection, Bridge]

7
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,310
There have been ten loops so far.

8
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,120
This is your 10th loop and my 5th loop.

9
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,540
We woke up at 1:36 pm.

10
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,150
I checked the time when the bomb exploded, it was 1:42 pm.

11
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,270
The location of the explosion is at the intersection.

12
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,140
The reason for the explosion was a car accident. The oil tank exploded.

13
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,120
We woke up at 1:37 pm during the 9th loop.

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,420
The time of the explosion was...

15
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,800
We aren't sure about that.

16
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,600
The location of the explosion was on the bridge.

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,840
The reason for the explosion was someone purposefully setting off a bomb.

18
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,670
The 8th loop...

19
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,990
In the 8th loop, I tried to break open the window with a hammer and then I was pushed to the ground.

20
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,660
I don't really remember the time we woke up.

21
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,710
We don't know when it exploded either.

22
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,130
The location was still at the intersection.

23
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,470
The reason for the explosion was also the car accident.

24
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,450
The 7th time I woke up was at 1:39 pm.

25
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,390
The time of explosion... I still didn't check.

26
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,460
The location was still at the intersection. The reason for the explosion was also the car accident.

27
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,080
The 6th time I woke up was...

28
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,200
The time of the explosion in the 6th loop was at 1:42 pm.

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,190
Okay. 1:42 pm.

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,170
So it seems like the time of explosion for the 6th and 10th time are the same.

31
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,760
[Explosion]

32
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,100
Then there is a great possibility that this is the time when the car accident happened at the intersection.

33
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,410
Also, look at this pattern. We seem to wake up a minute earlier each time.

34
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,490
So this would mean we woke up the 8th time at...

35
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,980
1:38 pm.

36
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,040
The 6th time would be at 1:40 pm.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,640
If the time corresponds to the route traveled...

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,560
I think that each time I wake up, I indeed would see that the scenery outside the window

39
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,870
would be different each time.

40
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,390
And the 5th time.

41
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,110
The 5th time was the first time I encountered the car accident,

42
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,840
which also took place at the intersection.

43
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,640
That time it was because I pretended to be sick,

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,180
so the driver decreased his speed and met a red light.

45
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,670
Intersection and it still exploded at 1:42 pm.

46
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,230
So deducing from this, you probably woke up at 1:41 pm.

47
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,020
So this would mean that

48
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,320
the time we wake up is really getting earlier.

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,200
But what does waking up earlier each time mean?

51

Bring people to enter from the east entrance. Pay attention to your surroundings. Keep in contact at all times.

52
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,530
The first loop was after I left the university and boarded the bus at the stop near the campus.

53
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,500
Campus.

54
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,370
I boarded the bus at Gaoxin District, which is the stop before yours.

55
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,910
Then when did you wake up?

56
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,440
It's okay. Then the time of explosion...

57
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,080
Then the place of explosion?

58
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,130
It could have been on the bridge.

59
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,620
On the bridge.

60
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm not certain because...

61
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,570
because everything happened all too fast.

62
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,630
I was in a half-asleep half-awake mode. I only remembered that ringtone.

63
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,950
It's that...

64
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,580
During that time...

65
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,570
when I just opened my eyes, without being given any time to process what's happening, it just...

66
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,320
No, why are you throwing it away?

67
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,520
At this point, you shouldn't be hiding anything from me. But you're saying...

68
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,610
I'm not hiding anything! All that I'm saying is true!

69
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,570
I woke up only because I heard that ringtone.

70
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,740
Right when I opened my eyes and, without realizing what's going on,

71
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,860
it exploded.

72
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,320
I told you everything that I know.

73
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,420
Did you not believe me all this time?

74
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,810
I just don't want to be so passive.

75
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't let down your guard. This area is quite tricky.

76
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,340
Pay attention to your surroundings.

77
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,970
Then what should we do?

78
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,710
Shouldn't we be thinking right now

79
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,680
why I entered this loop, and why you also came in?

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,710
Just with the information we have at hand now, we can't figure that out.

81
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,310
But we should think of a way to break out of the loop, right?

82
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,920
The first time we exited the bus together,

83
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,760
that time I lived, and you died.

84
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,610
We didn't break out of the loop.

85
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,050
But this time we both survived,

86
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,570
do you think that we...

87
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm a game designer.

88
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,370
From a game's point of view,

89
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,890
the player must prevent the explosion and save all the people on the bus,

90
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,790
in order to successfully pass the level, and break out of the loop.

91
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,960
So you are a game designer.

92
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,570
No wonder.

93
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
That's right. I still don't know your name.

94
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,720
Xiao Heyun.

95
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Heyun from Liu Yuxi‘s poem “Autumn Song“. 
(T/N: the line after where Heyun's name comes from, has Shiqing's name as well)

96
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,610
- My name is...
- Li Shiqing.

97
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,680
You said it when you made the police report.

98
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,800
Actually, in the 6th loop,

99
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,600
I was interrogated by the police.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,610
They were really so perceptive,

101
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,670
so I'm worried that if we really go to the police station,

102
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,650
would they let us go so easily?

103
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,120
It's because they are so perceptive, we need to tell the truth.

104
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,650
Don't make things overcomplicated.

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,940
Is there not a way

106
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,140
to explain why we made the report in a manner that they can accept?

107
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,180
Think about it, if this time the loop is broken,

108
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,420
the police will definitely find out the truth about the bomb.

109
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,900
I mean it's not like we detonated a bomb, we know so for a fact.

110
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,480
Come with me.

111
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,760
No, why did you want to

112
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,270
lie to the police in the first place?

113
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,100
It's not that I want to lie to the police,

114
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,120
it's just because in the 6th loop, I...

You turned off your phone, no one could contact you. The investors have been waiting for almost an hour.

163
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,850
I had to beg them for forgiveness. I almost knelt in front of them.

164
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,450
Do you still want to make your game?

165
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,360
I have something going on. I'm going to hang up.

166
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,430
That person wasn't polite.

167
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,060
Yes, that's why my phone was off.

168
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,220
Would the girl, Li Shiqing, accompany you

169
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,560
to the meeting?

170
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,270
No, we just met each other on the bus.

171
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,770
Just met?

172
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,270
Yes.

How is the situation at the crime scene?

187
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,310
The scene was destroyed completely.

188
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,490
We are still doing search and rescue work. There is not much information right now,

189
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,820
but it seems that it will be hard to obtain the on-dash camera footage,

190
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,940
so they are our only source at the moment.

191
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,090
They don't have any criminal record.

192
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,370
How was it when you found these two?

193
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,650
Li Shiqing didn't answer our questions.

194
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,840
She seems questionable.

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,680
Xiao Heyun is nervous on the way here.

196
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,350
He said he just met the girl on the bus,

197
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,390
but whether from the security camera

198
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,230
or on the way here, their behavior

199
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,840
doesn't look like they just met.

200
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,630
Not only that, but also looks like lovers.

201
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,550
They even want to sit in the same police car.

203

This is what we found.

204
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,790
They threw it in the garbage can.

205
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,680
Let me see.

206
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,670
This afternoon, 1:38 pm,

207
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,060
the police received a phone call from you saying

208
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,870
there is a bomb on Bus 45.

209
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,990
Did you willingly make the phone call yourself?

210
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,620
Yes.

211
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,770
How did you know there is a bomb in the car?

212
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,210
Did you see anything suspicious?

213
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,270
Then

214
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,160
did you hear any suspicious conversations

215
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,520
or

216
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,190
smell anything suspicious?

217
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,680
All no.

218
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,670
But you just knew that there is a bomb in the car.

219
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,780
Li Shiqing.

220
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
No matter if you want to admit it or not,

221
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,550
you still have to say something.

222
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,310
Understand?

223
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,110
After knowing there is a bomb, you decided to get off the bus and call the police.

224
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,560
Why didn't you wait for the bus to stop, tell the driver,

225
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,650
and have him assist in getting the passengers off?

226
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,780
Li Shiqing.

227
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,130
You recognize this map, correct?

228
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,080
After calling the police, why were your phones turned off?

229
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,660
Because we needed time.

230
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,530
You didn't say that in the car.

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,700
Because we needed time so we didn't want to be bothered.

232
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,570
These two things have no conflict, do they?

233
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,900
What do you need time for?

234
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,980
We needed time to collect evidence,

235
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,830
because everything is too complicated.

236
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,770
What things?

237
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,630
This, how do I say it?

238
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:45,240
It's like metaphysical existence.

239
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,790
Have you read novels, like science fiction novels?

240
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,900
Tell me why you drew this map.

241
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,260
What do the time and numbers represent?

242
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,080
This afternoon 1:42 pm.

243
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,610
It's around 2 or 3 minutes after the time you got off the car.

244
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,760
The bus that you were on

245
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,190
collided with an oil tank at a crossroad.

246
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,420
No one survived on the bus

247
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,960
and everything that happened, the time and location,

248
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,970
are drawn on the map. Why?

249
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,120
Coincidence?

250
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,190
What is your connection to the accident?

251
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,540
Police Officer Jiang, I swear that I have nothing to do with the accident.

252
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,670
Let me say this, my mind is very clear at the moment

253
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,150
and I also know what I am saying,

254
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,560
but perhaps, what I am going to say doesn't seem like what a clear-headed person may say.

255
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,360
I also wouldn't be able to explain and show you the real situation,

256
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,550
but you have to believe

257
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,910
what I am going to say is the truth. It's the reality.

258
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,110
We will decide if we are going to believe you or not.

259
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,160
All you have to do now is corporate with us and tell us the truth.

260
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,480
- Do I need to repeat that?
- No, no.

261
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,170
Then I'm going to say it.

262
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,180
We

263
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,310
are in a time loop.

264
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,930
What does that mean?

265
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,210
We keep reliving today.

266
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,320
Li Shiqing has looped around ten times. For me, it's five times.

267
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,780
We've experienced the explosion before, but after it, we've revived.

268
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,100
We will be back on the bus.

269
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,510
We thought that the explosion would happen because of a car accident, like this time.

270
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,470
But we soon realized that even if we avoided the accident,

271
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,760
the explosion will still happen.

272
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,160
The bus has a bomb.

273
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,200
Xiao Heyun, so many people died. We don't have the time to waste it with you.

274
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,710
I'm not. We really are in a loop.

275
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,680
Those are all human lives!

276
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,030
So many lives on the line.

277
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,550
Think about it.

278
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,990
What does he do?

279
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,990
He designs games.

280
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,260
Chief Du, what do we do now?

281
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,440
Yezi, prepare a drug test.

282
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,160
Chief Du.

283
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,160
What do we do now?

284
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,740
Old Zhang is spoiling you.

285
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,940
He has been telling me something about looping. Chief Du, how can I not be anxious?

286
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,720
Li Shiqing,

287
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,370
I have been listening to your police call repeatedly.

288
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,340
I can tell your speech was in an urgent tone.

289
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,040
You were hoping the police can stop the explosion,

290
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,920
and you did not wish the explosion to happen.

291
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,700
I can feel

292
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,920
you have a heavy psychological burden. Please tell me,

293
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,930
what are you worrying about?

294
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,680
When we found you at Qing Shui Park,

295
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,960
I saw

296
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,610
you were very nervous. Why?

297
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,470
Captain Zhang, can I ask you a question?

298
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,440
Of course you can, go ahead.

299
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,300
After you received my call,

300
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,000
did you take it seriously? Did you send any police officers right away?

301
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,410
After we received your call, we decided to send police officers to the scene.

302
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,210
But for us, the time was too short.

303
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,630
How did you know that my surname is Zhang?

304
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,110
When we saw you at Qing Shui Park,

305
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,260
only Xiao Jiang showed you his credential.

306
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,040
Since the beginning,

307
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,070
I haven't introduced myself to you.

308
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,780
How do you know that my surname is Zhang?

309
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,160
Sit down!

310
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,990
Can I go out and get some fresh air?

311
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,980
- It's too stuffy here.
- Sure.

312
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,730
As soon as you tell us the truth.

313
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,660
I told you the truth.

314
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,220
How about this? Why don't you take this idea of looping

315
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,590
and check on my map.

316
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,090
The time I woke up and also the explosion...

317
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,440
Are you telling me about the loop again?

318
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,740
If I am the one who did this, why would I bother to call the police?

319
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,080
It doesn't make any sense.

320
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,750
Fine.

321
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,310
Then you tell me, how did you know that there was a bomb on the bus?

322
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,930
- I've told you—
- Don't tell me about looping.

323
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,170
Li Shiqing, can you tell me

324
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,870
how did you know my surname is Zhang?

325
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,290
You said it yourself.

326
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,500
When did I do that?

327
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,030
Once, when we were at the hospital.

328
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,710
There’s no need to sit up, no need.

329
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,460
So you are Li Shiqing?

330
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,490
I’m the captain of the city detective unit. My name is Zhang Cheng.

331
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,940
That time, I was hit by a motorcycle and got a concussion.

332
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,020
At the time, I threw up and you gave me water.

333
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,120
You wanted to use your right hand to open the cap,

334
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,100
- but you didn't have the strength.
- Here, drink some water.

335
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,220
Hospital? Which hospital?

336
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
When was that?

337
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,730
I don't recall seeing you at the hospital.

338
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,250
It is impossible for you to remember.

339
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,500
It's because we met each other inside the loop.

340
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,440
What are you talking about? Loop?

341
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,830
[Loop?]

342
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,170
I still have to explain.

343
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,730
When I was at the hospital, I already told you the truth,

344
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,250
but you guys didn't believe me.

345
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,330
And it's possible that I didn't think carefully then.

346
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,540
Only since Xiao Heyun joined me in the loop, I was clear of everything.

347
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,450
When we avoided the car accident, then we realized there was a bomb on the bus.

348
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,960
Never mind, you won't believe me.

349
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,590
Whether we believe you or not, it's up to us.

350
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,690
We will investigate and obtain evidence. As for you,

351
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,250
believing the police

352
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,980
and answering the questions honestly is your only way out.

353
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,140
Then I will tell you from the very beginning.

354
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,620
[Don't be impulsive anymore.]

355
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,700
[I haven't finished talking,]

356
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,650
[it exploded again.]

357
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,700
Anything else? How many times will be next?

358
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,790
It's the ninth time.

359
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,430
Okay. Let's begin.

360
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:28,380
When we woke up this time, we came to a consensus.

361
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,030
Since the bus must have an accident at the intersection,

362
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,070
then we just need to make sure the bus will pass

363
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,750
before or after the red light.

364
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,530
We did avoid the accident this time,

365
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,220
but we didn't expect that,

366
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,320
after the bus got on the bridge, it still exploded.

367
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,250
That means the car accident was an episode of the variable.

368
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,940
The bus explosion was an inevitable outcome.

369
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,880
That's why we decided to call the police immediately.

370
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,910
Does it make sense to you now?

371
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,730
The key of the question is whether or not this time the bus

372
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,820
had the car accident at the intersection

373
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,690
and caused the explosion, but the bomb was not ignited on the bridge.

374
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,950
If we assume there was a bomb on the bus,

375
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,430
can you find any trace of explosives?

376
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,860
If that's the case, it will prove what I've been telling you is true.

377
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,320
What do you mean by "if there was a bomb"?

378
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,630
You told me so many things resolutely, and now you are telling me "if"?

379
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,200
I said "if" because

380
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,190
I cannot be 100% sure that there was a bomb on the bus,

381
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,960
it's possible that it was on the bridge or shot from another location.

382
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,050
Of course, it's most likely that

383
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,640
it was still on the bus, the top of the bus,

384
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,410
or the bottom, or the interior. Have you checked them all?

385
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,520
No, what now? I didn't mention to loop to anybody.

386
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,390
Xiao Heyun,

387
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,530
is there anybody threatening you? It's okay, you can tell me.

388
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,460
Why are you having trouble telling us the truth?

389
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,250
I didn't have any trouble...

390
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,020
I said...

391
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,140
All right.

392
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,060
Okay, you can think carefully, all we have is time.

393
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,240
Take your time and think through it, then we will talk again.

394
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,710
Okay.
 [I have seen the evidence, it's the same as I said.]

395
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,720
What else can I think? I...

396
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,950
I told you all the truth, why aren't you believing in me?

397
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,220
That means the first time,

398
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,530
the second time, and the ninth time,

399
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,620
the bus was directly exploded,

400
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,020
correct?

401
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,950
Yes.

402
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,210
Then you told me you fell asleep the first two times, then

403
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,710
you woke up with a ringtone and you considered

404
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,080
that was an explosion of a bomb,

405
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,260
but not a car accident. Correct?

406
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,620
That's correct. Because there was this ringtone every time it exploded.

407
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,930
Can you confirm that the ringtone

408
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,650
was from a cell phone?

409
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,830
To be honest, I can't confirm,

410
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,890
but it sounded like an old-fashioned polyphonic ringtone.

411
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,360
You...

412
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,330
Do you remember the tune of the ringtone?

413
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,930
Is it possible that

414
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,960
the bomb was attached to a countdown clock with that ringtone?

415
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,020
It's also possible that the ringtone has nothing to do with the bomb.

416
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,430
It could be a coincidence that someone's phone was ringing.

417
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,790
Chief Du, the drug test is ready.

418
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,620
Take them to do the drug test.

419
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,550
A time loop.

420
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:58,040
How can they write such a ridiculous script and not only once?

421
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,030
Master, what kind of expression is that?

422
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,310
You are not believing in them, are you?

423
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,420
Then you tell me what their motive for lying is.

424
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,600
If the bomb has nothing to do with them,

425
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,730
then they don't need to come up with a comprehensive lie.

426
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,690
If the explosion is associated with them,

427
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,480
then I think that they wouldn't have called the police,

428
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,620
and act in front of our eyes.

429
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,420
- How were the interviews?
- Based on what I have so far,

430
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,450
those two have very simple social networks, they do not have any bad habits.

431
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,020
Are they in a romantic relationship?

432
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,060
We couldn't find anything. Police interviewed their classmates and colleagues,

433
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,090
both of them are currently single.

434
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,230
Also, they have no interactions before this incident.

435
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,400
They also have no money or emotional disputes.

436
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,180
Non-existing motives

437
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,490
and there were no conditions to commit a crime, but they got off the bus before the explosion.

438
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,070
Also, they even came up with a diagram of the incident.

439
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:07,400
Based on the diagram, it was a calculated operation.

440
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,030
The girl looks gentle and frail,

441
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,730
but she is very guarded.

442
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,660
How about this?

443
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,460
Later, you and Xiao Jiang swap the interviewee.

444
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,160
Got it.

445
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,050
Xiao Heyun, here.

446
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,500
Have a cup of coffee to refresh up.

447
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,170
Do you know the next phrase after "Leniency of those who confess?"

448
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,320
Can you just tell me if there is a bomb on the bus?

449
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,770
Remember,

450
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,270
the next phrase is "severity for those who resist."

451
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,760
Game designer.

452
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,360
You must be very busy with work.

453
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,340
You have come here for several hours.

454
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,120
Are you bored?

455
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,320
Let me tell you, if you don't cooperate with us

456
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,130
and make things clear, I won't let you leave.

457
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,620
No, we don't need to talk further.

458
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,600
Can you just tell me if there is a bomb on the bus?

459
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,640
If there is a bomb and you got off the bus early,

460
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,460
both of you will be the main suspects.

461
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,330
What did Li Shiqing say?

462
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,100
She knows more than me.

463
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,420
You can just ask her, whatever she says is real.

464
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,010
Young man,

465
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,490
we are continuously giving you chances.

466
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,700
Sometimes, it's better to tell us now

467
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,260
then when we find out later in the investigation.

468
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,750
They will be totally different in nature.

469
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,020
Do you understand what I mean?

470
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,870
That girl fully cooperated with us.

471
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,850
We never saw the bomb.

472
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,560
If the police ask us where the bomb was, what do we tell them?

473
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,550
- Just tell them the truth.
- Tell them

474
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,770
we are in a time loop?

475
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,490
They wouldn't believe us.

476
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,350
They were really too sharp,

477
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,450
so I’m worried that if we really go to the police station,

478
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,730
would they let us go so easily?

479
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,850
Is there not a way

480
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,080
to explain why we made the report in a manner that they can accept?

481
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,730
I don't know what she said.

482
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,290
Every word I said is true.

483
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,750
I have nothing to hide.

484
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,460
Even though you question me a hundred times, I will say the same thing. What's the use of wasting your time here?

485
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,640
Then both of us will be prepared for this kind of situation.

486
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,720
We could be asking you the same questions a hundred times.

487
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,700
I already told you earlier,

488
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,830
that diagram is the result of the loop.

489
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,810
It has the time we woke up, the explosion time, and the location.

490
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,850
And you can take a look again.

491
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,750
Then?

492
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,980
No- I- I told you how many times? I don't need to repeat myself.

493
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,350
Don't you have surveillance cameras?

494
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,180
Can't you simply check the surveillance cameras?

495
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,410
I already said whatever I needed to say.

496
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,870
If you don't believe me, there is nothing I can do.

497
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,290
You mean

498
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,720
she ordered you to make up this story?

499
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,880
That's not what I meant. I organized my own thoughts.

500
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,000
You organized it?

501
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,490
You mean she wants to deceive the police,

502
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:11,620
and then you helped find the loop as an excuse.

503
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,960
You both used this story to deceive the police.

504
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,450
Can I interpret it this way?

505
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,510
Li Shiqing.

506
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,920
I suggest you be honest.

507
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,120
Xiao Heyun has already testified against you.

508
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,650
He testified against me?

509
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,760
He testified me for what?

510
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,810
He said for this incident, he knew nothing about it.

511
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,110
Also based on the surveillance camera, it was you who dragged him out of the bus.

512
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,750
He said this diagram was written based on your description.

513
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,760
He only knows the location,

514
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,090
he doesn't know the process. It was you who told him the timeline.

515
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,100
Impossible.

516
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,290
We had gone through everything together.

517
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,220
Li Shiqing.

518
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,370
If you still refuse to tell us the truth of the incident,

519
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,390
we can only accept the testimony from Xiao Heyun.

520
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,780
You know you are unfavorable when it comes to sentencing.

521
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,930
That's why I want you to tell me the truth.

522
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,290
Who planned this incident?

523
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,230
What's the purpose?

524
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,240
I want to know it too.

525
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,360
Chief Du.

526
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,540
There are no problems with the examination.

527
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,000
Hello?

528
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,420
Understood.

529
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,060
This diagram was drawn by Xiao Heyun?

530
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,450
I want to hear it from you,

531
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,290
what role did he play in this car accident?

532
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,200
Xiao Heyun said

533
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,850
this is a car accident?

534
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,230
The situation has changed, suspend the interrogation room.

535
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,170
Officer Jiang, are you lying to me?

536
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,070
You should know by now

537
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,300
that this is not a simple car accident.

538
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,670
[You are on camera. Please observe your behavior.]

539
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,430
[No entry for non-investigative personnel]

540
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,210
Chief Du.

541
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,660
At the scene,

542
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,880
they found bomb residue.

543
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,510
There was indeed a bomb on the bus.

544
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,740
The nature of this case has now changed.

545
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,430
Officers from the city are coming, we can't report to them about the time loop.

546
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,670
- What should we do now?
- We will start the detainment process.

547
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,110
Xiao Heyun and Li Shiqing are key suspects.

548
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,930
Xiao Heyun is very emotional, he is not guarded.

549
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,350
We will intercept at him first.

550
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,700
Xiao Heyun, I'm the City of Jialin Public Security Bureau Chief.

551
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,700
We are considering you as the key suspect of the Bus 45 explosive case.

552
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,060
We will now detain you according to the law.

553
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,080
I didn't have any motive and I didn't perform any criminal acts.

554
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,920
Why are you detaining me when there's no evidence?

555
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,990
We have confirmed there was a bomb on the bus.

556
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,370
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated.

557
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,060
The next stop is Yanjiang West Road.

558
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,220
