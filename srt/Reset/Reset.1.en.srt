00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,990
Am I correct?

163
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Li Shiqing?

164
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,180
I...

165
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,780
I was on a bus.

166
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,370
But what you said...

167
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,710
I'm not too sure.

168
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,010
Not too sure?

169
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,390
How about we help you remember?

170
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,320
What did you plan to do today?

171
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,760
I was supposed to buy some books.

172
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
At what place?

173
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,410
At a joint bookstore in the city center.

174
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,330
Bus 45 goes there directly.

175
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,080
If you were going to the city center, why did you get off early?

176
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,780
Did you see something suspicious on the bus?

177
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,680
Did someone have a conflict with the bus driver?

178
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,350
Did you overhear any suspicious conversations?

179
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,110
Or see any suspicious person?

180
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,450
I... I think I might have fallen asleep.

181
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,680
- You fell asleep?
- You fell asleep then suddenly woke up to get off the bus?

182
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,380
And not at a bus stop, too?

183
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,610
No?

184
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,110
I... I really can't remember anything.

185
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,790
Hello, did you find anything?

186
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,130
Li Shiqing has no criminal background.

187
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,370
She has no clear motive either.

188
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,570
Her background is very simple. She is just a regular college student.

189
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,820
You may be grasping at straws.

190
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,000
You saw the footage too.

191
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,100
Before Li Shiqing got off, the bus was operating normally.

192
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,570
But after they got off, the bus drove significantly faster.

193
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,800
Especially at the traffic light of the accident.

194
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,310
The bus started driving right away. It's not logical.

195
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,360
The bus illegally stopped on the side of the road, causing a delay.

196
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,280
It made sense that the bus would drive faster to make up the time.

197
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,800
No. That and an unscheduled stop are two separate issues.

198
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,940
She is too suspicious.  Nothing she says matches up.

199
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,250
How is the scene investigation going?

200
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,390
I think I can remember something.

201
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,580
I probably wasn't feeling well,

202
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,790
that's why the bus driver let me off.

203
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,340
Where were you feeling unwell?

204
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,030
I think my heart.

205
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,650
Heart?

206
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,440
Do you have a medical history of heart problems?

207
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,220
No.

208
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,200
Did you find out the real cause of the accident?

209
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,500
We still have to wait for the complete report.

210
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,220
But what Captain Zhang meant is

211
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,050
that, until we have directions from our superior, don't act on our own.

212
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,550
I remember...

213
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,100
I was next to the driver. I wanted to get off.

214
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,850
There was this one person who asked me

215
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,570
if I needed an ambulance.

216
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,830
Who is the person that wanted to get you an ambulance?

217
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,560
I don't think I know that person.

218
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,820
Now you can remember someone wanting to get you an ambulance.

219
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,660
Then can you remember that person's gender or identifying features?

220
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,160
Sir, she's sweating all over. She doesn't look too well.

221
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,410
Do you want me to accompany you off the bus and get you an ambulance?

222
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,390
Why don't you let us off at the next stop?

223
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,290
It's a male.

224
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,950
I think he wanted to call an ambulance for me.

225
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,770
He asked the driver to stop

226
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,770
so he could wait for the ambulance with me.

227
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,530
So you got off to wait for an ambulance?

228
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,340
How did you hurt your head?

229
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,480
[Qing Shui Xiang]

230
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,680
Pervert! Someone's being a pervert!

231
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,560
I remember now.

232
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,720
I encountered a pervert.

233
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,830
I wanted to take him to the police station.

234
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,930
- A pervert?
- Right.

235
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,090
Now you are saying you encountered a pervert?

236
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,720
Li Shiqing, I need to remind you again.

237
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,460
I don't care if you have amnesia or not,

238
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,840
but you could be the last witness.

239
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,540
It's very important.

240
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,550
I hope you will cooperate with us.

241
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,340
Master.

242
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,070
Captain Zhang.

243
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,940
There's no need to sit up, no need.

244
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,480
So you are Li Shiqing?

245
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm the captain of the city detective unit.

246
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,780
My name is Zhang Cheng.

247
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,830
Don't be nervous. We will take it slow.

248
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,700
Continue.

249
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,030
Li Shiqing.

250
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,590
You said you got off the bus with the pervert.

251
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,990
Where is he now?

252
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,270
I don't know. I really can't remember this part.

253
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,600
I do not remember.

254
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,710
So you are sure you are changing the ambulance to a pervert?

255
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,520
Li Shiqing, if you are lying to hide something, the consequences will be severe.

256
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,770
I'm not hiding anything.

257
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm telling the truth.

258
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,860
I... my mind is a mess right now,

259
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,310
but I'm telling you everything I can remember. I'm not lying.

260
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,260
Li Shiqing, I'm reminding you

261
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,390
that you did get off the bus with a man,

262
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,180
but you didn't wait for an ambulance or go to the police station.

263
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,560
Miss, don't be nervous.

264
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,620
I have the camera footage

265
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,700
that might help you to recall something.

266
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,640
Here. Take a look.

267
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,470
Pervert! Bus driver!

268
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,420
Is there something wrong with you?

269
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,960
I killed him.

270
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,850
What did you say?

271
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,410
I...

272
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,770
Give her some water.

273
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,280
Here. Have a sip of water.

274
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Thanks.

275
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,060
Miss, what did you remember?

276
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,850
I remember everything now.

277
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,820
What did you remember?

278
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,250
All of it. Everything.

279
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,440
That's great. Tell us.

280
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,620
I... I don't know what to say.

281
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,530
What do you mean?

282
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,550
Do you think...

283
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,580
there's something that you cannot say?

284
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,640
Both of you, go outside for now.

285
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,400
Captain Zhang.

286
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,550
Miss, during these twenty years of being a police officer,

287
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,250
there isn't anything that I haven't experienced.

288
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,100
This might be a complicated situation for you.

289
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,580
I can also see that you're a little helpless.

290
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,260
But you must trust the police and not doubt our abilities.

291
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,590
I encountered a dream within a dream.

292
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,350
Hold on.

293
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,850
Can I voice record this?

294
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,190
It started out like this.

295
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,810
Teacher Wu!

296
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,270
Li Shiqing, don't you have classes in the afternoon?

297
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,490
- I'm going to buy some books.
- Go ahead.

298
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,950
- Be safe.
- Bye-bye.

299
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,960
I was waiting by the university's north gate bus stop.

300
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,840
It was Bus 45.

301
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,710
I often ride that bus,

302
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,250
so I was familiar with the bus driver.

303
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,090
Sir.

304
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,580
After I got on the bus, I saw there were a lot of people.

305
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,570
There were hardly any open seats left.

306
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,400
I just sat towards the back.

307
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,140
The vehicle is in motion, please be seated.

308
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,350
The next stop is Jiaming Community Hospital.

309
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,710
Whenever I get in a car, I tend to fall asleep.

310
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,160
So, I fell asleep quickly.

311
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,930
I don't know how long I slept.

312
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,640
I woke up dizzily

313
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,370
to a phone's ringtone.

314
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,880
It was like...

315
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
like an older phone model ringtone.

316
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,240
But strangely, the sound was very loud.

317
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,260
When I opened my eyes,

318
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,640
I felt

319
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,910
like some sort of

320
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,640
blinding light was shining on me.

321
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,310
In a split second, I felt my face

322
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,740
burning up and in pain.

323
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,330
And then?

324
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,450
And then...

325
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,870
And then I felt like I couldn't see anything.

326
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,660
I felt like I was floating.

327
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,120
I felt so light.

328
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,540
And then... and then it was the second time.

329
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,300
The second time I woke up, I found out

330
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,260
I was still on the bus.

331
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,650
In the beginning, I thought it might be just a dream.

332
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,710
However, I had a huge headache.

333
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,770
I thought I might have hit my head somewhere when I fell asleep,

334
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,010
so I took out my phone to check.

335
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,600
But there weren't any bruises on my head.

336
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,680
There wasn't anything red or a mark.

337
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,870
And then...

338
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,820
I looked out the window and felt the sun was super bright.

339
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,970
At that moment, I found out I was sleeping for a long time

340
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,450
because there was hardly anyone on the bus.

341
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,970
The boy beside me was still there.

342
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,170
He was also sleeping.

343
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,070
But during this time, the ringing began again.

344
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,140
I thought that something was odd.

345
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,420
If it's really a dream,

346
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,420
how could the ringing be the exact same?

347
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,860
I felt that it was quite weird.

348
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,090
At that time, the light came again,

349
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,520
but this time it felt even more realistic than last time.

350
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,360
And more clear.

351
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,700
I can clearly feel that it was an explosion.

352
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,870
The bus I was sitting on exploded.

353
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,530
[Ye Qian: I checked, the boy who sat beside her on the bus is named Xiao Heyun and is currently at Jialin Hospital.]

354
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,360
After two times,

355
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,560
I started to guess

356
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,680
that maybe something strange is happening to me.

357
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,780
So the third time,

358
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,980
- I woke up—
- Li Shiqing, please be serious.

359
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,800
Can you speak properly?

360
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,260
We've been here the entire afternoon.

361
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,390
Xiao Jiang, go check the situation downstairs.

362
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,910
Go.

363
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,390
Captain Zhang,

364
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,530
do you believe what I said?

365
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,970
Do you... do you still want me to continue?

366
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,390
You've already woken up three times.

367
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,430
Continue.

368
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,300
The third time, I recovered for a long time.

369
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,820
I recalled everything that happened,

370
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,110
it felt so real.

371
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,960
I felt like the entire situation felt so thrilling.

372
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,330
This wasn't a dream anymore.

373
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,640
But I realized after continuously experiencing an explosion,

374
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,350
my first reaction was to

375
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,420
get off the bus.

376
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,200
[Emergency Exit]

377
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,880
The fourth time I woke up,

378
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,430
I went to grab the emergency hammer.

379
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,360
But I didn't think that when I took off the hammer,

380
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,240
the entire bus would ring alarms.

381
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,180
And then the bus blew up.

382
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,310
So the fifth time, I completely gave up forcing my way off the bus.

383
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,930
I started thinking

384
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,280
of other ways.

385
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,310
I'm sorry, I...

386
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,770
I saw that you were sweating a lot.

387
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,840
I was wondering if you wanted to wipe it.

388
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,980
I'm sorry, I...

389
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,510
I... I didn't mean to.

390
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,400
I was just grabbing this tissue and then the USB...

391
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,090
Sir, I-I'm having a heart attack right now.

392
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,100
C-Can you take me to the hospital?

393
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,790
- What's going on?
- Is it serious?

394
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,700
I must immediately go to the hospital.

395
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,240
Please send me to the hospital, is that okay?

396
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,600
The closest hospital is Renhe Hospital.

397
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,920
There's a health station across the bridge!

398
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,710
Can you bear it?

399
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,590
Are you okay?

400
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,030
Just hold on for a little longer.

401
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,440
I can only watch

402
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,220
the time go by little by little.

403
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,620
I really didn't know what to do anymore.

404
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,920
But by this time, the bus was already at the crossroad.

405
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,320
I was hoping someone would come and help me,

406
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,250
but no one did. They all agreed to cross the bridge.

407
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,380
Only that boy.

408
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,350
The boy I dragged off the bus.

409
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,270
Sir, she's sweating a lot.

410
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,440
Do you want me to get off with you and call the ambulance?

411
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,080
Her situation is really serious. It'll be bad if we get stuck up front.

412
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,200
I have medicine here.

413
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,010
Don't be scared. I have all the medicine here.

414
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,320
Young man, let me through.

415
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,890
- What medicine is this?
- Quick heart-saving pills.

416
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,440
Oh right, oh right. This works well.

417
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,600
My husband and I put all our medicine in here.

418
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,940
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

419
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,660
After taking the medicine,

420
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,990
I could only wait.

421
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,670
So I couldn't get off that time either.

422
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,070
But that time,

423
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,850
I saw the entire process of the bus hitting the oil truck.

424
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,700
Tell me.

425
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,300
Maybe...

426
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,510
The driver was in a hurry to let me off at the next stop,

427
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,050
so he started driving really fast after pushing the pedal.

428
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,250
At that time,

429
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,990
a delivery car

430
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,760
came from the left

431
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,280
and rushed forward.

432
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,280
Wait for me, I'll be back.

433
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,850
Where's her phone?

434
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,040
I don't know. What's wrong?

435
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,020
When you were talking with her earlier,

436
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,070
did you mention the details of this accident?

437
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,790
No. We only mentioned the crash between the bus and the oil truck.

438
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,730
- You didn't say anything else?
- No.

439
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,640
Check immediately

440
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,850
if she heard or saw anything

441
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,330
regarding this accident before entering the hospital.

442
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,920
- Okay.
- Go.

443
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,990
I know you're suspecting what I said.

444
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,000
Actually, I don't even believe anything I said either. This is so outrageous.

445
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,150
But... But I'm not lying.

446
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,120
I'm only telling the truth.

447
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,950
I really did encounter something strange like this.

448
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,500
After waking up the fifth time,

449
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,330
was there anything else?

450
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,420
There's still the sixth time.

451
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,210
The sixth time,

452
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,090
I really didn't know what to do.

453
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,750
I also didn't know if I'd wake up again.

454
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,710
I'm sorry, I...

455
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,020
I saw that you were sweating a lot.

456
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,350
I was wondering if you wanted to wipe it.

457
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,900
Pervert.

458
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,810
I... I didn't mean to.

459
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,840
I was just grabbing this tissue and then the USB was pushed in,

460
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,010
so I used force to break it apart and then...

461
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,020
Pervert! Someone's being a pervert!

462
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,690
I knew that boy wasn't a pervert.

463
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,500
He just accidentally touched me.

464
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,050
But I really didn't know what else to do except blame him.

465
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,560
I-I wanted him to go with me to the police station,

466
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,900
but unfortunately the police station

467
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,020
was across the bridge.

468
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,620
I could only change my plan. I screamed that I needed to get off the bus immediately.

469
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,200
Before getting the job,

470
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,190
bus drivers must go through different types of emergency training.

471
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,960
Encountering emergencies like having a pervert on the bus,

472
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,650
they'll usually call the police,

473
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,850
secure the doors, and settle the situation at the next stop.

474
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,500
How could he stop the car

475
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,150
and let you get off?

476
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,730
I don't know. But I really dragged him off.

477
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,920
Why did you drag him off with you? He's a pervert!

478
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,640
After dragging him off,

479
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,820
I didn't interact with him anymore.

480
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,800
I just left.

481
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,290
He called a taxi.

482
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,480
I thought dragging him off would help save him,

483
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,130
but I couldn't believe

484
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,720
it harmed him.

485
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,290
Based on what you've said,

486
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,830
you're in a loop.

487
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,050
Loop?

488
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,310
Yes. It is a loop.

489
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,230
Yes, I've been continuously looped in this situation.

490
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,540
Have you had symptoms like this before, or...

491
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,710
did it start today?

492
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,940
No... No.

493
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,320
I... I also thought I was crazy.

494
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,380
But I-I already asked the doctor. She said my head is fine.

495
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,480
I got up today and went to class.

496
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,110
Afterward, I went to eat breakfast and got on the bus.

497
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,780
After getting on the bus...

498
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,820
How about...

499
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,780
I go get checked again?

500
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,260
[Incoming call: Jiang Feng]

501
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,970
Speak.

502
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,150
Master, the passenger on the taxi

503
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,020
perhaps won't make it.

504
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,670
I understand.

505
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,580
We will come find you again. Rest well for now.

506

If you think of anything, contact us at any time.

507
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,090
I'm speaking the truth.

508
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,830
I've said everything I know.

509
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,160
- Call a female police officer.
- Okay.

510
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,320
Watch her well. Call me if something happens.

511
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,140
Okay.

512
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,810
This dream is so realistic.

513
